hybrid,"[['hybrid takes place in a post - apocalyptic earth where two factions , the variants and the paladins , are battling it out all over the world over “dark matter” . as soon as you start the game you will be asked to choose a faction . both are identical in terms of weapons and movement but there are visual differences between them . after you have chosen a faction you taken to the battle map , which shows you the progress of the current "" season "" . seasons are what the game calls its online game sessions ; the first faction that collects 100 dark matter samples wins the season .', 'as soon as your game begins , you will choose a continent to play on and be shown the progress of your selected faction on the map . the progress meter shows , in terms of each region , which have been conquered , haven’t been conquered , and the overall status of both factions . i would describe it like the board game risk , where the ultimate goal is global domination . the more you fight in a region , the more progress your faction gains towards obtaining the dark matter . if your faction is the first to conquer the region , then you will gain two samples of dark matter . all is not lost however as the second team will collect one dark matter sample . this is an innovative and addictive take on the genre . instead of simply just hopping into a game and the action , you have to figure out the best region to join in order to help your team achieve victory . certain regions will also give you bonuses such as extra xp if your faction is in the lead .', 'although you will fight in regions all over the world , the maps are the same no matter which region you choose . this isn’t a bad thing ; the maps all provide some variety and different locals so they feel different in various regions . in terms of game modes , you can expect the normal offerings from a multiplayer shooter game . there is team deathmatch , various king of the hill variants , artifact ( which is a kill the carrier type game mode ) , and a search and destroy type game mode with limited lives .', 'in terms of gameplay , hybrid is not your typical shooter . you do not physically control where your character moves ; instead you move from cover to cover with the use of your jetpack . simply look at a place you want to take cover behind , press the a button and you are on your way . cover in this game is the difference between life and death . constantly flying out in the open is a great way to get killed because players already in cover will pick you off instantly . this changes up the typical run and gun gameplay formula and forces you to think about when and where you move . of course , you can shoot when you are flying through the air and sometimes , with the right weapons , this can work in your favor . if you are in cover and an enemy is on the opposite end , you can use the shoot button to blindfire over cover and take out the enemy .', 'you also have many abilities at your disposal such as grenades which , when aimed well , can take out multiple enemies hiding in cover at once or perhaps a teleport option that will instantly teleport you to cover . this can be used as a way to get out of a sticky situation in hurry or to surprise an enemy and take them out before they even know what hit them . abilities can only be used once and have a cool down period before they can be used again so deciding when to use your abilities is critical to success . there are also a plethora of weapons that you can use in the game but they have to be unlocked . every game you play nets you xp and when you reach higher levels , you gain the ability to unlock new weapons , abilities , enhancements or new helmets for your character .', 'unfortunately , the game features somewhat of a “pay to win” system . everything can be unlocked after leveling up your character but they can also be unlocked with credits ; credits can be unlocked with real money . i understand that you don’t have to pay for these items if you don’t want to but it’s unfortunate that players can spend some credits to unlock the best abilities and weapons and then stomp low level characters . the game also has some balancing issues . for example , the teleport ability combined with the double barrel shotgun makes you an unstoppable killing machine . you will often be in cover and an enemy will teleport to you and kill you with one shot before you even have a chance to react . another big problem with the game is the matchmaking system . while finding a game to play is fast and easy , you will most likely find yourself staring at a loading screen for minutes while it populates the lobby and gets the game initially set up . this is a minor inconvenience which will hopefully be fixed with a patch sometime in the near future .', 'those issues aside this game is incredibly fun and addicting . games are short , lasting usually less than five minutes but are full of fast , exciting action . you will most likely keep telling yourself “just one more game” and before you know it , the sun is coming up . i also found that the online community for this game takes this game more seriously than other shooters out there . you have to think two steps ahead of your opponents in this game . you have to decide when it’s the best time to move , the best time to fall back , the best time to use your abilities , and keep an eye on the screen at all times to keep track of your enemies . battles are fast and intense and i have had countless , heart racing rounds where both teams were tied with seconds left in the match and ends up being decided by a single point .', 'in the end , hybrid is one of the most unique , fun and addicting games that i’ve played all year . for $ 15 , this game is well worth the money and will keep you playing nonstop to get to that next level and earn your next unlock . it pushes you to come back again and again and again . if you are burnt out on first - or third - person , run and gun shooters , then you will find hybrid to be a welcome change of pace .', 'addicting and fun , hybrid proves to be a fresh and enjoyable experience on the xbla . you will easily get your $ 15 out of the experience thanks to the drive to come back and get to the next level .', '* the product in this article was sent to us by the developer / company .', '. i

person cover - based shooter by removing circle - strafing and jump - spamming as legitimate strategies . 5th cell , best known for scribblenauts , gives us hybrid , their unique take on the cover shooter , which distills the genre to its very essence : removing all that pesky walking in between taking potshots from chest - high walls .', 'the story is the very definition of threadbare . the variants have invaded earth and have killed millions of people in pursuit of dark matter , and earth’s only respite from the onslaught is the paladin forces… or so i’m lead to believe . all you really get is a brief intro cutscene which really does nothing to explain the conflict between the variants and the paladin , other than bad things happened , stuff blew up , and now you fight for dark matter . ultimately the story is there to provide a backdrop for endless matches of mayhem , and while it would have been nice to have the story fleshed out a bit more than it was , it’s not necessary to truly enjoy the game .', '[ singlepic id = 8650 w = 320 h = 240 float = left ] you start out by selecting one of two factions . the variant are the ( aliens ? cyborg ? humans in metal suits ? ) invading forces , and the paladin are the defenders of earth . the game randomly decides which faction will grant you an experience point bonus ( most likely to help keep the teams balanced and fair ) so i chose the variant forces . after you select your faction , you are treated to a brief tutorial sequence , followed by an open training level which allows you to practice in several different ai controlled arenas , and is the only single player portion of the entire game ; if you’re looking for some kind of story mode or something not involving logging on xbox live , you will be sorely disappointed .', 'the tutorial introduces the basic controls and concepts of the game . if you are familiar with games like gears of war , the basic idea is the same : you can strafe behind cover with the left analog stick , aim out of cover with the left trigger , and fire with the right trigger ( firing without aiming allows you to blindfire , helpful for when the enemy gets right in your face ) . you can choose to reload your weapon , or give a quick press of the left bumper to switch to your default pistol , in case reloading takes too long . the right bumper activates your abilities ( which i’ll get to later ) . the y button vaults you to the other side of cover , allowing you to avoid enemy fire if someone is shooting at you from that side .', 'the whole concept of the game is that , rather than running around the map , you jetpack around from cover to cover , and it’s handled ( mostly ) with ease . you aim your reticule at whatever cover you want to jet to , and tap the a button . you’ll zip on over , able to strafe back and forth to avoid enemy fire , or click the left stick in to boost faster . you can even aim while flying , which slows you down , giving you precision aiming , but also making you an easy target . a tap of the b button will send you back to the last cover you used , allowing a quick retreat if things get too hot in the cover you’re currently in or heading toward , and give you a moment to recharge your health . you can also switch cover mid - flight by tapping the a button on the next piece of cover . the controls work almost all of the time , with the occasional misfire due to an incorrect button press , but jetting around is a ton of fun , especially when boosting from point to point , taking people out along the way , and watching your killstreak get higher and higher .', 'killstreaks allow you to summon drones to help you fight your enemies in combat . one kill grants you a stalker drone , which helps to defend you personally from attack . it’s small , kinda weak , and easily taken out , but it’ll help you out of a jam . after three kills , you are given a warbringer . this guy is much larger , a bit harder to take out , and flies around the map with heavier guns . a few of these on the map can spell trouble for a cornered enemy . last , after five kills , you are granted a preyon , which homes in on a single enemy and will take them out ( if it’s not taken out first ) . killstreak awards don’t go away when you die , so if you haven’t used them , they can help bring you back into the fray when you respawn . the drones help to fill up the typical three on three matches with more enemies , thus making maps that would normally feel sparse and empty frenzied and exciting .', '[ singlepic id = 8651 w = 320 h = 240 float = right ] your character is also able to use different abilities to help level the playing field . you unlock abilities and other items by gaining levels or spending real cash dollars on credits . it may seem a bit unfair to spend your way to victory with real money , but you can only equip one item , ability , and specialty at a time , and leveling up grants the exact same abilities as those to purchase ; there aren’t any credit - specific abilities . further , you get to choose what you want to unlock in a given category each time you level up , rather than having level specific unlocks . abilities have tons of different uses , like grenades to flush out enemies , the ability to heal your team or recharge their abilities , briefly grant you infinite ammo or increased damage , allow you to tell your team where enemies or located , poison enemies , or even teleport . my personal favorite ability allows you to throw a grenade that hacks all drones in the blast radius to attack your enemies . it’s incredibly satisfying to cause five different drones to all turn on your enemies and watch the xp awards rain down .', 'in addition to abilities , you can unlock helmets and weapons in the same way . helmets are purely cosmetic , though there are some fun ones you can only unlock after fulfilling certain requirements . weapons , on the other hand , run the gamut , from assault rifles , to pistols , to shotguns , to rocket launchers , with most having some unique ability or feature . the gambler , for example , is a pistol that will either kill your enemy in one shot… or you . each weapon has unique roles to fill ( short range , long range , area effect , etc . ) and can be switched mid - match after each death .', 'specialties are unique abilities that grant passive bonuses to the player , and range from granting xp bonuses for every action , increased defense , increased firepower for either your guns or your drones , or decreasing cooldown times of your abilities . these specialties are leveled up within the metagame that ties each of the matches together .', 'both factions are fighting over a supply of dark matter , and takes place in “seasons . ” each “season” lasts until one side attains 100 dark matter , who is then dubbed the winner , and the map resets . each continent has a certain amount of dark matter , and the first to a certain amount on a continent gains a bonus amount of dark matter . continents are broken down into regions , which each contain 3 dark matter . the first faction to reach the center ( achieved by winning matches in that region ) gets 2 dark matter . the other faction can still get 1 by reaching the center . regions have different bases that can level up your specialties with the experience you earn during each match . certain regions are labelled “hot zones” and grant bonus xp for fighting in them . before each match starts , you get to choose a mission , which gives you different objectives to complete during each match . missions range from getting killing a certain number of enemies , to getting a specific amount of headshots , or fly - by kills , or a myriad of other things , which when completed , grants even more xp . there are tons of ways to earn xp , and the metagame helps to drive that “one more match” mentality multiplayer games try so hard to achieve .', '[ singlepic id = 8652 w = 320 h = 240 float = left ] there are six different modes in hybrid , each taking place on one of ten maps . artifact mode has you fight to hold on to the flag for as long as you can ; tactics has you either bombing or protecting a specific cover point with no respawns ; overlord has you kill other enemies to gain levels , which makes you stronger , and the first to level 21 wins ; king of the hill has you be the first capture a zone ; crazy kings changes the capture zone every 35 seconds ; and team deathmatch has you fight to 30 kills . most matches have you fighting the opposite faction , but occasionally the game will randomly throw you into a treason match , which has you fight members of your own faction .', 'maps are fairly interchangeable with one another ; all of them are symmetrical , and none have any unique environmental effects that differentiate them from one another . they are , however , built well , and some do have interesting touches , like cover on ceilings or walls . some are built to be close quarters matches , while others are wide open , allowing you to get to cover from several different vantage points .', 'matches are swift and frenetic , with players launching from cover to cover , firing as they fly , throwing grenades , activating abilities and drones left and right . any given match usually lasts no longer than five to ten minutes , which keeps them from getting too stale or boring , and coupled with the constant xp gains and unlocks , keeps you pressing that a button to find the next match .', 'i do have a few gripes with the game . matches can take an awfully long time to load ; first it finds players , then , syncs them . then you vote on a map , then it actually starts loading the match . since matches don’t take very long to complete , the loading can start to get a bit noticeable , though it’s not so bad as to be detrimental to the experience . graphics , while completely serviceable with a stylized and colorful futuristic setting , are a bit rough around the edges . textures are a bit flat , and jaggies are present . sometimes matches can get a bit frustrating when the opposing team starts spamming preyon drones and grenades , and you can’t seem to get a shot in edgewise ; another match is always right around the corner , though , and the ability to improve is always present in new xp awards and loadouts . some may gripe that there’s not a single player mode , not even against bots . i say that i’d rather have a solid multiplayer experience than a half - assed single player mode that adds nothing other than ticking a box on a checklist .', 'hybrid is a unique experiment in multiplayer cover - based shooting , and it succeeds gloriously . the action is frantic and non - stop , and it never gets old launching from one point of cover to the next , taking out several enemies before you even touch the ground . by focusing strictly on cover mechanics and removing all the fat , 5th cell has crafted one of the most interesting and hyperactive multiplayer games i’ve ever played . there is a constant sense of satisfaction in every single moment of hybrid , from the near constant stream of xp and unlockables , to the deluge of summoned drone attacks , to the metagame that ties everything together . multiplayer junkies , your drug has arrived .', ""i ' ve been gaming since my dad made the bad decision of buying me a nintendo when i was four years old . every day i ' d find myself with my face glued to a tv screen , punching away at buttons , getting furious with bowser , dr . wily , and those freakin ' birds in ninja gaiden . since then i have failed to get my parents to play any board game with me , i sold my full copy of earthbound with box and guide for $ 300 to some dude in austria for rent money , and i still believe in nintendo even after all these years ."", 'the homage has been a tried -

flight you can cancel the movement and go back to where you came from , or you can opt which side of cover you’ll land on . there’s also a limited boost function to get you there quicker .', 'each team is made up of three players , and if one drops out the game introduces an interesting balance mechanic that’ll boost the defense / offense of the team that’s currently short a man . for each firefight completed you’ll gain experience , which can then be used to level up and unlock new weapons , and some gear for show . there’s also an overarching mechanic in the game that has you fighting for control of resources on a world map , which is how you’ll start the game off each time . the world map is based on the actual world , meaning you’ll choose to fight in north america , south america , europe and so on . the locations don’t have any impact on the types of maps you’ll see , how they look , or who you’ll be matched up against , but they serve a purpose as a driving force for the game itself . trying to get control of all states or countries within a continent , and occasionally going toe to toe against the opposing faction for that control is surprisingly engaging .', 'the gameplay feels solid and easy enough to pick up and play if you’re at all familiar with shooters . you’ll choose a loadout at the beginning of a match , but can change that loadout with each death . you’re only able to take one weapon with you into a fight , but you’ll have another skill slotted that can serve as offense or defense , with a fairly large number to choose from after you’ve gained some levels . there’s also a skill that’s tied into the type of character you want to play as , generally causing some other type of overall boost to be factored in , like bonus xp , or a bonus to attack power . this also ties into the locations that you’ll choose to play in , as you can level up bases at these locations that’ll boost the power of this job specific skill .', 'but really , it’s the gravity defying firefights that are the big , innovative hook here , and it’s a concept that really paid off for me . there’s a level of strategy in picking when to run and when to flee that i don’t tend to see in this type of game , and i found myself instantly attached to the unique feeling that hybrid delivered . and when you get into a match with a couple other players that know what they’re doing , there’s a synergy to the teamwork that can be marvelous to watch on screen . the maps are confined just enough to keep the action constant , so you’re not just chasing guys around from cover to cover , but they also give you just enough room to breathe if things get a little hectic . there’s only one map type in the game that i found myself hating , which involves a central platform surrounded by what are basically one way halls , but outside of that i enjoyed most of the initial maps .', 'there’s not much that holds hybrid back at the moment , and i’ll be curious to see how the season results play out . there are some definite server issues that seem to be occurring , which are intermittent problems for me . at times i seem to be almost stuck searching for open matches over and over again , whether i’m searching for something specific like team deathmatch , or keeping my options open . this causes upwards of five minute waits to load in a new match , which is certainly annoying to contend with if you just want to jump in for a match or two . and while i enjoy the actual gameplay , i’m not really sold on the look of hybrid , and think that it does the game little favor in drawing in new players . it looks awfully generic on the surface , with some bland character and robot designs that did little for me . if you get your hands on a controller to play it i think you’ll find yourself enjoying the hell out of it , but if you were to casually look at the game or artwork from it , there’s not much to hook you there .', 'but still , it’s definitely worth checking out . hopefully the server and connection issues can get ironed out over the next couple weeks , because this is a multiplayer experience that i’d like to see continue on for a while , and can see myself jumping back into whenever i have some free time . despite some of those issues , i definitely think it’s worth the asking price , and think you’ll find that it is too .', 'no more paying for haircuts ! . . .', 'one of the best yakuza releases gets the kiwami treatment , making for an even better experience on p . . .', 'powered by wordpress and the graphene theme .'], ['spider -

5 ) and during your loadout before matches , you can choose a specialization along with your weapon and an ability . the specializations you choose here do not have to be the one specific to the region you ' re in , as they offer varying boosts to experience , health , weapon damage or cool -

games by former sega producer and sonic team leader yuji naka which will require some sort of tapping device connected to the wii ."", ""by this point in the game universe , you ' ve probably played using controllers shaped like guns , controllers shaped like guitars , and controllers shaped like drums . maybe you ' ve even put those fake little tennis racket heads on your wii remote to perfect your backhand . i think it ' s safe to say , however , this is the first game anyone has ever played where the required peripheral is a box ."", ""i was extremely skeptical as i read over the game specs . let ' s tap is a game that uses the unique control scheme of the wii platform in an entirely new way . you place the wiimote sideways and upside - down on a box ( the game even recommends a tissue box as the perfect size ) and by simply using your fingers to tap on the box at various speeds and velocities , you can play a handful of mini - games with up to four other players ."", ""as i said , i was highly dubious of this until i went through the helpful in - game tutorial . first up , i had to find a box . i have drawers of twist ties , random screws and old wrapping paper , but i just don ' t keep boxes in plentiful supply . worse yet , the only tissue boxes i have are the tall square ones , not the preferred rectangular ones . i actually ended up going to the post office and picking up a mailing box to use , which ended up being a great size and worked perfectly . before i get to the meat of the game , let me just register that one of the game ' s most unique and focused uses is also going to be its biggest limitation . if you buy rock band , for example , it ' s simply understood that you need the guitar , drums and microphone to play the game fully and properly . people get that . with let ' s tap , however , you need to provide your own boxes , and unless you ' re the type to buy your kleenex in bulk , odds are that you ' ll spend a lot of time scrambling around the house to play a party game ."", ""with my mailing box assembled and in front of me , i began the in - game tutorial . my default tap was way too hard , and the game encouraged me to lighten up a bit . it ' s surprising just how lightly you can tap the box and have the game still register it . i ' m not 100 percent sure how the technology works , so i ' m just going to go with magic . it ' s nintendo after all ; they do stuff like that . in the general scheme of the game , you ' ll control a little neon gingerbread man . slow and steady taps make him walk ; increase the pace but stay low on the velocity , and his walk will increase to a sprint ; and slamming the box so hard that it nearly falls off the ottoman you will result in your little neon guy jumping gymnastically . it ' s sort of a modern track and field ."", ""in this tap version of the running man ( which i think would ' ve been a way better name than the tap runner , as it ' s actually called ) , you and up to three other friends or computer opponents navigate a light - infused track and try to be the first to cross the finish line . it starts off simply , but soon there are crushing ceiling blocks to avoid , hurdles and springboards to jump over , and long - distance sprints you ' ll have to make to win . i admit that it ' s fun , but it ' s the kind of fun that would double or triple when you ' re playing with other people . playing against the computer ends up being a fight against futility because it kicks your butt while you ' re accidentally tapping the box too hard and sending your guy jumping up rather than sprinting , sliding the box further off your ottoman until it falls and scares the cats who go tearing out of the room . or maybe that ' s just me ."", ""it ' s not all neon tracks and running . another party option is rhythm tap , which i can only equate to donkey konga . a beat will scroll from right to left , and you have to match the pace and mirror the rhythm . the music is actually pretty decent , if light and generic , and the game play is fun , if a bit dated . in today ' s age of rock band and guitar hero , side -

based version of jenga . each player has a vertical tower of different colored flat blocks , and tapping slowly will hammer the blocks out of place to shrink the teetering tower . there is a tiny element of tetris or bejeweled thrown in for good measure , as combining same - colored blocks together results in a more valuable section that increases your score . it starts off simply enough , but the later levels have a lot more colors and challenge your steady hand as well as your forethought . again , this is the kind of game that excels with other players in the same room .', 'in another option , and thankfully another departure from having the word "" tap "" in its name , there is bubble voyager , which is kind of a 2 - d side - scrolling shooter of sorts . it \' s really more of a novelty than a serious scroller or shooter , but that \' s kind of to be expected . the environment is filled with all manner of oddball things like random obstacles and menacing octopuses that attempt to bonk into you . you softly and regularly tap your way around the environment , with hard slaps firing missiles — kind of the same way nuclear submarines work . i suspect most people will play this mode the same amount of times i did . the first time , i figured out the controls and general gist of things , and a second time after i understood it , only to realize that it \' s not very fun .', 'the final doesn \' t - have - tap - in - its - name game option is the visualizer . it \' s kind of a mix between an interactive screensaver or staring at your itunes visualizer : pretty , but really not much depth . when you select the visualizer mode , you can then select one of four different themes within , including fireworks , ink , paint or water . i hesitate to call it a "" game option , "" as it \' s not really a game . you can soft -

heal . fighting in districts with certain base types will grant level tiers to specializations , rewarding you with boosts to your attack power , defense rating and experience . hybrid also has an in game currency that can be purchased with microsoft points , which go towards unlocking equipment and abilities , buying cosmetic helmets , and even offering temporary experience boosters for faster progression .', 'while it’s nice to buy your way to the top , it isn’t necessary as hybrid sports a couple of methods for quick experience gains . each match you enter will present a random list of risk vs reward challenge missions to choose from ; the more challenging the objective , the more experience you’ll earn if successful . you also get bonus exp for fighting in hot spots on the persistent world map – districts on the verge of being captured by one of two factions , the paladins ( humans ) or the variants ( alien invaders ) . every battle you and your comrades fight in , win or lose , affects the continent each district makes up . each faction’s main objective is to dominate multiple regions for experience , eventually earning dark matter when a district is captured . the faction that reaches the maximum amount of dark matter across the globe ( 100 pieces ) wins the season . this adds to the re - playability of hybrid by motivating players not only to succeed in each combat encounter , but to work as a team towards overall faction dominance of the world map . oh , and don’t worry , while specialization tiers will reset to zero when a season is done , you won’t lose your rank , weapons and abilities earned to that point .', 'one minor issue i had while playing hybrid was the matchmaking system , which i found to be less then convenient . finding and connecting to lobbies , voting on maps and waiting for the fight to start can make the wait time between matches a bit unbearable ; especially since you can’t remain in the same lobby once the fight is over . one way to pass the time though is to see what your teammates are equipping during start up , which is conveniently made available via the player interface so you can determine how best to compliment your comrades play styles with your own gear and abilities .', 'hybrid is an interesting take on a tired genre that grows on you the more you play it , a game that’s surprisingly addictive despite it’s intimidating learning curve . it isn’t the prettiest game in the world , but with a consistently high frame rate , quick action packed matches and a unique form of game play tailored for the xbla platform , hybrid is definitely the game to play in this year’s summer of arcade .'], ['the best in ai . an invite -

ring - of - death xbox was returned in worked best . the game suggests that you put a sleeve on the wii - mote to minimize slipping , but i say that is yet another example of wii’s shameless self - promotion that i am just about sick to death of . if you have to use a box to play this game , you can easily find a macgyver solution to slipping remotes before going out and spending money on yet another wii accessory .', 'we put two thick rubber bands on the box , a solution which worked satisfactorily . then someone oriented the remote perpendicular to the screen ( not the suggested placement according to the tutorial ) and tapped on either side of it . we all started playing this way very soon . it solved most all of our slippage problems and seemed to respond to tap intensity better too .', 'there are five games in let’s tap . tap runner is a racing game , which starts off simply , but the higher levels have obstacles that make the races more challenging , fun , and in some cases , more random . obstacles can be anything from hurdles to tightropes to warp holes , a la portal . the person in the lead for the whole race can easily stumble over an obstacle at the very end and lose to an unexpected winner who slips by .', '[ image3 ] another game is rhythm tap , which is basically a poor man’s parappa . the display scrolls across the screen with symbols indicating a light , medium , or hard tap ; tap on the beat to get a high score . multiplayer mode on this one is impressive , as players collaborate on the piece with different parts . tap runner and rhythm tap will likely become fast favorites , to play and to watch , with both having 16 different levels to choose from – plenty by any standard .', 'there’s a jenga / boom blox clone and a bubble shooter game that are nothing to write home about , but even these might bust boredom for a few minutes here and there . finally , there’s visualizer , which is more concept than game . the only circumstance that visualizer would come in handy is at a posh loft party where the host left it on the tv and hid the cable remote . it’s annoying in a pretentious kind of way .', 'all in all , let’s tap is pretty entertaining . it will go into rotation at get -

air or boost to move more quickly , which is usually necessary to avoid enemy fire . you are able to move to any cover on the battlefield , even ones that are upside down or even on the side of a wall , and you stick to the cover like a fly on a wall . you can also retreat with another button press , but are only able to do this one location at a time , so the game almost forces you to continue to move in a forward direction .', 'other than the unique movement style , most of the game is very run of the mill . you call in perks as you build kill streaks , calling in a small stalker drones after a single kill to add support , then moving up to the warbringer drone after three kills and then finally the player - seeking preyons after five consecutive kills . this gives you a lot to worry about on the battlefield , and also where i find the game to become a little more frustrating . there is too much going on in these small matches that it makes it easy to allow an enemy sneak up on you and take you down in a matter of seconds without ever knowing how you died , or even from where .', 'continuing with the run of the mill aspects of the game , each player gains levels , and is able to choose from a variety of load outs and abilities . new weapons and abilities are unlocked via progressing in levels , each of which gives you a specific section from which to choose a new perk . for instance , you might only be able to choose only a new shotgun . if you want to buy a weapon that is not on the list , like a sniper rifle , you can opt to purchase credits via micro transactions . seemingly , someone could spend an extra ten to twenty dollars and pretty much buy every weapon and ability right from stage one .', 'another one of the big hooks that the developers of hybrid use is seasons . when you begin the game , you are able to choose a faction , either the paladins or the variants , which vary only in cosmetics . once you choose your faction , you need to choose a battleground in which to fight . the map is divided into different sections , making the entire world map a persistent and ongoing battleground . the key to these zones is to fight until you get control of dark matter at the center , and then your faction controls the zone . the first team to complete one hundred zones wins the season , and then the game resets . i like the concept , i just hope the player base can sustain the game long enough to have seasons go rather quickly .', 'the shooting in hybrid does feel very good , and each weapon has its own feeling and ferocity . there are some imbalances , but all in all it works from an actual moment to moment standpoint . there are a few game modes , mostly standard fare such as bomb the base , king of the hill and the always popular team death match . there are not a lot of different maps , and i played through most of the content pretty quickly . with the number of players in a match only three per side , things can go rather quickly . i found that the game has a pick -

person shooter that appears to reject one of the core tenets of its genre and apparently simplifies it to the barest minimum . however , despite this , it remains one of the more tactical and thought - provoking multiplayer arena shooters on the market .', 'its essential point of difference is that the player’s movement is strictly limited ; they may only move between fixed points of cover on the map , either as far forward as they can see or retrace their last move . during the automated movement , they are free to dodge by strafing up and down or side to side , to jump forwards or to change their destination by declaring a new move order mid - flight . while moving , therefore , the player is left entirely free to focus on evasion and aiming , meaning that combat becomes a matter of taking the best shots possible as a predictable course moves you towards the target .', 'strategy is added by the ability to change course mid - flight , allowing players to wrong - foot the opposition by changing direction â€“ or even aborting the move to return to their starting point and get another pass over an enemy position . this movement is boardgame - like â€“ the gears of war tabletop game uses a similar system of dividing the board into sectors and only allowing movement between specific sectors â€“ and as a result use of cover becomes paramount . knowing when to move , when to stay still and in the case of larger cover zones where best to land to avoid fire is the real strategy of hybrid and the slower pace of it makes it a game that anyone can master .', 'automation in third - person shooters is increasingly evident , with ghost recon future soldier using a similar â€œmove to next coverâ€\x9d function , but by ensuring that only two actual manual skills are needed to succeed at hybrid ( being able to aim and dodge in known ways ) and automating the rest , the playing - field is levelled considerably . while some would say removing one aspect of skill has an overall effect of dumbing down the game , the fact is for hybrid it simply makes the others more important .', 'hybrid’s armoury is unimaginative stuff , with standard machine guns , shotguns and rocket launchers predominating , although the gimmick â€œgamblerâ€\x9d weapon which either misfires ( killing the player ) or produces a single , powerful shot is balanced enough to be worth using and a skillful player will benefit from its strengths enough to compensate for the risks in choosing it . the use of a killstreak system is similarly adjusted to benefit both skilled and amateur players ; while only kills of other players count towards victory , the destruction of enemy killstreak rewards counts towards the player’s own . with the longest streak needing five points to activate , it is easy in hybrid to see all the game has to offer and as a result the powers given are not unbalancing .', 'again , the simplicity in weapon and killstreak choices ( the latter comprising two ranged - attack drones and an automated melee attack robot ) is counterbalanced by a more passive complexity , this time in the form of abilities and perks . perks are improved via the game’s persistent - world elements , where each faction as it wins games upgrades its members perk choices , while abilities are unlocked like weapons . they are activated during matches and comprise simple grenade abilities as well as more interesting advantages like weapons doing ongoing damage , or improved movement speed . the potential depth of picking a weapon , perk and ability â€“ and the largely good weapon balance meaning there are few dud choices â€“ again cement hybrid’s status as a thinking - player’s game . victory is as much about mastery of the rules as manual dexterity . while the in - game progression is supplemented by the ability to buy any upgrade immediately , there is little need to do this since in a nod to beginners , one perk offers faster experience gain in order to address level imbalance . similarly , if a game ends up with unbalanced teams , a passive bonus is applied to the smaller side to even the odds .', 'currently the main criticism that can be levelled at hybrid is a lack of content ; it has a comparative lack of maps or interesting game modes . basic deathmatch is the most popular by far and of the maps on offer , a couple are too simple in design to be fun . however , it is a game that it is quite possible to keep coming back to simply because of its accessibility without a compromise in quality ; while certain elements have been simplified to give the game its unique feel , the overall experience is still rewarding and the mix of almost turn - based , stop - and - start movement with real - time combat evokes a multiplayer valkyria chronicles of all things . furthermore , the amount of content on offer is good value for its price point , and the decision to use small player numbers in games means that each match remains fast and focused .', 'in all , hybrid may shy away from the full potential of its selling - point via lacklustre map design and unimaginative weapons , but as a complete game its mechanical innovations make it stand apart from the crowd . at the very least , this desire to innovate and bring to the foreground the action of the shooter while removing the movement makes it a unique experience within a crowded and tired genre .', 'add your comment below , or trackback from your own site . you can also subscribe to these comments via rss .', 'be nice . keep it clean . stay on topic . no spam .', 'this is a gravatar -

shaped map . both teams are locked in a power struggle to control areas of the map . no stage is off - limits , but selecting to battle in a hot zone offers additional experience points . the map has a surprising amount of depth as the choices impact doing what’s best for you ( extra xp ) or what’s best for your faction ( capturing a valuable area ) . this feature is even more intriguing because you’re entrusting your teammates ( strangers ) to make the right call . in a world where many look out for number one , hybrid captures a realistic choice with every match you play , which was my favorite part about the game .', 'hybrid does a nice job of providing choices around every corner . matches feature special side missions for extra xp , such as getting a certain kill or headshot count . matchmaking preferences let you hone in on the playstyle you prefer , but some lobby wait times are excruciatingly long – i waited about five minutes for a match to start , and that was on the saturday night immediately after hybrid’s release . plenty of the modes are borrowed from other series , such as crazy kings and king of the hill from halo . the familiar modes are varied , but it wouldn’t have hurt 5th cell to include more unique match types suited to hybrid’s particular style .', 'before you enter a match , hybrid offers even more choices regarding your weapon , ability , and specialization . the amount of choice to customize your character to your playstyle is notable . from the onset , i felt like i could alter the game to my strengths without waiting for unlocks through leveling . more selections are unlocked over time , but if you want new guns or abilities right away , you can spend microsoft points to acquire them . that doesn’t seem to skew the action in the pay - to - win direction ; with a little patience , you can earn everything can buy . the wait never felt too long to get a worthwhile unlockable .', 'gunning down enemies is plenty fun , but 5th cell tries to add a new hook with rocket - propelled movement . you battle opponents while launching between cover using a jetpack . the jetpack controls aren’t the smoothest , though , as you’re not entirely free flying . you aim at cover and fly towards it , but after that , you’re on autopilot . you can break the flight by choosing another piece of cover to fly to , using a speed boost , or strafing away from enemies . in the frenzy of battle , this is problematic , as it can cause you to overshoot where you want to land . the lack of complete control , when every other portion of the game provides it , is unfortunate .', 'in hybrid , you’re never safe from enemy fire . opponents attack you from all directions , even while you hang upside down . the cover system allows you to also strafe and vault to secure better positions , adding an extra level of strategy on the battlefield . additionally , you earn drone rewards based on kill streaks ; the higher your streak , the better drones you have to deploy . a weak drone might shoot down enemies from a distance , while a powerful one can unleash sneaky instant kills .', ""drones make battles more intense , but their ai is awful about detecting your intent and line of fire . many times i missed kills because my drone blocked my gunfire . even items like grenades bounce off a drone if it ' s in front of you . the result is realistic , but a bonus for success shouldn’t come with such frustration ."", 'the lack of map variety is by far the most disappointing aspect of hybrid . during my playtime , i thought the game featured only two or three locations , simply because every map looks and plays almost identically . for 5th cell , who brought us the creatively inspired scribblenauts , the lack of originality burns , especially in a game that’s entirely multiplayer - centric .', 'hybrid proves that you can’t depend on a few flashy additions to rev up the shooting genre ; innovation needs to go into every area possible for a game to stand out . the jetpacks and cover system are twists on standard third - person firefights , but lose their allure quickly due to uninteresting maps and the reliance on modes from other popular games . that’s not to say the game isn’t entertaining , but it lacks the staying power to keep you hooked . the goal is noble , but hybrid doesn’t turn the third - person shooter on its head .', 'kimberley is usually playing the latest rpg , sports title , or narrative - driven experience . she has also amassed more than two hundred stanley cups while playing as the blackhawks in various nhl games .', '© 1991 to game informer . all rights reserved .'], ['this year’s xbox live ‘summer of arcade’ season is turning out to be quite divisive . our man tim mcdonald enjoyed his time flashing back to the days of the amiga in deadlight , but other publications weren’t so grabbed by its other worldly charms . in a reversal of that affair , tim didn’t exactly love wreckateer , while other places went nuts for it . dust : an elysian dream stars anthropomorphic animals so it’s pretty much a given that the internet will have mixed views about that one .', 'hybrid is unlikely to alter this trend . 5th cell’s foray into the source engine powered world of jet - packed warriors and particle physics ( no , really ) managed to quite literally divide its audience on release day . those who’d grabbed the game before its servers got clogged with digital soup were eventually able to play ( once the troublesome hosting equipment had been rinsed off ) , but everyone else was left gazing at an empty space in the xbox live marketplace after microsoft temporarily pulled the title . intermittent server issues have continued to haunt hybrid during my time with it ; from some lengthy matchmaking waits to curious lag effects in matches , and further periods where the servers were completely offline .', 'that’s a bit of a problem for a multiplayer , online - only title and i can’t even begin to imagine 5th cell’s frustration at microsoft’s inability to keep their own servers up ( from what i can tell , the servers are indeed microsoft’s responsibility ) for a promoted xbox live arcade title . multiplayer audiences are fickle , fragile things and even though the server issues will inevitably settle down , many people may not be prepared to wait that out .', 'once they are able to play , prospective jet - propelled soldiers will find a third - person cover shooter unlike any other . 5th cell deserves a lot of credit here , for introducing a new , fluid style of play to a tired genre and squeezing innovation from an unlikely source .', 'let’s start with the basic set - up . australia has been destroyed by a large hadron collider accident ( sure , why not ) and now earth’s reality has run into that of an alien race . as a result , variant ( that’s the alien chaps ) and paladin ( the human rebels ) factions fight to control the planet . securing regions of the globe , by playing and winning multiplayer matches , will earn your faction ‘dark matter’ which i guess can either put australia back together again or plunge earth into variant hands forever .', 'aside from cosmetic differences , both factions are essentially the same to play . the starting weapon sets differ , but all weapons can ultimately be unlocked by both sides .', 'the game’s impressive trick is to take a shooter’s usual movement principle ( fully player controlled ) and make it a little more abstract . in hybrid , a tap of the a button while aiming at one of the clearly defined cover barriers will send you jet - packing off towards it . mid - flight , you’re able to retreat back to where you came from ( with b ) , point at another barrier and head there ( again , with a ) or boost and strafe through the air as you approach and land at your intended destination .', 'with matches in every mode restricted to 3vs3 , it ensures that battles are tight , compact affairs with a great deal of fluidity of movement ( helped by the excellent 60fps frame - rate ) . constant movement in hybrid is unwise , as you’re rather vulnerable in the air ; but cowering behind cover is just as foolish because it’s simple enough for foes to hop behind you . with cover barriers on walls and ceilings as well as floors , survival is a balance between staying alert to where danger may come from and preparing to move quickly if your position becomes compromised or a better one opens up .', 'ideally your two team mates will doing the same , and matches tend to be most rewarding when the three of you are able to work together to cover lanes of attack and complement one another with weapon / ability load - outs . with strangers , this is a bit of a crapshoot , so hybrid definitely favours squads of friends . it’s a shame the game doesn’t allow private matches , because it significantly reduces the chance of two friend - squads finding and engaging one another in a satisfying fight .', 'innovation can only stretch so far , so it’s no surprise to find hybrid applying the standard multiplayer perks / levelling trimmings around its clever central concept . these ( like the satellite ability , which allows your team to see the opposing positions for a short period at the cost of picking a more offensive power ) tend to be smartly designed , and the guns feel well - balanced for a variety of situations ( no over - powered snipers here ) . the layer upon layer of perks , abilities , specializations and global meta - gaming can feel at - odds with the general simplicity and speed of the main game , but they do all have a role to play and it pays off to experiment with load - outs .', 'what does feel a little like feature - bloat is the addition of drones , which can be summoned in combat after kill - streaks . it’s still down to a player’s tactical nous when to fire off these drones , but having ai - controlled bots cruising around already compact arenas feels a bit superfluous to what should really be pure 3vs3 contests . they also make dominant teams even harder to dislodge , which does little for the competitive balance of hybrid’s quick contests . the option to play drone - less matches would’ve been a welcome one .', 'slightly more control over game mode selection might have been nice too . you can narrow it down to a selection , but thanks to this community’s apparent natural affinity for basic team deathmatch you’re likely to end up playing that unless you opt for the category set that excludes it . sadly , this category also excludes other modes , so the chances of ending up with a game of , say , ‘artifact’ ( which sits in the same category set as team deathmatch ) are slim .', 'the ten or so maps do their jobs well enough , but are so indistinct in character that even after a few days of play i’m still not entirely sure what distinguishes , say , ‘warhead’ from ‘refinery’ . this is perhaps because the game necessitates such a laser - like focus on where barriers are that there isn’t much opportunity to take in local scenery beyond the basic map shapes . i ended up recognising the arenas as “the one with the central killzone” and “that one with flowing , circular battles” rather than by name .', 'when everything snaps into place with hybrid it feels like a novel twist on the third - person shooter concept . a match with evenly balanced teams on a map suitable for the mode of play selected can be tense , tactical blast . but reaching this point involves a lot of variables , and quite often you’ll be spending too much time gazing at the lobby loading bar or being thrust into an imbalanced match on a map you don’t especially care for . on a conceptual level hybrid stands out as an above - average shooter in a packed genre , but its reality is dogged by inconsistent matchmaking , server problems and an inessential devotion to some contemporary multiplayer fads . seeing its true potential one match in every three just adds to the frustration .', 'a courageous take on the genre that’s only able to shine intermittently .', 'all games are played to completion ( where possible ) . read our review policy for more .', 'freeman4096 : just when forza horizon 4 is about to be released ? that would be waste of money / time .', ""paul younger : that ' s not really odd as we are in the process of ramping up readership on the site . as more people…"", ""ted : this game is fantastic , haven ' t been able to stop playing since i got it . visually its a little behind its…"", 'have you got pc gaming news you want to share with pc invasion ? contact the editorial team . send us the story .', '© copyright 2018 -

based mode with a variety of objectives , most folks will stick with the arcade or survival modes , which are purely races to see who can get the highest score . game center leaderboard support is also in play and works well enough ( if you ignore the obvious hackers ) . from a gameplay perspective , darkside isn’t going to make waves in terms of innovation , but there are plenty of other areas where the game shines .', 'for a game with such a simple premise , darkside does a great job with presentation and ambience . the music and general color scheme convey a subtle dark tone . the camera angle puts you in a position of knowing most of the asteroids and enemies , but it still leaves an unknown variable that heightens the tension . since most arcade games typically lack any type of serious narrative , it’s important for the gameplay to have feeling , and i think darkside hits that mark .', 'however , i’m most impressed with just how well it implements the details . a discreet hud hangs around the edge of the planet , showing you where all the enemy ships and asteroids are . when you pick up special weapons , you can see exactly what type you’re wielding and how much of the ammo you have left . even the virtual controls are positioned in such a way to minimize your thumbs getting in the way of the action . sure , these are all small features , but they’re almost always either overlooked or hastily ( i . e . poorly ) implemented . however , they all work in darkside , which goes to show just how much care the developers put towards this game .', 'special mention should be made of the game’s visuals which are , quite simply , awesome . each planet is highly detailed and every weapon and explosion is a dazzling treat of lighting and particle effects . while darkside looks great on iphones , i’m doubly impressed at just how good it looks on a retina -

ups to make your next run even better than your last .', 'you wouldn’t know it , but there is a story here . since the last gravity guy game , the hero has been captured by aliens and taken to their ship . gravity guy has been cloned by the aliens , and each run you make is the attempt of a new clone to escape .', 'the gameplay isn’t all that different from other runners . you run across platforms , jump gaps , and avoid obstacles . the trick here is that gravity guy can lift the platforms to meet him . with a simple tap of an onscreen button , the platform will move at your command . it sounds like it makes the game that much easier , but there is still a challenge . if you can make gravity guy’s movements as smooth as possible , his running speed will increase , causing the next obstacle to race towards you . gravity guy can also perform a midair boost , allowing him to barely miss otherwise deadly obstacles or collect just a few extra coins .', 'coins can be used for in - game purchases . these purchases can net you additional abilities , often increasing the number of coins you can collect . using these power - ups will cost you each round , but , once you’re further into the game , you’ll be able to use power - ups together .', 'you can also purchase additional characters . not only do these additional characters give your hero a different look , they also come with other power - ups . these characters cost some serious coinage , so purchase wisely .', 'to keep you playing , the game offers objectives you can complete to gain experience points . these missions usually include collecting a large number of coins or running a certain distance . you’re given three missions at once , and completing all three increases your character’s experience . increased experience gives you more coins or additional slots for power - ups .', 'gravity guy 2 offers a unique gaming experience that alters the traditional platformer , but the game sometimes feels stale . the route your hero runs starts to feel overly familiar , with obstacles placed in the exact location you found them the last time . also , since the power - ups are expensive and only good for one use , this game often costs more than you can afford .', ""enter your email to subscribe to our daily email on what ' s hot in mobile games . or , take a look at"", ""and it of course should go without saying , but we ' ll say it just to make it 100 % clear -

6 years old , the app makes math fun by ‘gamifying’ it , turning simple mathematics problems into little challenges so that your pre - schooler can learn and play at the same time .', 'there are more than two dozen mini - games , split across three categories : numbers , shapes and measurements , and add and subtract . according to the developer the difficulty of these puzzles is adaptive too , so kids of any ability can be both encouraged and challenged .', 'mini dayz has launched and it’s a pixelated 2 . 5d open world that’s as brutal as the desktop version . in this game , the player is dumped on shore with nothing . they must scavenge around for food , water , and weapons while avoiding attack . it’s the kind of game where the goal is to stay alive as long as possible . but that will never be very long . it’s oddly free and seems to only have an ad on the main screen — for now .', 'pewter games has brought their charming point and click adventure the little acre to ios . it’s an amazingly beautiful animated adventure set in a sort of hybrid magical / alien world . a great all ages adventure and very fun .', 'we’d like to thank our sponsor for this week , the house of da vinci by blue brain games . there’s a reason leonardo da vinci is the only renaissance figure who routinely shows up in video games you know . with his remarkable inventiveness and genius for creative problem - solving , da vinci was a gamer through and through . he was just born 500 hundred years too soon . thankfully , there are studios like blue brain games to bring him to life in videogame form . the house of da vinci , which comes to us courtesy of a hugely successful kickstarter campaign , is a puzzler that seeks to channel the artistry and innovation of its title character .', 'you play as one of da vinci’s more promising apprentices , and you have the challenging task of trying to work out where the hell he’s gone . was he assassinated by the church ? who knows . has he quietly gone into a retirement ? perhaps . did he accidentally invent a shrink ray and shrink himself down to the size of an dustmite ? probably not . da vinci’s workshop looks beautiful , thanks to some impressive 3d graphics , and the in - game environment is crammed with all the elaborate machines and crazy inventions you’d expect to find in the workplace of a renaissance genius .', 'poly bridge is out now on ios , and it’s good to have it ! it’s a great game and many seem to agree that it’s the best bridge builder game available . but the ios versions , so far , is missing the sandbox mode . i would hope that it’s coming soon in an update . if you are all interested in physics puzzlers , grab this one .

air boost that can be activated for a little extra course correction , but for the most part you have to hope you land where you want ."", ""it ' s kind - of a pain to learn , but i eventually did start to have fun with the indirect jump controls . there are glowing green spots on some platforms that grant a significant score boost if you can time it perfectly to get guy to land on them . it takes some practice but it feels really great stringing a bunch of them together to rack up a massive score ."", 'collecting coins and gems found in out - of - the - way portions of the track contributes to a set of between - mission goals , and also gives you the dough needed to buy a variety of power - ups and new characters . the characters are a particularly big draw - they each offer up their own special abilities like automatic respawning after a failure or building up huge combos . plus , they just look cool .', ""i also have to give miniclip credit for the way they ' ve managed to balance all the coin collecting and character unlocking . it can be tough to strike a balance between being way too easy and taking far too long , but gravity guy 2 hits the sweet spot . earning enough coins to unlock or purchase what you want does require some effort but it ' s not an excruciating grind by any means , nor does it take so little effort that it becomes boring ."", ""gravity guy 2 isn ' t the nerve wracking gravity -

rodea the sky soldier,"[['rodea the sky soldier has had a long and winding journey to release . originally conceived for the wii , the demise of that console seemingly put an end to the game’s initial vision . however , a wii u version was announced alongside a 3ds version that would change the creators’ vision , but at least result in the game being playable by the general public . after a long period of uncertainty , it was announced that the game would be coming to the wii u and the first print run would include the wii version as well .', 'princess cecelia is in danger and rodea must do his best to save her . while the story isn’t the most compelling thing in the world , it is enjoyable enough and it’s reasonably well acted too . it’s played as almost a cartoon , with overacting – but not to a grating degree . rodea gives a subdued , confused robot delivery while coming off as genuine . otherwise , the voice acting is good enough to get the job done , but won’t compel anyone on its own merits .', 'the game’s real core is its blend of flying and ground - based mechanics . the sky soldier is aptly named because he soars through the air and is also capable of shooting enemies down if need be . most of the time , you can get by just spinning through them either on the ground or in the air – and that is a bit like sonic , which is pretty fitting . yuji naka’s games excel with either a fast pace to them or a loose , arcade - style vibe , and that is evident in rodea the sky soldier .', 'sonic was a mix of speed and platforming in a world with very tight level design . nights was basically a speedrunner’s dream game with a score attack mode blended in with some almost puzzle - esque boss battles . rodea is very much a hybrid of those games in its time - and score - based approach to level progression . the third - person mechanics are also very much like burning rangers in that there’s a very good concept at the game’s core , but the mechanics don’t gel together in the most cohesive way . despite that , the game is still a wonderful experience and greater than the sum of its parts .', 'rodea’s concept is a bit left of center , and so are its controls to some degree . the left stick moves you around , the right moves the camera , and y sends you in the air . this is where things get a bit shaky , because while you can aim with the left stick , your aiming is a bit imprecise for everything . targeting and then dashing forward can work reasonably well , but the camera can get out of control and lead to needless deaths . pressing down on the d - pad allows you to get out your blaster while x blasts away at enemies .', 'most of the time , an air or ground dash will take out foes – but when that doesn’t work , the blaster comes in handy . it does less damage compared to the dash , but has minimal risk compared to the dash since that can send you bouncing all over the place . it’s a frustrating issue and one that never quite goes away as you’re usually in either tight - quarters on the ground or on small islands . it doesn’t affect air spin attacks all that much though , which is good .', 'you’ll definitely want to mix things up with your attacks , because each has a limit . you can’t be in the air too long or you’ll lose all power and fall into the ether . likewise , you have to wait to recharge your blaster , so one effective strategy can be landing a few air attacks and then landing . after you land , survey the scene and prepare a plan of attack . do you want to run through some blaster shots and take out enemies in a risk - free fashion ? doing so is safer , but adds time – so if you want to speedrun things , that isn’t a great option . sometimes though , you’ll find that the fastest option is the safest – like when a coin path also sends you into enemies over the ground . you can grab the coins in an instant - grabbing sequence kind of like a sonic loop - de - loop and then dash into enemies without having to worry about dying due to your flight meter running out of juice .', 'the most - impressive looking parts of the game are probably the air - based sections since they have the most - lush visuals . you’ll see enemies and a sky as far as the eye can see . most importantly , you won’t see many muddy textures on enemies unless you’re super - close and you can’t see the nasty - looking textures on the ground and walls . while some games on both the wii and wii u use unique graphical styles to make the most of their hardware , rodea is a muddy - looking mess that appears to have been ripped from 2005 – and wouldn’t have been a huge looker then . still , you can tell that they wanted to craft something epic , but like the original xenoblade chronicles on the wii , the hardware just wasn’t up to the task . the animation is perfect for what it needs to be though , and the cutscene graphics measure up to modern standards quite nicely – with a fantasy rpg art style to them that fits nicely .', 'as mentioned before , the voice work isn’t all that good – but luckily , the music makes up for it . it’s a great blend of fantasy tunes and fast - paced fun - loving fare that would fit right in with a sonic or nights game . it’s classic sonic team stuff and with yuji naka at the helm , that seems fitting . it may not be as catchy as either of those , but remains a fun listen throughout the adventure .', 'while its controls have a high learning curve , and the graphics don’t dazzle like one might expect from a latter - day wii u release , rodea the sky soldier is still an outstanding experience . after you spend an hour learning its nuances , the controls become second nature . that’s when the game’s full potential can be reached…and it’s still held back by the camera and tendency to bounce you all over the place . luckily , those issues are fairly minimal in the overall game and don’t affect a high percentage of the adventure . if you want something truly new to experience , then give rodea a shot .', '——————————————————————————– this review is based on a digital copy of rodea the sky soldier for the wii u provided by nis america .'], ['html public "" -

ended flight gameplay , similar to nights into dreams . within the confines of each semi - open level , rodea can move around on foot , jump , hover , boost attack enemies , and blast off into the sky . the gist is that he has a limited flight time ( it ' s actually rather generous ) , and once his meter is expended , he must either pivot off of a solid object , or land on the ground and start a new flight pattern ."", ""it ' s jarring at first , but it ' s easy to get the hang of after about 30 minutes , and you have a huge degree of freedom . some of it is even automated ( grabbing pickups , grinding wires ) , but never to the extreme degree of the 3d sonic titles . although the gamepad does support off - screen play , there ' s no need to even look at it , as the controls are entirely traditional on wii u ."", ""the open design works both for and against rodea . while it ' s amazing to look into the horizon at times and see areas you can readily explore , the draw distance is often so poor that it ' s tough to plot out a full course . additionally , a lot of zones tend to blend together , with entire areas that have nothing more than empty plains seemingly unfinished . rodea also starts to falter when it adds more elements to the mix beyond its core conceit ."", ""while the boost attack is fairly foolproof ( it ' s a lot like the 3d sonic games ' homing attack ) , gunplay is shoehorned in . it isn ' t fun at all . the fact that the controls feel dated isn ' t entirely the player ' s fault , as the entire game feels like something out of last generation , and possibly even a generation before that . that ' s not to say rodea doesn ' t sport a beautiful art style - - because it does - - just that occurrences like slowdown , pop - in , and occasional glitches are present more than they should be ."", ""individual missions can get boring , but flying is always a joy , and bosses are often the highlight . they ' ll range from humanoid fights to giant hulking monstrosities , and both varieties are a blast while they last . this is a decently long affair , with over 25 levels , upgrades to purchase , and even a secret shop with extras like an additional mode . you can expect anywhere from 15 - 30 hours once everything is said and done . you rarely see things like this outside of dlc , so it ' s refreshing that the game feels so feature complete , even if it technically has three different versions in the end ."", ""rodea the sky soldier really hits that sweet spot when it comes to evoking the wonder of flight , but the troubled developmental process is tangible in the final build . for those of you who can stomach older experiences however , you ' ll likely overlook some of its issues and find a lot to love ."", '[ this review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher . ]', 'you are logged out . login | sign up', 'solid and definitely has an audience . there could be some hard -

looking textures . the discrepancy between the concept art and its actual visuals is disappointing . it’s not particularly easy to pick up and play , either : the flight controls take some getting used to , and the rushed tutorial at the beginning isn’t much help .', 'but even when you do get the controls down , being able to consistently go where you want to and target properly isn’t a guarantee . you aim your flight bursts and attacks with the left stick , but the camera often fights against your best interests . since you only have a limited amount of flight energy before you need to land , not being able to target quickly and properly is a huge annoyance . this leads to many cheap - feeling deaths as a result of running out of juice and falling off the stage . attacking can be a big gamble , too : though it purports to auto - target the nearest destructible object when you tap a then b quickly , it seems just as likely to send you quickly careening off the edge of a level . rodea has a lot of frustrating moments like these , and since it uses a traditional “lives” system , every accidental death leaves you closer to having the restart the entire ( usually fairly lengthy ) stage .', 'one of the bonuses included in rodea’s physical release is the original wii game . it has numerous significant differences from the wii u version , such as using the wii remote and nunchuck controls for movement , and is said to be the closest to the creators’ original vision for the product . however , this version is not included with the digital download from the nintendo eshop . it’s just in the first run of the physical release . since gamesbeat’s digital review copy did not include this , i did not take it into consideration .', 'above : the imagination at play in rodea’s world is admirable .', 'the wii u version of rodea is simultaneously a game with a lot of charm and one that’s difficult to love as much as you want to . when rodea works and all of its gears are cranking along smoothly , it’s an exhilarating joy to play . but everything can come crashing down at any time : an enemy encounter reliant on overly finicky aiming or a misplaced attack that sends you careening into the abyss can sour the sense of wonder in a flash .', 'rodea’s high points are lofty indeed , but the experience as a whole has too many pitfalls to be wondrous .', 'rodea the sky soldier is out for the wii u and nintendo 3ds on november 10 . the publisher provided gamesbeat with a digital download of the wii u version for the purposes of this review .'], ['yuji naka is a legend in the world of game design . he has worked on notable series such as sonic the hedgehog , nights into dreams and phantasy online for nearly 30 years . his newest creation , rodea the sky soldier , has been stuck in development limbo for over five years , but the time has finally come for it to see the light of day . naka has already expressed that he would like to work on a sequel to sky soldier , but does the flying action title deserve such an honour ?', ""sky soldier is first and foremost a yuji naka game . it looks , sounds and plays like many of his previous forays into the realm of 3d platforming . this is both a gift and curse , as it shares their charms but also their aggravating gameplay flaws . if you ' ve ever played sonic adventure for the gamecube or nights journey of dreams for the wii , then you ' ll have a good idea what to expect from sky soldier ."", ""with the titular character , rodea , knocked unconscious for a staggering 1 , 000 years at the beginning of the game , players have to stitch together his sordid past as his memories return and the story progresses . why was he built ? why does he have a human heart ? what happened to all he knew and loved in the last millennium ? it ' s a decently compelling story that keeps players guessing , as rodea encounters those from his past who seem to know more about him than even he does . in classic naka style it ' s a bit too corny and over the top , though that ' s just the kind of charm you would expect from a title like sky soldier ."", 'if there \' s one issue that holds the story back it \' s that one of the two main characters is unfathomably annoying . that would be ion , the robo -

such a serious weapon seems out of place in such a goofy fantasy setting . rodea is a solider after all , but it has the same feeling as sonic team giving shadow a gun . which totally happened , and was certainly a bizarre move . odd weapon choices aside , the machine gun and other sub - weapons work much better on land - bound enemies than rodea ' s normal charge attack ."", ""one of the best aspects of sky soldier ' s combat is the fact that players can actually upgrade rodea ' s abilities and weapons as they conquer more stages . soon players will find rodea flying with a bit more speed and purpose , which meshes nicely with the fact that players will likely ( hopefully ) have a better grasp of the game ' s flight and combat controls by that point ."", ""though the stages involved are nice and open for rodea ' s flying pleasure , they almost feel a bit too empty at times , with sparse enemies and large expanses of sky between platforms . this is to be expected as the component of flying is obviously key to the game , but the creators certainly could have beefed up the levels with some more challenges and obstacles that truly tested rodea ' s abilities further . players can interact with special star chains as they fly , and if they connect rodea with the first star they ' ll be whisked through the line at sonic speed . the issue here is that the lines usually end at the edge of a floating land masses , dropping unsuspecting players into a freefall . only after adapting to the quick start and stop of the star chains will most truly begin to enjoy linking them all together for a fast pass through the stages ."", ""the weakest aspect of sky soldier , by a wide margin , is it ' s rage - inducing camera . it ' s an issue so amazingly essential to gameplay , and so poorly done , that it will certainly have some swearing under their breath . since rodea ' s sky battling and main form of movement all center around targeting new opponents and objects , a wonky camera can be very troublesome . if players try to find a solid point to lock onto they may have issues , especially during some of the game ' s larger battles where the range of flight is enhanced . it ' s easy for the camera to get stuck behind walls and enemies as they fly into view , putting us ( and rodea ) at a huge disadvantage . this doesn ' t always happen , but it happens enough to make the game feel a bit too off kilter on a regular basis ."", ""with two dozen chapters , decently long stages , as well as plenty to collect and unlock , sky soldier is just about as lengthy as one would hope . each stage ends with a dazzling display of various letter ratings that are linked to players ' chains , star collection , completion time and more ; this adds some extra challenge for those who want to truly master the game . those who simply want to complete the main campaign may not find as much meat , but there is much to explore if you ' re up for a little sky sleuthing ."", 'rodea the sky soldier is an interesting game . when it comes to unique gameplay and classic yuji naka charm the title truly soars . unfortunately it also suffers from frustrating camera problems , a steep learning curve and some frequently aggravating combat . players planning to taking to the skies with rodea will likely enjoy most of their journey , but they are in for a bumpy ride .', 'too many other games beg for my money over this . maybe way down the road with a decent sale .', ""i saw the gameplay on your channel . i ' m glad i ' m skipping this ."", ""i ' ll be skipping this game for now . xcx will demand all of my gaming time , and i don ' t want to be distracted or grow my already - huge backlog ."", ""i ' ve already got my copy at home waiting to be played but i did expect it to be a good but flawed game . are the controls and camera problems present in the wii version ?"", ""i have a feeling that if i don ' t pick this up now i won ' t get another chance . it ' s sort of been released at the wrong time . and in any case the wii version may not be included further down the line and that sort of sweetens the deal ."", '"" if you \' ve ever played sonic adventure for the gamecube or nights journey of dreams for the wii , then you \' ll have a good idea what to expect from sky soldier .

few years . originally announced for wii back in 2010 , yuji naka’s latest brainchild was all set for release before it fell off the face of the earth . it wasn’t until 2013 that publisher kadokawa games revealed that the 3ds version of the title was approaching completion , and the following year announced that the console version had been moved from wii to wii u , tweaked and redesigned along the way . finally , thanks to nis america , prope’s intriguing third - person action game has finally arrived in north america .', 'awakened from a 1000 year rest , rodea , a robotic soldier with a vow to save the floating continent of garuda , travels with his chatty engineer friend ion on a journey to combat the nefarious nation of naga . while rodea enjoys the power of flight , he can only glide through the air for a certain amount of time before his gravity energy is depleted and he plummets back to the ground . grabbing gravitons , yellow gems laid out in lines and loops throughout each stage , or bounding off the side of a structure or enemy , allows him to recharge his gravity energy mid - flight and continue without touching down . this limitation forces players to be deliberate in their navigation of each stage , and also wraps some reasonable restraints around rodea’s fantastic ability . flight begins in pre - flight mode , which leaves rodea spinning in midair while the player selects a direction to head in , and the hero can boost , juke , and rise at will once he’s on his way . it’s a little awkward in practice , mainly because the nature of the game’s flight mechanics have changed so much since their original design on wii .', 'though obvious efforts were made to sharpen the visuals for the game’s transition to wii u , rodea is an unmistakable product of the wii era . its textures are muddled and muted , and especially stand out after recent releases like kirby and rainbow curse , splatoon , and yoshi’s woolly world that emphatically illustrate the graphical power of the nintendo’s latest console . the jagged level , enemy and character designs are all scars from the game’s turbulent development , while the cutscenes look especially stilted and puppet - like in comparison to the beautiful and emotive character portraits used during dialogue segments . it won’t impress anyone with its visuals , but the most significant change to rodea during its journey to wii u is its control scheme . prope originally designed the game to be played with the motion - sensing wii remote , allowing players to point and click to specific areas of the screen to guide rodea’s flight with intuitive ease . shifting to a more traditional twin - stick control scheme is effective , but the game loses much of the fluidity and responsiveness evident in footage of the original wii version . it’s an unfortunate concession , but rodea ‘s problems can’t be blamed simply on its rocky development history . sadly , its flaws are much more fundamental .', 'for a game centered around flying , the act itself is far too jerky to illicit the liberating sensation prope sought to capture . the point - and - click trajectory selection is effective in guiding rodea around each stage , but he snaps to different destinations at such jarring angles that it’s hard to really feel like you’re in full control of your flight . rodea’s movement lacks the graceful arcs and responsiveness of yuji naka’s other creations , and it feels like prope never quite managed to manifest its vision in a manageable control scheme on wii u . the loose controls make navigating the sprawling levels far more challenging than should be necessary , and even when you finally begin to bend the mechanics to your will , the camera frequently obstructs your vision with disastrous results , often killing your momentum and even rodea himself .', 'the stages are largely linear , but they rely on verticality and exploration to entice the player into making the most of rodea’s amazing ability . the first few are bland , barren collections of floating islands that demand little more than flying from point a to point b , but the stages begin to become more complicated as the campaign is delved further into , making compelling use of rodea’s maneuverability . these more intricate and populated levels maintain a careful balance of action and speed , at least until the designers begin to throw in all sorts of tedious challenges . tasks like defeating a horde of enemies in an enclosed area or searching for a selection of switches completely take the wind out many stages’ sails , and along with sporadic difficulty spikes the game’s pacing is often infuriatingly inconsistent . rodea also attempts to incorporate a number of additional tools and mechanics , like a rifle for rodea , but they’re used so rarely and have such limited effects that they feel out of place . somewhere during the developments process the designers seem to have lost sight of their creation’s defining elements , as they’ve hidden them between frustrating segments that betray the freedom and excitement inherent in rodea’s flight .', 'it may be flawed , but at the heart of it all is an intriguing design concept , and there are moments of exhilarating flight and combat sprinkled throughout rodea even if prope didn’t nail the execution . the game hits its stride after the first few chapters and as the levels open up and become more populated , prope begins to throw more creative and challenging sequences at the player . i enjoyed barrel - rolling away from enemy attacks and quickly striking them from behind , as well as winding my way through the nooks and crannies of later stages using all of rodea’s maneuverability . the game’s frame rate , however , frequently suffers during the more visually hectic moments , and i fell right through a couple stages that should have been solid — issues that are simply inexcusable for a game that has supposedly been finished since 2011 . time may not have been kind to rodea , but prope also hasn’t done its long - awaited title justice in its current state . that’s a terrible shame , because the aesthetic and premise are captivating , and rodea himself is a brilliantly designed character that deserves a better debut than he’s received .', 'fans have waited a long time for rodea the sky soldier , but unfortunately the final experience never comes within range of yuji naka’s past masterpieces . the issues begin with the fundamental mechanics of flight and persist into its pacing , controls and stability , ultimately tainting even the most joyous moments of freedom afforded by rodea’s affinity for the open air . there are moments of bliss that shine through the mess , but the pure celebration of flight that prope set out to deliver on wii has lost many of its most important features during the transition to wii u , and in the end , rodea the sky soldier fails to live up to

spins and dashes as he traverses the skies defending the world of garuda from the naga empire . but unlike its spiritual ancestor sonic , rodea the sky soldier has a more relaxed pace and a new , experimental control scheme . originally designed for the wii , this version of the game has adapted the motion controls from the old wii remotes to make use of the wii u game pad’s traditional controls , and it arguably changes the game a great deal . but is it for better or worse ?', 'gameplay focuses on how rodea moves through the sky . to fly , you merely have to jump , point to your desired location on the screen with an on - screen reticle and press a to launch rodea in that direction . if you want to change direction mid - flight , simply point somewhere else and press a . think of it as an on - the - rails action game where you build your own rails on the fly . your flight time is limited , so you have to take breaks between flights and land on the many floating islands that you pass by . but navigating by ground is often just as necessary as flight . occasionally to progress you’ll need to take out enemies by launching into them while using a boost attack or by shooting at them from afar . alternatively , the collection of items within a restricted space can also be the key to opening the way .', 'rodea the sky soldier carries so much potential for fun , interesting game play but it falls short of providing an engaging experience . this game suffers from poor level design . the environments are often large , but barren . enemy behaviour can be unpredictable and / or unfair . the controls are sluggish and occasionally unresponsive . you can only point at objects in range and the third - person camera moves so slowly that if you start to fall from an edge you may not have time to recover . it’s such a shame , because on the surface this game has all the elements of a great time - waster . the idea of point - and - shoot flight and battle mechanics is a stroke of genius , but its improper execution in the wii u version makes it unsuitable for the second - rate level design . despite the introductory tutorials the game doesn’t properly prepare you for the kind of challenges you’ll face .', 'to be blunt , the game’s graphics are bland . the colours have been washed out , the art direction is dated , and the attention to detail is lacklustre . what should have looked crystal clear on a high definition screen instead looks compressed and old . but it’s not all bad . the image is sharp , yet smooth enough to still look pleasing

other hand , has played an integral role in producing various sega hits including phantasy star online while also working as the head of team sonic . he even took the helm as the lead programmer on nights into dreams , arguably one of the sega saturn’s few triumphs .', 'although it has plenty of ambition and a unique core premise , rodea bears the cost of a troubled road to development , feeling invariably outdated as a result . born from an early idea naka had of designing a game set in the skies , a wii version of rodea the sky soldier was said to be finished as early as 2011 . however , naka and his team needed japanese publisher kadokawa to launch the game . clearly , in the time between then and its eventual release , some changes were implemented .', 'for a start , the game has now released on both the nintendo 3ds and wii u . what’s interesting about this change of platform is that rodea the sky soldier for wii u comes with a bonus disc containing the original wii version too – at least in pal territories . despite arriving on newer hardware , it has to be said that the two newer editions of the game have few improvements to offer over that original version .', 'whether playing on nintendo latest handheld or home console , rodea looks remarkably basic . everything from environmental textures down to character models are mostly downright featureless and , at best , rudimentary . in other words it’s a relic and although it might have flown by unnoticed back in 2011 , four years later , it’s a caveat that cannot be overlooked .', 'each stage follows a core visual theme . as you journey through the besieged kingdom of garuda , you’ll come across floating archipelagos inhabited by imperialist mechs , as well as larger , more robust complexes like factories and cities . although there’s plenty of scope to go and explore each of these environments , rodea follows a linear design structure , making it very clear where a level starts and ends . scattered between these two points is often a cluster of objectives , requiring you to collect specific objects , destroy incoming enemies , or simply move on to the next location .', 'what’s unique about rodea is the web of mechanics it extends to the player . if yuji naka and the team at prope did one thing right , it was creating a control scheme that feels like nothing you’ve ever played before . of course there are plenty of familiar elements but the way it all comes together is refreshing , even if a bit unwieldy .', 'following a simple jump , players can hit the button again to make a reticle appear on - screen . when hovering over a solid surface you can press it once more to guide rodea in that direction . while in mid - air , however , a number of options present themselves . aside from being able to change trajectory , rodea can unleash a boost that also doubles up as his primary attack .', 'although you can glide through most areas of the game without confronting enemies , combat will become a necessity at times . it’s during these moments that the control scheme gets itself into a bit of a muddle . as rodea unlocks new abilities , you’ll find yourself struggling to press the correct button the right number of times while also considering the direction and speed at which our sky soldier is flying .', 'out of the different , handheld players probably have it the worst . beside the seemingly mute 3d effect , they also suffer from the lack of robust camera controls . although the shoulder buttons can be used to shift the player’s view at preset angles with each press , it doesn’t feel all that intuitive . some might call it demanding but we’d have thought that , with a new model having been around for almost a year , prope could have somehow incorporated the new circle pad / nub in its control scheme .', 'that said , there’s still fun to be had in soaring through the air , bouncing off of enemies and scouting out the game’s various collectables . it’s just a shame how suddenly the action can grind to a halt due to some poor control design .', 'more content than your typical action adventure game .', 'looks poor , even by

noble ideas buried deeply within the game , but serious technical flaws inhibit just about everything it aims for .', 'it is a game that comes from the typical artist that was cut from the early era of sega . the strengths of yuji naka ( the guy who brought sonic to life ) do not lie with storytelling or in the weaving of complex tales . apparently it is a creative weakness that he is aware of , and so instead keeps the narrative firmly backgrounded , setting players the goal of flying through linear platformer - like levels on a quest to take on and defeat the ultimate boss to a happily ever after for everyone else . it’s actually a pity that he has helmed this project , because there are hints of something in there that would be worth expanding out , under the guidance of a director with a firmer grasp on storytelling .', 'rodea , the titular lead of this particular tale , is a robot that has little understanding of what he is tasked with doing . awakened from a deep slumber of 1 , 000 years in length , all rodea understands , at first , is that there is an evil naga empire that he needs to defeat in order to save the kingdom of garuda . his only ally on this quest is a mechanic , ion , and brief as the narrative is , it touches on themes around humanity , the relationship between robots and people , and so on . squint and it’s almost – almost – possible to imagine that this is a riff on the kind of narrative that', 'offered , albeit as a platformer rather than an epic jrpg . but it’s told nowhere near as well , and the voice acting performances are straight out of the worst sunday morning cartoons that you’ve ever seen . seriously , the “talent” voicing these characters needs a career change . preferably to something where they’re banned from talking .', 'what also lets the narrative experience down is the environmental design , which does almost nothing to enhance the storytelling . what we’ve got here is a series of platformer levels which , it is worth noting , are not even designed to be traversed on foot , but rather flown across , preventing players from ever having a physical interaction ( and thus connection ) with them . these platform levels are placed in sequential order from one another . it’s an arbitrary gauntlet of enemies , moving hunks of rock , and traps , with no actual reason to be in the shapes and designs as they are , beyond “to be a level . ”', 'franchises , because it was never the narrative pulling these games together in the first place . but , as i noted before , rodea actually has a thematic basis that deserved to be explored . we’ve seen other platformers make remarkable use of level design to enhance their narrative – alice : madness returns , contrast , limbo , and puppeteer , all had stronger narratives thanks to the care and attention put into making the level design count and link back into the rest of the game . rodea’s positively old - school approach to level design has some light charm behind it , sure ( especially for fans of retro games ) , but offers precious little depth beyond that .', 'but that’s not rodea’s biggest problem . oh no . the game , beyond the narrative , suffers mightily from its need to also be a game , and a very limited understanding on how to make its flight mechanics work . the core to the system is in engaging a double jump , and then using the distance above the air to glide towards destinations . the ability to lock on to enemies or other objects in flight then allows the player to “boost” towards those objects , either to reach objects of interest or do damage to enemies .', 'but this system in hindered by a couple of core issues ; firstly , the camera is terrible . i never quite managed to get it under control , which meant that flying towards specific

camera , but equally an issue with the engine’s stubbornness , i had a great deal of trouble changing targets rapidly . layering on top of that was an unnecessarily convoluted set of control mechanics

ground , moving his fastest when he ? s in the air . he has only a limited meter once he takes flight , though , so rodea will need to find a solid piece of land to settle on to let the meter quickly refill ? sans grabbing certain items mid - flight that refresh his flight power . this actually provides a nice challenge in stages where lots of bottomless drops abound , forcing you to balance how you get to the end of each level .', 'the flying could have been so much more fluid and fun had the game ? s controls not turned out completely unintuitive . instead of allowing you to just fly around using the control stick , you have to aim at where you want rodea to fly , then press a button to set a marker on a safe spot . once you ? ve done that , rodea will move along the path toward the marker you ? ve placed . if you want to course correct , attack an enemy , or deviate in any way from the original path , the entire concept falls apart . i could see where , if you had to use the

of affairs . when targeting an enemy , you can lock onto them like you would in one of the 3d sonic games , with rodea even spinning around to gear up for the attack . if enemies are grouped together , though , the inability to easily link attacks was a sad realization . i often had to individually target them ? which , admittedly , was still easier than flying ? but i lacked the speed or rush that even the worst 3d sonic games were able to produce .', 'the weakest element of combat , though , is easily something i thought i ? d never see again in a game like this : guns . channeling his inner shadow the hedgehog , rodea has machine guns and other firearms that he can earn over time , allowing him to slowly aim and take pot shots at the enemies around each world . it was at this point that i nearly threw the wii u controller out of sheer frustration because , while the gun mechanics work , they destroyed any semblance of pacing that the game was trying to achieve .', 'rodea isn ? t a complete letdown , though . showing at least a semblance of evolution from the projects of a decade ago , the game features a fleshed - out upgrade system for the titular hero . killing enemies rewards rodea with spare parts that he can then use to upgrade his armor , attack , speed , and other attributes between stages . he can also unlock new moves and better weapons ? should the whole machine gun mechanic not bother you as much as it did me .', 'surprisingly , the game ? s boss battles are also a fair amount of fun . since most of them are mammoth in size , set in the game ? s

rodea the sky soldier was never intended as a wii u game . in fact , it sat in development purgatory for four years , originally planned on being released on the wii back in 2011 . why the game was delayed so long is beyond me , but it looks like nothing has been done with all that extra time ? causing a lot of rust to collect on rodea ? s visuals and gameplay .', 'graphically , the game is a mess ? it would look bad even as a last - gen title . barely populated worlds , wide stretches of land painted in the same bland color , and even large segments of a stage flickering in and out of existence as rendering fails to keep up when rodea reaches a decent speed mar the the experience . all this makes rodea easily one of the ugliest games i ? ve played in a long time .', 'rodea is also a joke in terms of gameplay , seemingly taking all the worst elements from naka ? s previous games and mashing them together . rodea can fly around a level or run around the ground , moving his fastest when he ? s in the air . he has only a limited meter once he takes flight , though , so rodea will need to find a solid piece of land to settle on to let the meter quickly refill ? sans grabbing certain items mid - flight that refresh his flight power . this actually provides a nice challenge in stages where lots of bottomless drops abound , forcing you to balance how you get to the end of each level .', 'the flying could have been so much more fluid and fun had the game ? s controls not turned out completely unintuitive . instead of allowing you to just fly around using the control stick , you have to aim at where you want rodea to fly , then press a button to set a marker on a safe spot . once you ? ve done that , rodea will move along the path toward the marker you ? ve placed . if you want to course correct , attack an enemy , or deviate in any way from the original path , the entire concept falls apart . i could see where , if you had to use the original wiimote , pointing at the screen constantly , this might not have been as bad as it is . but using the wii u gamepad ? s control stick to aim instead caused rerouting rodea in mid - air to become a chore , especially with the overly sensitive camera swinging around trying to correct itself . never before has flying in a game ever felt so restrictive .', 'the combat is also a sad state of affairs . when targeting an enemy , you can lock onto them like you would in one of the 3d sonic games , with rodea even spinning around to gear up for the attack . if enemies are grouped together , though , the inability to easily link attacks was a sad realization . i often had to individually target them ? which , admittedly , was still easier than flying ? but i lacked the speed or rush that even the worst 3d sonic games were able to produce .', 'the weakest element of combat , though , is easily something i thought i ? d never see again in a game like this : guns . channeling his inner shadow the hedgehog , rodea has machine guns and other firearms that he can earn over time , allowing him to slowly aim and take pot shots at the enemies around each world . it was at this point that i nearly threw the wii u controller out of sheer frustration because , while the gun mechanics work , they destroyed any semblance of pacing that the game was trying to achieve .', 'rodea isn ? t a complete letdown , though . showing at least a semblance of evolution from the projects of a decade ago , the game features a fleshed - out upgrade system for the titular hero . killing enemies rewards rodea with spare parts that he can then use to upgrade his armor , attack , speed , and other attributes between stages . he can also unlock new moves and better weapons ? should the whole machine gun mechanic not bother you as much as it did me .', 'surprisingly , the game ? s boss battles are also a fair amount of fun . since most of them are mammoth in size , set in the game ? s larger arenas , it ? s easier to target their weak points and bring them to their knees ? even if many fall into the classic ? three hits and you ? re dead ? gaming trope . it ? s such a shame that getting to the bosses is such a grind , leaving them feeling like a brief respite instead of the culmination of a well - designed level .', 'it ? s sad that rodea the sky soldier stayed buried for so long . had it released in 2011 like originally intended for the wii , this might ? ve been a much better handling game to play , and wouldn ? t have looked nearly as bad as it does next to the wii u contemporaries it now has to contend with . the saddest part , though , is that yuji naka doesn ? t seem willing to completely let go of his past ? and , if anything , accidentally makes the case for why the beloved characters and gameplay he created in his early game design days no longer fit in the modern gaming realm .', 'developer : kadokawa games / prope ? publisher : nis america ? esrb : e10 + – everyone 10

developed and the original version was revamped to be a wii u title .', 'with such a long development period , and an iconic figure like naka on board , one would hope that the final product would be memorable . unfortunately , that is far from the case . rodea is , unfortunately , visually bland , tricky to control , and usually more frustrating than fun . it shows its age in many aspects , and feels like a botched transition between consoles in terms of the control scheme and mechanics . players looking for the next japanese sleeper hit will have to look elsewhere .', 'the story begins with a prologue chronicling the invasion of the floating continent garuda by the power - hungry kingdom of naga . the titular rodea , a protective robot with flying abilities , is sworn to protect cecilia , the princess of naga , but she ends up going against her father’s wishes and stealing an artifact that’s important to her nation’s success , as well as sending rodea into a millennium - long hibernation after telling him to protect garuda .', 'centuries later , rodea’s inert body is revived by a plucky mechanic named ion , though he wakes up with a case of amnesia regarding his past . when naga’s emperor starts another attempt to conquer garuda , rodea remembers cecilia’s final request to stop the invasion , and sets off with ion across the world of floating islands to take down naga’s armies .', 'though dialog and cutscenes aren’t sparse , the game still sports a thin and forgettable story . the characters aren’t interesting , and the plot is forgettable . furthermore , rodea’s amnesiac shtick is beyond played out in the world of japanese games .', 'the actual gameplay for rodea is very unique . you actually spend very little time on foot , as you have the ability to target environmental objects , items , and enemies with the right analog stick , and send rodea flying towards them with the push of a button . this also serves as your primary way of attacking , as holding down another button will double rodea’s speed and cause him to rapidly spin for extra damage . players still have to be careful not to fly nonstop , though , as rodea has an energy meter that gradually drains as he flies , which will lead to death if it runs all the way out .', 'despite being creative and unique , the way this whole system is pulled off results in far more frustration than fun . the right analog stick feels too sensitive and imprecise for easily locking on to specific elements , and rodea’s movement when flying feels slow and unresponsive . apparently , the original wii version of the game made use of the wiimote’s motion controls and allowed players to manually aim for more precise targeting . it’s baffling that the option to use wii controllers has been removed completely from the final retail game , as it would probably result in a much more enjoyable experience .', 'other elements also result in a far from satisfying experience . the graphics look straight up crummy , with blurry textures and bland , sparse environments . as a result , the game feels more like a rushed remaster of a wii game than one where the developers took the time to touch things up a bit . it also incorporates a finite lives system in the worst way . if you finish a level with one life left , it will stay that way if you go into a new level , and even if you turn the game off and come back later . considering that many levels are both overly long and often have frustrating segments that are difficult to nail on the first try , players can look forward to having to slog through missions that last upwards of 20 minutes again and again .', 'when the only genuine praise you can give a game is that some of the music and character designs are good , something’s wrong . rodea the sky soldier feels like a title that should have been so much more . it’s entirely possible that some of the bigger issues could have been prevented if the original control scheme was still included , as it sounds far more efficient , but unfortunately , that’s not the case . this is a lame , forgettable and often frustrating experience that wii u owners shouldn’t bother with .', 'this review is based on the wii u version , which was provided to us .', 'any intriguing ideas that rodea the sky soldier contains are unfortunately offset by botched controls , mechanics and presentation , resulting in a major disappointment .'], [""for years , yuji naka produced a number of classics with sega , then chose to break off on his own to work on other developments with his studio prope .

pretty cool documentary about its development . except for the fact that the game just doesn’t have much hype and it’s not anything groundbreaking . you see , rodea development began in 2010 when yuji naka came up with the concept . you may know yuji naka from his work with sega as head designer / programmer for the sonic the hedgehog series , as well as nights into dreams . during rodea’s development , it transformed from a wii title into a wii u and 3ds title , and finally in november of 2015 it launched . naka mentioned in 2011 that the wii version was complete , yet it never saw release . so after playing rodea and doing some research about its history , i’m interested in hearing the full story as to why it took this long for a completed game to be released .', 'before i go into the story and gameplay i just want to mention that naka’s original version of the game for the wii is included in the first print copies of the wii u . i have not had the chance to play the wii version as it was not provided for this review , but i can tell you based off some of the videos i’ve watched of it , that it looks to be the superior version of the game . more on why that is , a bit later .', 'the story of rodea : the sky soldier begins 1 , 000 years ago with the emperor geardo looking to take over the kingdom of garuda . his plan to unleash his machine army called the naga is foiled by princess cecilia and our robot hero , rodea . we fast forward to present time and rodea is discovered by an inventor named , ion . he returns rodea to working order , but rodea doesn’t remember exactly what had happened . he discovers that the kingdom of garuda has been peaceful for 1 , 000 years but that might not last , since the naga have returned to take over .', 'rodea plays out primarily in the skies of garuda and is very inspired by the gameplay of nights into dreams . overall the gameplay reminds me of a mix of nights into dreams and the sonic adventure franchise . how could that turn out to be a bad thing ? the game is broken down into chapters that are separated by a world map . at the world map you can also upgrade rodea’s abilities which add some nice depth to the gameplay . once you begin a chapter you realize the stage layouts have a mostly linear design with a clear ending area , which is very much like the sonic adventure games . flying through the skies is your means of defeating enemies and making it through the stage . the problem lies with how this is achieved through the wii u version .', 'controlling rodea on the wiiu is just too frustrating , between the camera angles , flying , and the game mechanics . the flying is achieved by jumping into the air and moving an on screen icon around to direct which area or item rodea should fly towards . while doing this you are also tasked with controlling the camera and avoiding any other obstacles that might get in your way . it just isn’t fun or intuitive . then you have the ground controls which you would think can’t be worse than the in air controls , but they are annoyingly similar . using the standard jump makes rodea jump extremely high and with no rhyme or reason . trying to grab an item that is on a platform near the ground is way too frustrating and is just very clunky . i honestly thought i was done wanting any games that played out using the wii remote and nunchuck , but after playing rodea on the wii u and watching some videos of the wii version , i can safely say that the wii version is the definitive version as far as how it should be controlled .', 'i also feel i need to talk about the game’s graphics . i don’t want to sound like a graphics whore , as it’s something i usually don’t speak much about in my reviews , but the graphics in rodea : the sky soldier are pretty brutal . i understand the game’s development started in 2011 and was intended to be a wii title , but it’s just laughably bad in most areas . if the game was intended to be a throwback to the dreamcast then i would redact this statement , but this is 2015 and this game looks like it belongs on the gamecube .', 'next up on my beat down list of rodea : the sky soldier , is the cut scenes and localization . i know it’s a japanese game style of having an anime image of a given character with their mouth moving , but it just doesn’t work for me . between the characters interacting in this regard and the laughably bad english dialogue , i was never truly invested in the story or the threat that emperor geardo possessed ( i was hoping for rick sanchez to come and end the gear wars once and for all ) . i know a lot of the dialogue is intended to be in the “so bad it’s good” category but i couldn’t enjoy it at all given how little i was enjoying the gameplay .', 'i was really excited to play rodea : the sky soldier because i feel like there aren’t enough new ips coming out and publishers are going to the well too often on sequels and reboots . so i’m extremely disappointed that i could barely find anything redeeming in my experience . i can really only recommend rodea for hardcore yuji naka fans and serious game collectors . having the first print editions include the unreleased wii version is a great selling point and probably the only way i would ever return to the skies of garuda .', 'no more paying for haircuts ! . . .', 'one of the best yakuza

and the graphene theme .'], ['the development surrounding rodea the sky soldier has been a muddy path to say the least . early reports indicated that the game would be published on the nintendo wii in north america after xseed had expressed interest localizing it back in 2011 . then , after a few years of stalemate , the game was said to still be in development by kadokawa games and now looking to nis games for localization efforts . for the north american release , kadokawa instead detailed the nintendo wii u and 3ds as the targeted platforms .', 'the nintendo wii version of the game had launched in japan years back , and the wii u and 3ds versions released april 2015 . following suite , the game now reached a north american release on november 10 , 2015 , having the first copies of the game include the original wii version . it was a surprise to me that kodakawa games pressed for a physical release of the game on the wii u . this is what sparked me to gain interest in the limited edition , purchasing it based on looks alone . and , as an avid collector of all things gaming , there are often monetary rewards for purchasing the limited edition of a game under the assumption that the print copies would also be just as sparse . who could pass up a limited edition copy of a game that also included its original wii counterpart , right ?', 'everything included with the limited edition purchase of rodea the sky soldier .', 'there’s no doubt that rodea finds comfortability in the simplified control scheme often seen with the use of a wii remote and nunchuck . this is particularly the case as it highly favors a point and direct style of play . with the inclusion of the wii u gamepad , the controls then become mapped as a traditional controller scheme . the worst assumption about the change in controls from a point and direct style is the fact that would actually work in the translation to the gamepad . and , disappointing as it turns out to be , they are horribly executed .', 'the reticle seen in the gameplay trailers is much different than the actual game on the wii u . it is directed by the analog sticks . the “a” button hurls rodea into the sky , while tapping it again leaves him to fly in a given direction . however , this environment where flying occurs is not a free - to - fly about realm . instead , only certain areas of of land and floating islands can be selected to fly to . i often felt the games rigidity and unwillingness to move in any other direction than the linear flight path ahead of me . this became the biggest issue as there are many elevated areas to venture to . with the stiff controls , i was often left on the underside of rock formations , struggling to simply get above ground . instead of flying on a given arc or trajectory , rodea often clumsily mashes into pillars and other structures as its the only route available .', 'platforming from flight becomes a task .', 'simple things , like climbing onto a platform to avoid moving electric plates , becomes troublesome as you have to flight first above the plateau and then aim towards the ground . a latching mechanic for climbing ease would have alleviated these simple frustrations .', 'the movement in these sometimes vast areas is slow and unexciting in comparison to how it should feel . pressing the “b” button will enact a honing spin attack which can also be used to advance towards a target at much swifter pace . there are upgrades that can be added to your flight abilities along with various other unlockables . other forms of gear can be unlocked through destroying enemies and gathering parts . even with the upgrades in things like your assault gun you carry , the combat system , weapons , and overall gameplay is broken to the point where it is almost unplayable . simple things like the machine gun , instead of being fun to blast enemies and then jump to a sky attack for more damage , are punishable offenses as reloading the weak weaponry is hardly worth the parts gathered to upgrade it . gathering parts becomes another unwanted task as the vast majority of buggy and choppy gameplay plagues almost every aspect of exploration and battle .', 'there are a nice array of upgrades to be had for those willing to collect parts .', 'after a few chapters , i got to the point where i was done with the learning curve of the game and encountered something that resembled a sense of mastery , or dare i say it , fun . it was at this point when rodea had combo’d a few enemies and then shot through a couple fast - moving speed portals that i really felt that the game was finally starting to show what it was really meant to do . i had even searched for lower platforms where hard to reach medals could be found . i even spent time defeating massive enemies for rarer items to be collected for upgrades . the areas where gravitons are present , it felt fun as i picked them up on their trails as they slung me through the sky at high speeds . then the joy came to a screeching halt .', 'after trampolining off of an enemy and then attempting to reach a platform above , i was then hurled into endless space only to fall to my death . you see , flying comes as an expense rather than a reward . so , the amount of time spent in the sky is limited . even running out of the flight ability leaves you falling uncontrollably to your death as you can’t even float towards steady ground to recharge your flight ability . you simply fall from great heights until you lose what often times is your last life , pushing you to start the entire level all over again . this underwhelming set of abilities leaves the core mechanic of the game itself broken , and simply not fun to use . it comes off as botched , something more like what you would have seen on the vast list of wii shoevelware releases . this doesn’t even touch on the times where i was hurled through the muddy , blurry , uninspired textures that are found in every piece of landscape in garuda .', 'on one hand , you have a game that surpassed expectations on ever being published as a nintendo title . the idea for the game was the product of yuji naka , head of the original sonic team . he had envisioned what the story and gameplay would be like for a soldier of the sky . i mean , having delivered on such games as the nights franchise , you would think that this would be an easy task . on the other , it was poorly designed in almost all aspects , including the core mechanic on what could have possibly made the game something to marvel on the nintendo wii u .', 'while the cinematics and storyline are fairly eyebrow raising and interesting , the rest of the game is a broken platter of inedible stale pastries . at the end of

40 graveyard ? the game manages to capture the sounds of the seventies , but it fails to elicit the tone of the movie . tarantino was not involved with the development of the game – which may be lucky for him but not for us .', 'i do admire the attempt of the developers to expand upon the action sequences of the movie , many that were just alluded to in conversation . in this way there is a distinct difference between the movie and the game . the game obviously lends itself to action so it just screams to be taken advantage of . it just doesn’t blindly follow the plot of the movie but elaborates on what happened to each of the main characters after the botched jewelry heist . you will see some of the main scenes from the movie rendered in cutscenes in an attempt to tie things together . the dialog is cut short and underplayed in virtually every instance , to the point that you wouldn’t really know what was going on if you weren’t a fan of the movie . i say fan because i’ve only seen the movie once and there’s just too much information to absorb in one viewing . the game certainly doesn’t clarify matters . to get the most out of this game , one would have to think of this game as an augmentation . but it’s the lack of fun gameplay elements that will keep this game from reaching the same cult status as the movie . there is nothing unique about it as it features linear shooting and driving missions for all of the main characters . it’s redundant and anticlimactic as it fails to bring little understanding to the characters’ backgrounds or present situations , not to mention that the control system is awkward thanks to some sloppy gameplay mechanics .', 'at the heart of the game are a variety of missions for each of the characters . these missions are so similar that after a few hours it’s difficult to differentiate them . there are two main gameplay elements , shooting and driving . during each shooting level you will have to get to the end of the level in one piece while outwitting or out - shooting gangs of cops and swat teams . you can play each level as a professional , without firing a single shot , or you can just go crazy and shoot at anything that moves . you will be scored on your performance at the end of each level as either a psycho or as a professional . your overall score will determine the ending at the end of the game . i took the middle - of - the - road approach , as more of a career criminal with a blend of shooting and strategy . i just couldn’t be bothered to replay the game to see any of the other different endings . it just wasn’t enough of an incentive to me considering the redundancy of the gameplay . that redundancy also manifested itself with the environments that saw repeated textures and even entire rural streets .', 'guns are the weapons of choice and there is a decent assortment of handguns , shotguns , machine guns and even a sniper rifle . for some unknown reason the cops don’t seem to have a sniper rifle in their possession . in order to play as a professional you will have to grab a hostage and order the cops to drop their weapons . some will respond to your orders to face the wall and drop to their knees while others will need more convincing which comes in the form of beating on your hostage . when you have enough adrenaline in your meter you can unleash a special attack in which you will torture the hostage ( although it’s not shown on the screen ) or you will knock the hostage out and send him or her to the floor . this leaves you wide open but for some strange reason causes all of the cops in the area to drop their weapons . all the time this is going on you are never in danger of being shot by a sniper . if you do shoot the hostage the cops will pick up their weapons and begin firing – so there is some semblance of sanity and logic here somewhere .', 'to get labeled as a psycho , you just go around shooting and avoiding cover . the lock - on targeting system isn’t bad but you have to unload a lot of rounds to take out a cop , which doesn’t work to your advantage when they are shooting at you . all you can sustain is a few shots before you give up the ghost . you can attempt to take cover but the controls don’t always allow you to get in the right position . sometimes you’ll end up hugging the wall instead of hiding behind it , leaving your character open for a lead filling .', 'the pace of the levels is slow . they are rather large and take a long time to navigate . they aren’t open - ended as in grand theft auto so you don’t have that same feeling of freedom . since so much of the rural area is generic , you don’t feel like exploring it anyway . you just maintain your focus of getting the hell out of it and on to the next mission . driving is the second main gameplay element but it’s hampered by light feeling vehicles . they are difficult to control around turns and often skid out of control causing more damage than you may have intended . you are gauged on the driving levels the same way that you are on the shooting levels . the more damage that you cause the more “psycho” will be reflected in your score .', 'despite the all - star cast of the movie , only one of the actors , michael madsen , returned to add his voiceover talent to the game . the rest of the characters are voiced by impersonators which do an admirable job but let’s face it , nobody can nail buscemi . the dialog is a blend of original and new , which all fits together seamlessly . i couldn’t tell you what’s from the movie and what’s been added so it can’t be that out of place . the cutscenes are great but the in - game graphics are fuzzy , stiff and in some places just downright nasty . hey , at least the soundtrack rocks . no sound - alikes here .', 'the fact that this game is named after the movie reservoir dog is going to be its greatest selling feature . it’s doubtful that this game could stand on its own if it weren’t for the famous name holding it up . the tie -

a - dozen , it is fairly hard to get excited by yet another game that is based on a movie . that is , of course , unless it is a game based on the cult - classic quentin tarantino movie reservoir dogs . in perhaps tarantino’s best film , the story revolves around several criminals with color - coded nicknames such as mr . blue and mr . blonde . these criminals band together to plan , execute , and hopefully get away with a diamond heist . although the movie had great storytelling and dialogue , most of the action that is discussed throughout the movie happens off - screen . this is where reservoir dogs : the game steps in to help complete the film .', 'reservoir dogs : the game will thankfully not be just another play - through - the - movie game . however , most of the game will consist of playing through the action - filled plot gaps that were left out of the film . fans of the movie who wonder how mr . blonde went psycho during the heist or question where mr . pink hid the diamonds will want to play through this game to discover the answers to these and other burning questions raised by the film .', 'by completing each mission , players will discover the answers to many of these questions . the game will be a third - person action game with some driving levels also included . each level in the game will be centered on the actions of one specific criminal at a time . all of these levels will be selectable at the start of the game allowing players to choose in which order they wish to play through the game . this is an interesting feature that should allow fans of specific characters to instantly satisfy their curiosity .', 'reservoir dogs , while entertaining , may cause some controversy upon its release . it has already been banned in australia due to the game’s violent content . while the movie it is based on is considered to be violent , players will be able to complete the game without killing anyone . that’s not to say that this would be an easy or even desirable option . this does , however , allow the player to determine how violent they want the game to be . if you run and gun through a level creating unnecessary havoc , the game will give you a psycho rating . however , if you take hostages to negotiate with the police and complete a level without mass murder , the game will rank you as a professional . both of these options could be satisfying in their own way but fans of the more psychotic path will likely appreciate that each criminal will have their own specific torture move ( cutting off an ear as mr . blonde ) . these torture tactics look brutal and should help to expedite the disarming of nearby police officers .', 'fans of reservoir dogs will be happy to know that the game’s soundtrack will be the same as the films . since the music helped set the mood of the film , it should help the game seem more like just an extension of the movie . unfortunately , not everything from the movie will be in the game . of all the original cast members from the movie , only michael madsen’s ( aka mr . blonde ) voice and likeness will be included in the game . the game’s other characters will look slightly different and have different voice actors . while this is somewhat understandable , it still would have been awesome if they had included the movie’s entire original cast . this complaint aside , reservoir dogs should still please fans of the movie who seek answers to some longstanding questions about the films characters .', 'gameplay that fills in unseen action from the movie .', 'all levels are selectable from the beginning of the game .', 'character -

mash of his own geeky adoration of obscure gangster movies and hong kong action flicks ( ringo lam ' s city on fire being a major inspiration ) but it was still an audacious , hugely influential slice of cinematic nirvana , laden with eminently quotable dialogue and a soundtrack to die horribly for . above everything else though , it was cool ."", ""some 14 years later , with all the pace of a limping greyhound , the games industry has finally caught up with the tarantino craze and eidos has released an officially licensed tie -

grabbing pop - up problems , it ' s the shooting levels that at least break some new ground - albeit gently and with a blunt pickaxe . viewed over the shoulder , your task is to generally guide each character from one room or outdoor setting to the next without getting blown away . although it ' s perfectly possible to kill everyone in your path , using the same find - cover - and - fire controls and stock selection of guns and grenades we have seen a hundred times before , the game ' s smart crowd control system ( all reservoir dog ' s key features are cleverly named after snippets of dialogue from the movie ) can help prevent levels from becoming a bloodbath . simply grab an unguarded cop or civilian , jam a pistol to their head and threaten to blow away the hostage if anyone takes a step closer ."", ""tougher opponents , like swat members , won ' t back down too easily and a quick clunk on your prisoner ' s head with the butt of your gun will be needed before they reach for the sky . once an enemy has put down the weapon , you simply hold r2 and guide them to a wall , where they will crouch until you leave . hit a hostage too often though and they will drop dead , resulting in every available cop reaching for their gun and blasting away . this , coupled with a constantly flagging energy bar for each hostage , means you have to perpetually find a new victim to coerce or start shooting . fortunately , the combat engine is pretty sturdy and spontaneous gunfights rarely descend into hitman - style chaos . plus , if you have taken enough hostages or wasted enough enemies , an adrenaline meter fills up enough for you to go into bullet festival mode . not unlike the slow - mo western thrills of red dead revolver or gun , time slows to a crawl for a few seconds so you can take a few choice pot shots at surrounding would - be killers before returning to normal speed , with gratuitous cut scenes then showing each bullet hitting its mark . again , this is nothing new but it ' s carried out with style and is very satisfying in that sick sadistic way that jack thompson will abhor with every fibre of his being . wisely , merciful players though are rewarded with better career rating than trigger happy killers , who get branded psychos , so that should temper any reactionary groups . well , maybe a little bit . . ."", 'yes , i think he might be dead now .', ""and that leads onto to another major question about reservoir dogs ; is it really that violent ? quite simply , no it ' s not . the game is certainly no more bloodthirsty than gta and , despite the odd shotgun decapitation , pails in comparison to classic brutality benchmarks manhunt and soldier of fortune . mr blonde ' s trademark ear removal technique can be pulled off by building up adrenaline and then pressing the triangle button while holding an enemy but , like the movie , the camera cuts away for the worst part - leaving the real gore to your imagination . the actual level of violence is hardly shocking and has been greatly exaggerated , much like it was ahead of the film ' s release ."", ""throughout the game , the presentation is very strong and , for the most part , befitting of such a venerated license . when your character steps into the daylight , even on the ageing ps2 the graphics are quite impressive . they may not match the next gen competition but this is still a decent looker that manages a consistent frame rate throughout . music wise , all the favourites from k -

ip , it was for the dreamcast and went by the name sword of the berserk : guts’ rage , which came out in may 2000 for sega’s ill - fated console . yuke’s – who are now known for handling the wwe games for 2k sports – picked the right genre for the game , an hack and slash that felt like a conversion of the scrolling beat em’ up into a 3d world . sadly , for me , while it was great seeing guts transition to video games , it did not escape the issue that a lot of license games suffered from in that generation – being an average video game .', 'a sequel , berserk millennium falcon chapter : the holy demon war chronicles , appeared four years later for ps2 , but was limited to japan , so i never got to experience it . it’s been over 12 years since the last game , but with a trilogy of berserk films retelling the golden age arc out on dvd / blu - ray , and a second anime season , which originally felt like it was never going to be created , now available , the team at omega force ( developers of warriors / musou games ) have picked a good time to revitalise the ip to video games .', 'berserk and the band of the hawk starts from the beginning with the most well known arc , the golden age arc , the story featured in the first season of the anime , but goes past that and into the falcon / hawk of the millennium empire arc , but doesn’t manage to finish the conclusion of that story . some corners have been cut when it comes to detailing the events of berserk , either through censored scenes from the anime ( such as a certain arm being detached ) or skipping over stories . interestingly , in the golden age arc most of the key points are hit fairly well , backing up each mission with videos ripped straight from the three berserk : the golden age arc films . with that source material at hand , the developers have managed to offer a good vision of guts’ life and the world he inhabits for people who have never seen berserk .', 'things take a turn for the worst when it finishes up the golden age arc and moves onto the black swordsman and onwards . with no animated source material left to attach to the missions , omega force was left to create their own cg shorts for a replacement , and they aren’t as polished , which is something that is easily noticeable after watching the film animations for the first seven hours of the game . the pacing of the story also increases , as it relegates small arcs to single stages , where in the previous half of the game , the stages were extending the battles to see the bunch of misfits led by this mysterious and charismatic griffith bonding his group of mercenaries together . it’s a shame that the second half is so glossed over , because it is at that point where the world of berserk becomes extremely different , and it also these parts of berserk that haven’t had time to shine just yet , as the anime is still catching up to the falcon / hawk of the millennium empire arc , so only the manga readers know what the game is rushing over as it comes to its conclusion .', 'i believe a warriors game makes perfect sense for berserk . in fact , the main character , guts , is known as the hundred man slayer ( there’s an amusing joke from guts about getting another strange nickname for killing 1 , 000 men in the game , something that is a common occurrence ) , and so having an entry in a series that is known for slaughtering many enemies feels right at home , and at first it looks like it’s doing the right things .', 'visually , the artists have done a decent job at bringing the darker tone of berserk to life . the models look good , especially close ups , giving them a distinctive look that manages to blend kentaro miura’s art style ( the creator of the manga ) with the game’s stylish display . keeping with the gruesome nature of the anime , models become covered in blood of their enemies after decimating whole armies in just a few minutes , making it uncommon to see characters clean during the action . koei tecmo weren’t lying when they advertised this as their most violent and bloodiest warriors game to date . level design is not as pleasing , with many maps being corridors or boxed arenas surrounded by some average looking environment detail . it’s a sacrifice made to allow so many models on screen at once , and while the game is aiming for a 1080p60fps presentation , it does drop often . at the moment , there is no ps4 pro support , but there is supposed to be a patch incoming to make the frame rate stable on ps4 pro systems .', 'i am a little disappointed with berserk and the band of the hawk when it comes to the gameplay . missions aren’t inventive , sticking true to standardised warriors formula focused on either killing something , protecting something or surviving for a certain amount of time .', 'the problem is with what i just mentioned – the game feels like a warriors game from a generation or two ago , an entry that has lost all the enhancements that have come with such games as samurai warriors 4 – hyper attacks were a smart inclusion that cut the time spent killing mindless soldiers – that made the series step up to become something more than a shallow hack and slasher . with those improved mechanics stripped out of berserk and the band of the hawk , what’s left is a combo system based on light and heavy attacks , but does not include much variety to experiment with various combos . characters have minimal combo strings built around x amount of presses then a triangle press or two to switch up the combo . even the inclusion of side weapons doesn’t help to remove this issue . it’s cool to see the characters enter their ferocity state to deal incredible attack damage ( watch those bodies explode into fountains of blood ) , and using the souls of the enemies to power up another metre to finally use a powerful finishing move ( the musou special of the game ) , but it’s not enough to match the depth that the recent mainline warriors games have .', 'with so much killing involved , it’s a shame that the developers decided to base it around the old warriors formula , as the gameplay repetition cannot be saved by its cast of characters . unlike warriors orochi 3 , which had over 120 characters to change up the combat , berserk and the band of the hawk has a measly eight playable fighters . each one does come with a unique fighting stance , such as guts being the walking tank of death , especially so when he becomes the black swordsman , coming with increased speed and attack to make him a real body exploding machine . others like griffith are speedy and light on their feet , based on fencing actions , casca mixes up her light sword skills with physical kicks and punches , and schierke can use her magic to make her vastly different from the other characters , but there isn’t enough here keep the excitement flowing andit left me wanting more fleshed out mechanics .', 'the story mainly has guts at the centre of attention , so other characters become more frequently used in free mode , a place to replay any of the game’s missions , but with any of the characters who are currently unlocked . this is due to characters in the story mode being relegated to a stage or two . this tale is about being guts , because he’s the freaking badass , right ? more so with the berserker armour , an almost godlike version of guts that makes the game easier to beat on the harder settings .', 'guts in this game is made for slicing through multiple characters at once , but one area where the combat falls flat is on the bosses . these can be human sized opponents or towering monsters , but they all suffer from being damage sponges . it should be exciting fighting a unholy demon like nosferatu zodd , instead , it becomes a tedious boss fight where nothing seems to flinch them as players slowly reduce their multiple life bar down , repeating the same combo again and again with the occasional dash to avoid an incoming attack . the combat mechanics don’t feel suited for big boss fights , and with the camera having issues in placing a good viewpoint on huge monsters , it’s a struggle to find something satisfying in participating in boss battles .', 'outside of the story , apart from the free mode already mentioned , the only other content included is endless eclipse . this is an fascinating additional , because it takes an idea of an endurance mode and spices it up with randomised dungeons as players try to reach layer 100 to unlock rewards by finishing desires ( challenges ) to move up layers . it also includes rewards that can only be unlocked through this mode , such as one special boss character wyald – why it’s him , i do not know , as he isn’t that exciting of a character , he’s just very big . with each character having secrets unlocked within endless eclipse , it becomes the mode of play for replayability , while also giving characters ways to gain experience and gain new accessories to equip to buff stats or infuse with other accessories to make better gear to survive longer . but the issue is there was only so much of this i could do before becoming bored of the game as a whole . cooperative play isn’t even an option , so players can only slog through the contain on their own .', 'berserk is a nice fit for omega force’s warrior / musou series , but i was left a little disappointed that they took a step back with the gameplay . what this means is that berserk and the band of the hawk feels like a late ps2 entry in a franchise , where as the mainline series is currently taking the right steps to improve itself for the better . fans of berserk will get a kick out of the story mode , as this is clearly a game that takes its adaptation seriously , and with much love from the team that created it . it’s fun being able to become guts and deliver some bloody ass whooping in this astonishing , yet tragic , story , but being stuck mechanically in the past is a sin i never wished for in my ideal concept of a berserk warriors game . berserk and the band of the hawk is cast away into the depths of the eclipse as a gory

increases going forward .', 'otherwise , combat is predictable warriors fare . levels are compact but packed with enemies , the number of playable characters is small and front - loaded , and the text

against all odds , it works out , and you get something surprisingly enjoyable . other times , you get hollow action games that simply use a classic film as a crutch to peddle unremarkable gameplay , and end up offending the very audience at which the game proclaims to be for . eidos interactive ' s reservoir dogs falls distinctly to the latter end of the spectrum . based on the cult - classic quentin tarantino film about a group of foul - mouthed robbers trying to sniff out a rat among their group after a jewel heist gone wrong , this third - person action game tries to justify its existence by expanding upon many of the questions left at the end of the film . the problem is that none of the answers are very interesting . these new sequences act less as legitimate fan service and more as a hackneyed means to put you through a series of boring , clunky , and disjointed shooter levels , as well as some painfully frustrating driving sequences ."", 'the reservoir dogs are back , filthy mouths and all .', ""as a film , reservoir dogs told the tale of the rainbow coalition of bank robbers , mr . white , mr . blonde , mr . pink , mr . blue , mr . brown , and mr . orange . a collection of unassuming crooks hired on by a salty old gangster named joe cabot and his son , nice guy eddie , this crew planned , executed , and subsequently fled a jewel heist that was broken up by the arrival of many , many cops . many suspect a set - up , and we learn bit by bit the events that led up to the formation of the crew , the heist itself , and the eventual breakdown through a completely nonlinear storyline . generally speaking , the game version of reservoir dogs tells the same tale , though not with as much exposition and dialogue to properly set things up . you get many of the key scenes from the film in cg cutscenes , but it ' s safe to say that if you haven ' t seen the movie this game is based on , you ' ll frequently find yourself confused as to what ' s going on . you don ' t really get much of the background info on any of the main characters . the game simply rushes through the parts of the movie that actually explain things to try and get you into the action as quickly as possible . in that way , reservoir dogs seems specifically designed to be a companion piece for those already familiar with the film . unfortunately , it ' s a pretty unpleasant companion ."", ""fans of the film might be wondering how , exactly , such a dialogue - laden , action - lite crime drama could work as an action game . the answer is that it really doesn ' t , though not from a lack of trying . the developers turned the individual escapes and chases vaguely alluded to in the film into full - blown gameplay sequences . novel idea , except that the rootin ' , tootin ' gunplay parts and blues brothers - inspired car chases seem completely out of line with the tone of the film . basically , the answer to every question of what happened to one character or another is that they found themselves running through one generic - looking environment or another , encountering scattered gatherings of cops from time to time , until they got to the exit . or , they found themselves driving a car , trying to get from point a to point b without exploding . these exact scenarios happen over and over again , and they aren ' t fun in the slightest ."", ""to be fair , reservoir dogs does make a vague attempt to play to the mentality of a smart criminal by letting you take hostages , rather than simply blasting your way through every cop that gets in your way . as you move through a level , you can take any nearby , unarmed person hostage . this slows you down considerably , but cops won ' t fire at you as long as you ' re holding an innocent person in front of you . initially , you can just make verbal threats to get cops to put down their guns , and once they do , you can target each of them and take control of them . once you move an unarmed cop over to a wall , you can force him to get on his knees with his hands behind his head and stay there . some cops won ' t respond to verbal threats , so you can simply rough up the hostage a bit to show you mean business , and they ' ll eventually back down ."", ""there are many problems with this system , not the least of which is the fact that you ' re disabling entire police forces and swat teams by smacking around a single hostage . granted , most crime action games don ' t rely on realistic police tactics to be fun , but the very conceit that a cop will stay on his knees - - face to a wall , even after you ' ve turned your back to him , with a gun on the ground six feet away - - is tough to swallow . and where are the snipers ? the most ridiculous aspect of all is a special move you can pull off after you fill up your adrenaline meter ( which , of course , fills up as you cause more chaos ) . with this move , you do a particularly brutal attack to your hostage that actually knocks him out . this leads all the cops in the vicinity to lay down their arms and immediately surrender . so , to recap , you ' ve just beaten a hostage senseless , knocked him to the ground , and given the cops an open target as your human shield is now on the floor . and these knuckleheads with submachine guns decide it ' s time to lay down arms and give up ?"", ""you ' ll take hostages frequently if you want to survive . it also slows the pace of the game to a crawl ."", ""logic leaps aside , the mechanic itself also happens to make the action completely boring . the theory here is that you could actually get through reservoir dogs without firing a single bullet , but doing this is no fun at all . you move so slowly , and the levels often take a good bit of time to get through , so you find yourself slogging away at a snail ' s pace , repeating the exact same sequence of actions to get multitudes of cops to surrender over and over again . and as a final nail in this idea ' s coffin , sometimes it doesn ' t even work . sometimes cops will randomly pick their guns right back up after dropping them , forcing you to smack a hostage again and again until they finally stop getting sassy with you ."", ""you can choose to simply blast your way through levels , though that ' s only slightly more fun . you can use a few different weapons , ranging from multiple pistol types to shotguns , machine guns , and sniper rifles . the problem is that aiming and shooting is incredibly inaccurate . you can target specific enemies with a target - lock button , but even then , your ability to hit them is suspect , and when you do , it takes dozens of rounds to finally put any enemy down . your only chance of survival with this method is to use cover , but even this doesn ' t work very well . once you line yourself up with a wall , you can peer around corners and shoot decently enough . but actually getting your character to line up with a wall is a chore . sometimes they ' ll do it , and sometimes they ' ll roll in some random direction or just stand there getting shot to death . you can take only a few bullets before you ' re dead , as well ."", 'some of the action and driving sequences just seem totally overwrought for a story that is , in essence , a drama , and not rooted in a lot of crazy action .', 'depending on which way you play a level , either as a violent psychopath or a consummate professional , this all ties in to a rating that tallies up at the end of each stage . on one end is the psychopath rating , and the other the professional rating , with a "" career criminal "" rating in the middle . your actions count toward one of these overall ratings , which determine the ending you get at the end of the game . given the lousy gameplay , it \' s highly unlikely that anyone will want to play through the game multiple times to see the different endings ; but if nothing else , it won \' t take you very long should you decide to punish yourself this way . the whole game takes only around five to six hours to complete .', ""the game ' s driving sequences use the same system , though it judges you based on the amount of reckless damage you cause , versus more cautious driving . unfortunately , driving cautiously is impossible with driving controls this heinous . cars oversteer ridiculously , violently slipping around a track and making it extremely hard to avoid oncoming traffic and nearby cop cars . sometimes you have to slam into cops to destroy them , but lining them up can be an extreme pain when you can barely keep your car moving straight . the driving courses are also extremely linear , with few shortcuts or jumps to speak of , and a very specific map path that you have to take to get to your objective , so it ' s not like you get to do much in the way of exploration while driving , either ."", ""though reservoir dogs is far from the worst - looking action game you ' ll ever see , it ' s not pleasant to look at . the character models are blurry and don ' t animate very well . it ' s a far cry from what you see in the cutscenes , where the models at least have some detail to them . in - game , they just look awful . environments frequently repeat the same urban settings , even after you ' ve gotten past the heist sections of the story . though some areas look decent , you ' ll frequently see extremely fuzzy textures and set pieces that clearly weren ' t meant for careful examination . when driving , car physics are all over the place . some cars will launch hundreds of feet with a simple tap , while others will stand pat after a hefty bump . the driving camera also has a tendency to go absolutely insane when multiple cops are rubbing up against you , snapping back and forth between top - down and behind - the - car views in a spastic fashion . predictably , the pc version of the game does look better than the xbox and playstation 2 versions , though it also requires a dual - analog gamepad for proper control . you can get by for the most part with a keyboard and mouse , but when you have to direct disarmed cops toward walls and objects to surrender , you have to slide the mouse around to direct their movements , which is a poor substitute for the right analog stick control on the console versions ."", 'even killing indiscriminately is pretty boring .', 'the audio in reservoir dogs is far and away the best thing about it . though michael madsen is the only one of the original dogs to provide a voice and likeness for the film ( and he does a pretty good job with it

of sequel feel a little insubstantial .', 'consequently , you can imagine how happy it makes me to report that toukiden 2 suffers from no such problems . it’s bigger than the first toukiden — and , not coincidentally , also a whole lot better .', 'see , toukiden 2 gives you a nice , big open world to play in . where the first game was based in a hub world and sent you off to various locations to kill x number of monsters , this time out the game gives you freedom to explore . rather than forcing you to play the game in a fairly linear fashion , toukiden 2 sets the scene — as before , you’re stopping a monster invasion — and then sets you loose to play however you wish . there are still quests and missions , but now the game feels a lot freer .', 'and as open worlds go , this one is pretty well done . the monster population is manageable while still being plentiful , and there are enough side quests and secrets to discover that it feels fairly lived - in . it also performs pretty well on the vita : while the landscape is apparently a little sparser than it is in the console version , it never feels like you’re just running around a big , empty space .', 'toukiden 2 is also helped by the fact its combat is so free - flowing . omega force know how to do hack & slash action well thanks to their handling of the various warriors franchises , and that experience comes shining through here . attacking giant monsters is a breeze , and with the addition of demon hand ( where touching a monster on the screen propels you towards them ) , it’s even easier than it was the first time around .', 'i know that a lot of people have already written off the toukiden series as little more than a monster hunter clone . and i get it : you are , after all , hunting monsters . but toukiden 2 shows that just because the formula may be similar , the execution is on a whole other level . it’s a fantastic game , and if you want to hunt monsters in an open world , you don’t need to wait around for monster hunter world — toukiden 2 is already here .', 'no more paying for haircuts ! . . .', 'one of the best yakuza releases gets the kiwami treatment , making for an even better experience on p . . .', 'sony is going to web a lot of consoles and copies of spidey this holiday season . . . .', 'powered by wordpress and the graphene theme .'], ['the original toukiden and its updated 2015 enhanced version toukiden kiwami broke interesting ground in the monster hunting genre . set in a pseudo - japan , the games charged the player with the task of hunting creatures known as oni that had invaded the world . following up with the full sequel toukiden 2 , omega force has expanded on the formula introduced in the original with new weapons , an all - new story , and an expansive open world to explore .', 'toukiden 2 kicks off with a detailed character - creation system . i’m used to a couple dozen hairstyles and a few face types available in most hunting games but toukiden 2 goes the extra mile and includes more options than you could possibly need .', 'it’s once you’ve made your character the game kicks into full gear however , launching you into the middle of a battle in a city torn apart by the long war against the otherworldly oni invaders . after facing a particularly large oni , your character is whisked ten years into the future where they are discovered by a woman who identifies as the professor and her assistant – the machine tokitsugu . the pair bring you back to their home in the outskirts of mahoroba , which is a town both united against the influx of oni appearing in the world and divided within by two factions ; the samurai and the guards .', 'soon after your arrival , you are tasked with becoming the professor’s assistant . she’ll have you testing her experiments , finding mitama , and closing gates to the otherworld that are the source of the oni . the story itself is not very note - worthy , but it mostly serves as a vehicle to have you traversing the world and hunting bigger and bigger oni .', 'toukiden 2 features all nine weapon types featured in the last game , plus the addition two new weapons ; the sword & shield and the chain whip . every single weapon functions differently – from the timing - based , heavy - hitting gauntlets to the strategic , long - distance bullet - reloading rifle . my personal favorite was the chain whip due to its wide area of effect and the ability to launch kunai into the oni , latch onto them , then fly through the air for long combos .', 'although the sheer number of options are intimidating , finding the perfect weapon for your particular play style is easy thanks to a long list of optional tutorials that walk you through all the details and combos of each weapon category . all the weapons and armor sets in the game are very well - designed , which makes crafting new equipment with the parts of slain enemies even more of a reward ; you work toward not only better stats , but also yet another cool look for your character . the game is overall easier than many others in the genre , and this may be a pro or a con for you depending on what you’re looking for .', 'in addition to weapons and armor , the third type of equipment is a bit more interesting . mitama are spirits of deceased warriors , and are found by completing missions – or as rare drops from certain large oni . 200 of them exist in the game , and provide varying functions . these range from healing , to attack boosts ; depending on whether you equip them in your attack , defense , or support slot .', 'perhaps the most notable addition to the game – as well as the hunting genre overall – is the demon hand . an invention from the professor , it provides a number of very useful functions . as you weaken enemies with your attacks you can view them with your demon eye to see which of their appendages have taken enough damage to be easily broken . after using the vita’s touch screen to aim the trajectory of your demon hand toward a chosen weak point , it lunges forward ; grabbing the part and yanking it off of the oni’s body .', 'the demon hand can also be used for quick travel by targeting part of an oni that hasn’t been weakened enough yet . instead of ripping off the part , you will instead be rapidly pulled to its body – allowing for strategic acrobatics to become a part of your arsenal of attack types .', 'thankfully , the large open world is also a perfect place in which to use the demon hand . rather than the instanced missions used by most hunting games , the story of toukiden 2 takes place in a seamless map filled with oni both large and small . there are occasional encampments that allow you to teleport to mahoroba and back ( should you not want to make the trek back on your own ) , but there are no other hub cities to discover .', 'by touching trees or certain cliffs with your demon hand however , you’ll see that you can swing between trees and climb up steep edges with ease . the hand can also be used to decimate large piles of rubble that block your way . should the demon hand not be your choice method of travel , you can also walk , run , or dash across the map . the first two options allow unlimited use , but dashing does deplete your stamina meter when it’s used . luckily , stamina regenerates quickly .', 'the map itself is composed of a series of regions called “ages ; ” each of which represent different eras in the game’s history , as well as different environmental types . i must say , really appreciated the variety in the open world ( as well as the switch - up from traditional pre - selected missions ) .', 'if you enjoyed the mission - based gameplay in previous entries in the genre , don’t fret ! there are still a number of missions that are unlocked as you go through the story . some of them only require you to slay a particular enemy or group of enemies , while others will see you delving into an underground maze to see how deep you can make it .', 'many of these missions are found in the game’s multiplayer mode , which is easily accessed . that said , the missions can be played solo , with npcs , via ad - hoc , or via online – the last of which includes cross - play with the playstation 4 version of the game . there’s almost always at least one room going , and playing missions online is a lot of fun so i highly recommend it . should you not have access to an internet connection however – or if you simply want to play the entire game solo , every piece of multiplayer content is also doable with just the game’s npcs so you won’t miss out on a single thing .', 'the music in the game is largely inspired by traditional japanese music and heavily features flutes and string instruments . it’s beautiful to listen to , but probably not something that will make you want to rush out and buy the soundtrack . sound effects are spot - on though – and oni roars , weapon slashes , rifle shots , and the characters calling out to each other create a wonderfully chaotic cacophony in each battle .', 'it’s important to note here that while voiced , the game only has the original japanese dub available . on one hand this is great , since the original dub is fantastic and includes a large number of voiced scenes . on the other , the characters often speak while walking through the map or fighting and no subtitles are provided during these scenes . i’m sure it’s just typical flavor text like “let’s do our best” and things along those lines , but it still would have been nice for subtitles to be included here – especially since they’re present in the game’s cg cutscenes .', 'looking at the game as a whole , it’s true that the playstation 4 version features improved graphics and a better frame rate , but the vita is absolutely no slouch . it usually runs at a solid thirty frames per second , though occasional dips will happen . i found that playing the playstation 4 version might be more comfortable however , particularly with regards to demon hand use . taking my hand off of the action buttons and having to cover the screen with a finger to target an oni during the heat of battle wasn’t exactly ideal , especially when i knew the playstation 4 version controlled the demon hand with the r2 shoulder button . despite these minor complaints however , the vita version is absolutely not a poor version of the game and it’s stellar that the developers managed to squeeze everything into it .', 'toukiden 2 is an absolutely massive game with a large number of game systems both large and small . whether you come looking for a solid story with great gameplay , an entry point into the hunting genre , or online gameplay with others , there is a lot of game to dig into – and it’s all wrapped in a beautiful , portable package . it ranks among the top of the genre , and that’s saying something if you ask me .', ""toukiden 2 - like most games in the hunting genre - is filled to the brim with content . featuring tons of equipment to craft , mitama to collect , and quests to complete , it easily ranks among the top of the genre . plus , it certainly doesn ' t hurt that while it ' s easy enough that newcomers can pick it up , it can also provide enough challenge to entertain genre veterans ."", ""ethan ' s favorite game genres include jrpgs , visual novels , rhythm , and fighting . he primarily plays on handheld systems ."", 'nice review ! meanwhile i still didn’t play the first game ( which i own for months now ) .', 'good review . i played it on the ps tv primarily and it used r2 for the demon hand as well . one thing i wish the game did was have all the talking be finished before the start of battle because i could not always focus on the words while trying to dodge attacks from oni . like leave me alone , chthonian fiend i’m trying to read and listen to this heartfelt moment between my crew . ah the pains of subs vs dubs . other than that and the roaming subtitles pet peeve i absolutely loved the main story .', 'i started playing this last week on a business trip , and it’s really great . excellent release for the vita !', 'we use our own and third party cookies . if you continue browsing we consider you accept the use of cookies .'], ['on paper there isn’t a whole lot thoroughly unique about toukiden 2 . it’s an action rpg with pre - 20th century japanese stylings , focused on demon hunting , crafting , item and gear collecting , and exploring . despite this , it also has a lot going for it ; it’s the third game in the toukiden series , with the opportunity to refine a formula that has proven popular . it has an intriguing plot , lovely character art , and for the first time in the series , an open world . i reviewed the game on vita , and was met with both a bevy of pleasant surprises and a handful of clear setbacks . though the ratio of both wavered , i did ultimately have fun .', 'if there’s an area where toukiden 2 doesn’t skimp , it’s pre - prepared cutscenes . i can’t speak to the graphical impressiveness of these on ps4 , but on vita they struck me as highly cinematic and effective at stage - setting . the game opens with a cutscene portraying a cataclysmic demon attack called the “awakening , ” is followed by a quick tutorial , and then drops the player straight into a souls - meets - xcx character creation tool . the default character name is "" slayer , "" but it felt a bit generic to me . i renamed myself "" fantomas "" which , like slayer , is also the name of a band dave lombardo plays in .', 'what struck me immediately was the amount of plot and text in the game ; i’ll be the first to admit i did not expect this from dynasty warriors developer omega force , not even in an rpg . unfortunately , though not unbearable by any stretch , toukiden ’s writing and character dialogue won’t be winning any awards . important story characters are unreasonably long winded , while npcs in the world are just the opposite , issuing abrupt testimony with often little context or further conversation . still , certain members of the cast are endearing , and getting used to them is necessary – they become your party members in battle shortly after their respective spiels .', 'as you might expect , the meat and potatoes of toukiden are combat and preparation for combat , and once set free into the game’s open world it’s essentially up to the player to develop a style and penchant for certain weapon types or gear sets . the game offers a vast selection of weapon types , including swords , knives , spears , gauntlets , chain & sickle , bows , clubs , naginatas , sword and shield combo , chain whips , and yes , even rifles , so if you had fears about being bored or under - challenged , quell them . all weapon types are available to try from the start ( i immediately selected gauntlets because i like crushing things ) , and can be replaced or improved via shops and blacksmiths found in the game . a number next to each weapon denotes weapon class ; a similar number denotes item scarcity , which implies value or lack thereof .', 'while i appreciate the extensive variety , combat itself had me wondering why investment was put toward so many weapon types and , well , not more actual fighting variety instead . bouts are handled via a fight pallette explained early on ; weapon sets have “attack 1 , ” “attack 2 , ” a special move that can be charged ( or executed continuously by pressing circle over and over ) , as well as a combo attack designed specifically for busting - up enemy appendages . just as it is in xenoblade chronicles x , targeting and destroying appendages is a compelling mechanic that heightens gamification and provides mid - fight continuous objectives that , for the most part , prevent you from noticing that button - mashing does in fact work .', 'a big addition to toukiden 2 is the demon hand capability , a combat technique invented by the game’s lithe professor character and controlled via the touchscreen on vita . demon hand is probably my favorite aspect of combat ; initially it’s used to simply obliterate foes via anomalous taps , but it also serves as a mode of near - field transportation ( yanking your slayer toward enemies ) and develops expanded function as you progress through the game . any lack of depth i felt about the combat early on was lessened as i began executing button - press , combo , and screen - taps in continuous flow , to the point that i suspect the ps4 edition may be missing out sans the added variety of controlling the game this way . i wasn’t able to test outside of my vita copy this time however , so it’s just a hunch .', 'beyond what i’ve already covered , toukiden 2 is more about developing a sense of time and place than i expected , and though it does come up short in some ways , it excels in others . a clear highlight for me is the game’s character art ; detailed , hand - drawn portrayals of the fine folk met throughout general hub mahoroba village and beyond accompany most textboxes , and add tangible personality and engrossment to polygonal graphics that can often come off as drab . the soundtrack is also pleasant ; neither face - melting or tear - inducing , it captures the feeling of the time in which the game is set , and calls the right amount of attention to itself . i likely won’t add it to my itunes library , but within the context of the game , it does its job well .', 'unfortunately for me deep captivation ends there , and though i admire the ambition to go open - world , toukiden 2 ’s graphics , animations , and layout had me wondering why doing so was so necessary . animations in particular often look stiff to the point of being slightly comedic , and there’s just something about the way my custom slayer fantomas glides across terrain at a single on / off speed that , to me , doesn \' t sit quite right . thankfully battle animations are better , and i’ll admit that when i focused on strengths like character art , music , and some of the writing , the open - world component resonated more and i actually didn’t mind the sometimes - aimless exploring . it’s also up for debate what is even considered "" open world "" these days , but toukiden 2 ’s promotional materials have embraced the term , and all things considered i do think it’s warranted .', 'toukiden 2 is without question a fun game , but so is dynasty warriors . my ultimate takeaway is that omega force has touched on some pleasant rpg charm and exploration of world and character here , but perhaps hasn’t gone far enough ; instead , the game flirts with such elements before falling back on familiarity .', 'still , if you’re a combat junkie you’ll enjoy the game , and between the many weapon types , new demon hand capability , and return of mitama spells and buffs , you’re unlikely to get bored even if the level of complexity doesn’t exactly match up with what you seek . if you’re in it for what omega force does well , then you likely already know you want the game . otherwise , toukiden 2 is a fun diversion that is generally outclassed by its open -

length in podcasts and other public forums before , and in a way curse of osiris is the epitome of this ongoing issue . the expansion treats its characters , setting , and plot developments as disposable things , to be discarded once they’ve served their purpose in the immediate present . doing so not only harms the long term story that destiny 2 provides to players , but actually negatively impacts this expansion by feeling overwhelmingly meaningless . the “curse” in curse of osiris seems to be that bungie refuses to allow their own stories have a purpose or impact on their game , and it’s something players ( including myself ) will continue to criticize until bungie gives players an ongoing enemy , objective , or direction .', 'it’s such a missed opportunity , because curse of osiris has some stellar new characters ( e . g . sagira ) , and badass villain ( i . e . panoptes ) , and plays with some really interesting concepts that could have much broader implications than bungie allowed . after making such a fuss about osiris’ return from exile , he simply wanders off at the end of the campaign without much of an explanation . instead of delving into the vex’s plans and taking time to tell that story , a lot of the campaign feels like filler , even going so far as to include both of the new strikes in the campaign itself instead of using that time to flesh out the narrative . and in the endgame , instead of expanding upon their barebones story with additional story - focused encounters , they give us missions that have us going back into the vex’s simulation machine and fighting against simulated enemies , which is essentially meaningless busywork inside of a fake reality that doesn’t matter much at all . the result is something that feels like bungie tried their hardest to make curse of osiris have as little of an impact as possible , which is a huge departure from destiny 2’s vanilla campaign where they killed off almost all the guardians and destroyed half of a planet .', 'the new patrol zone of mercury is equally disappointing , as the entire landscape essentially amounts to a large circle . though it’s quite a beautiful circle , there is sadly very little to do . there are a few hidden chests , one lost sector , and a lighthouse to hang out in , but beyond that you’ll find yourself quite literally walking in circles . the exception here is the excellent new public event , which was designed with the space in mind , and is the most complex and entertaining public event to - date . once you’ve run it a few times though , you’ll have little reason to return . you aren’t allowed to enter the infinite forest without a specific purpose , which so far only includes the campaign , the strikes , and the adventures . those encounters are great , but brief , like everything in this expansion , and mercury’s patrol space quickly becomes a spent force .', 'as i mentioned , the two new strikes are included as a part of the campaign , and i can’t understate enough how thoroughly awful this decision feels . most players will go into the strike playlist as they have in the past , expecting unique little slices of story and a unique boss fight at the end , only to discover regurgitated content from the campaign . the truth is , i don’t know how i would have felt about these strikes had they not been included in the campaign . chances are i would have favored them much more highly , but because i first played the campaign and went into the strikes expecting something fresh i can’t really evaluate these missions fairly . their presence as a redundancy takes the wind out of the sails that probably could have improved this expansion markedly .', 'curse of osiris also adds a system whereby players can forge unique osiris - themed weapons , a prospect that excited me when it was first revealed . unfortunately the process by which players forge these weapons requires one to grind public events and other activities over and over again until you gain enough materials to craft your weapon . it’s another massive opportunity missed , especially since players have been bemoaning the lack of meaningful endgame content . the forged weapon system seems like a last - ditch effort to artificially expand the endgame loop for destiny’s most hardcore players . the problem is that this system isn’t fun . grinding the same strikes and public events over and over again to get a single weapon that isn’t even especially powerful is a pain in the ass that i can’t imagine any players enjoying .', 'yet another issue that i have with curse of osiris lies in the deployment model for the content itself . the expansion runs players $ 20 , which isn’t a huge asking price , but in the larger context of destiny’s economy feels like a huge slap in the face . players not only are expected to purchase the base game and buy additional expansions , but must also put up with highly annoying platform - exclusive content and the growing presence of microtransactions . for those keeping score at home that’s four sources of revenue that are , one way or another , coming at the player’s expense . and with all that , players who don’t pay for the expansion lose access to certain endgame activities and are limited to separate playlists from those who bought the expansion . it might not be a big deal this early in the game with destiny 2 , but if things continue this way , the community will continually fragment until it reaches a comical state of affairs . how many playlists will there be when expansion number two comes out ? how much of the new content will be locked behind microtransactions and loot boxes ? how many pieces of content will be exclusive to a single platform ?', 'all of these issues could very well culminate in a slow death for destiny . the truth is that if bungie doesn’t want to fragment their community , they need to think about providing the expansions to players for free and supporting that with the other three ways they’re getting money from their players . alternatively , they could do away with microtransactions and put more of that content into the expansions that they’re expecting players to pay for , which might make that content more worth the asking price in the eyes of their fanbase . the bottom line is that the model upon which destiny 2 is being built is problematic at best and broken at worst . players can’t be expected to buy a game for $ 60 that locks a good portion of the community out of content via platform exclusivity , then locks even more content behind a microtransaction / loot box model , then asks them to buy expansions every 3 months as well , or lose content that they had access to previously . if destiny 2 wants to be a game - as - a - service , then it needs to be a deal that is fair to players and creates a sustainable model for the community . the deal that players are being given now isn’t fair or sustainable — not even close .', 'the crucible situation in curse of osiris is a bit of a mixed bag . since the launch of destiny 2 , players have felt that something was a bit off about the game’s pvp mode . complaints include : guardians aren’t as powerful , super abilities aren’t game changers , team - shooting is the only mechanic that matters . to be honest , there are a lot of points in the community that i don’t necessarily agree with . i think that some of destiny 1’s more random and imbalanced design choices were bugs , not features . but regardless of my opinion or the community’s stance of this , curse of osiris does nothing to address any of these issues , and that’s a problem . the two new crucible maps ( 3 on ps4 ) are a lot of fun , but they aren’t game changers . they don’t solve or improve any of the issues with crucible . they don’t even add a new game mode to destiny , as many past expansions have . they just shovel a few more maps into the game as if that will make players more excited to play a mode that most of the community seems to dislike .', 'and oddly enough , one accidental change seems to have addressed all of these issues . when curse of osiris shipped , it shipped with a bugged weapon called prometheus lens . the gun shoots a laser that does more damage the longer you’re able to train it on your opponent , but also unintentionally does damage over time . the weapon’s bug is so egregious that enemies can be killed in just over a second without much effort , making it the only choice for anyone wanting to be competitive . and when xur sold this weapon on friday , and the entire community go ahold of it , this bugged weapon made crucible more enjoyable than it’s been for me since the game’s launch . it’s stupidly - overpowered , and has no place in the game’s meta , but somehow its existence adds a layer of randomness and challenge that it puts a smile on my face . perhaps it’s a bad sign that a broken weapon improved my pvp experience in destiny . perhaps this validates the destiny community’s complaints that crucible has become too dull and predictable . i’ll leave that for the community and bungie to debate , but for now this bugged weapon goes into the “pros” column in my evaluation of this expansion .', 'now that i’ve ranted and raved about many issues i had with destiny 2 : curse of osiris , i want to highlight its single biggest saving grace : the all - new raid content . the expansion upon the leviathan raid , entitled “the world - eater , ” is unlike anything in destiny before . although it’s shorter than most raids before it , it’s challenging , unique , and highly enjoyable . the basic idea for the raid expansion , which bungie has dubbed “raid lairs , ” is that we’ll get a shorter , but equally challenging raid experience that expands upon the base raid that came before it . before this content’s release a lot of the community ( myself included ) was expecting something very minor that utilized the same space of the base raid , but we could not have been more wrong . instead the raid lair offers all - new areas to explore , epic puzzles to overcome , and one massive , challenging boss fight to tie it all up . the fact that it was a bite - sized version of a raid didn’t hamper my experience at all — in fact i was happy to have a raid experience that didn’t take a good chunk of my day to complete . a lot of things in curse of osiris disappointed me , but the world - eater reminded me why i put up with that stuff and continue to play destiny .', 'finally , it wouldn’t be fair for me to end my review without gushing about how great destiny looks and sounds . curse of osiris has its own original soundtrack , unique sound design for guns , and is the first time that players on console can enjoy 4k and hdr . the game looks and sounds better than it ever has , and this isn’t an accomplishment that shouldn’t be overlooked , despite the other outstanding issues i might have with the expansion .', 'destiny 2 : curse of osiris has an excellent new raid and an interesting campaign , but is severely lacking in meaningful content and plagued by a host of larger issues that have yet to be addressed .', 'you know that jerk online that relentlessly trash talks you after every kill ? that guy was probably travis "" tie guy "" northup . competitive , snarky , and constantly wearing a tie -

15 hours of the campaign were reasonably satisfying in the base game .', 'curse of osiris , on the other hand , had a lame campaign . you head to mercury because someone brought ikora osiris’s ghost , sagira . osiris has been on mercury for an incredibly long time investigating a vex machine called the infinite forest which can simulate a massive amount of probability variations . the vex are using it to attempt to figure out the sequence of events that will result in them conquering the universe and converting it to a form that can’t sustain other forms of life .', 'osiris’s introduction is anti - climatic . we’ve heard about how powerful and impressive he is in the destiny lore before , and it seemed like he’d actually play a big part in the expansion since it’s named after him . like all the other big - shot guardians though , he’s just there to be a deus ex machina when you need one . also , once again our voiceless guardian is somehow more powerful , and resourceful than the strongest beings our solar system has ever known , and osiris looks utterly ineffectual by the end of the campaign .', 'unlike ghaul , vex axis mind panoptes , infinite mind , the main antagonist of curse of osiris , doesn’t even speak to you at all . it just shows up a few times through the campaign to be menacing . also , no one was ever actively in danger of being killed by the vex . the vex had figured out the probabilities that would have to occur to conquer the universe , but no one ever said how far in the future it would happen . the future events that you’re trying to prevent might happen millions of years from the time you’re in . you could likely go chill for a thousand years or more and then come back and see what’s up .', 'the campaign also commits the sin of reusing a ridiculous amount of assets . seeing a lot of familiar assets is to be expected in an expansion , but in curse of osiris , it just seems lazy . out of the eight missions that make up the campaign , three of them take you back to areas you’ve already explored in the base game . if it made any sense , i would buy it , but there’s no reason for a cult of osiris secret temple to suddenly be just off maevic square in the edz other than bungie didn’t feel like making new areas .', 'mercury is a joke . if you were expecting a world that was even the size of titan or io , then you’re going to be bummed out . mercury is about the size of a battlefield 1 map . i haven’t sat down and mapped it out , but it’s likely the larger regions of the edz and nessus are more expansive than all of the new area introduced in curse of osiris . once you beat the campaign and any current challenges , the only reason to come back to mercury is to do a few side quests and grind for mercury tokens .', 'mercury also happens to be the least aesthetically pleasing planet in destiny 2 . it’s just a bunch of sand colored stone buildings and dirt . the infinite forest , where the other five missions take place , looks interesting but is boring in execution . each of these five missions involves jumping from moss - covered stone platform to moss - covered stone platform and killing enemies so you can make it to a portal that you can go through so you can do it again .', 'there aren’t even any new enemy types outside of the few bosses introduced for the vex . also , since the infinite forest can generate simulations of realities , it gave bungie the excuse to just spawn random cabal and fallen in addition to vex enemies . there’s an in -

game content for those that do not own the expansion . this also means that some achievements cannot be obtained ( unless unlocked already ) if you do not own the new content . bungie have stated that they will look into ways at getting the achievement issue addressed , but nothing has been mentioned regarding the blocked content . poor form bungie , poor form . on the topic of achievements , this expansion brings no new ones with it .', 'the new story campaign is hardly something i would class as a campaign . when i say the word campaign , it instils the thought of something padded , lengthy and inviting . curse of osiris is neither of those . oded fehr is introduced as the voice of osiris and manages to deliver a solid performance alongside the rest of the cast . his female ghost sagira is voiced by ( yet another firefly crew member ) morena baccarin , who much like oded fehr , brings a unique personality to the fold . the problem with the curse of osiris isn’t with the concept , nor with how it’s delivered , the problem lies wholly with the volume of content . any fan of destiny will know first hand how cheap bungie can be when it comes to reusing old content and this new dlc is a prime example of that . i mean here we sit four years since the launch of destiny , yet we still have just four races to fight against – vex , fallen , cabal , and hive . no , i do not class taken as a new race . sure , we have different variants of races to tackle but it would be nice to aim down my sights and see something completely fresh . unfortunately curse of osiris doesn’t offer anything new to blast to smithereens outside of different variations of the same races we’ve been slamming for years now .', 'mercury as a location is intriguing at first glance and upon your initial traversal of the interesting environment , it’s hard not to fall in love with what’s on offer . that however is as short - lived as the story itself . there’s only a single lost sector and a single public event , that’s how small it is . furthermore there’s only three adventures and eight story missions , a handful of which take place on edz , io , and nessus . the most alluring moments in this expansion are underused , such as travelling through time and witnessing a past mercury timeline . bungie really dropped the ball with this expansion , because the vex are by far the most interesting enemies present . group that with the ability to travel through time to witness the same location at different points in its life , and one has to wonder why this whole idea wasn’t withheld for a bulkier ‘the taken king’ sized content drop . osiris has been on mercury all of this time investigating the vex , who are using technology in an attempt to suss out which timeline would see them dominate the universe . it’s an excellent story setup that’s let down by its length , design repetition , and lack of impact .', 'osiris has been beefed up to be some all powerful guardian , yet much of the fighting is done by the player alone , who once again remains without a voice . it just doesn’t add up in the grand scheme of things . i wont spoil the story for you but i would caution you not to blink , because you might miss it . it doesn’t help that the map size and content quality of this new location is meagre . i remember my first visit to the vex - run vault of glass . i was filled with awe and wonder as i dug deeper into the vault to meet its depths and uncover its secrets . my time on mercury has been interesting but not compelling , and certainly not as fascinating as that comparison . you can nuke everything that’s included in this expansion within six hours , everything . even the new raid lair is said to last only 30 minutes in total on a good run – despite holding some interesting twists . the infinite forest is another interesting concept that seems fascinating but ultimately falls flat . accessed via a gateway in the fields of glass , the infinite forest is the aforementioned reality simulation used by the vex to map every possible outcome in the universe . these realities are overseen by panoptes , a huge assed hydra and the main antagonist of curse of osiris . whilst it is indeed interesting to witness different time loops of the same area , it’s not padded out enough to keep you entertained .', 'the infinite forest would have been a spectacular location for a vex - based raid , but with the rest of curse of osiris , bungie fails to deliver . the difficulty is another downside to this expansion , being that it’s almost non - existent . i may well have died a bunch of times playing the new content , but much of that was down to player error rather than actual tough gameplay . bungie really needs to work out that it’s okay to challenge their players , it’s okay to make something tougher than it should be , it’s okay to craft something that makes fans feel rewarded for overcoming said hardship . curse of osiris seems to dance on the line between doable and simple and i’m not okay with that , i’m not okay with just going through the motions . i haven’t been this disappointed with a destiny content drop since paying a visit to the prison of elders in the house of wolves . this feels more like something that could have been chopped up and thrown into the game for free . remember the live team that were responsible for eververse and promised to throw in free content as long as people purchased her goods ? yes , those people ! i would expect much of this content from them , wherever the hell they’ve gone , i wouldn’t expect this from a £17 . 19 / $ 19 . 99 expansion .', 'destiny 2 : curse of osiris is a waste of both money and time . it’s a shame that bungie couldn’t use the infinite forest themselves to find a timeline in which they had actually crafted a content drop that was as interesting and innovative in practice as it was on paper . curse of osiris does house some solid elements , such as decent voice acting and gorgeous design , but that means absolutely nothing when the content itself is meagre and half - baked . there’s far too much asset recycling going on in this new content to consider calling it fresh , and far too little execution to consider calling it worthy of its steep cost . i imagine die hard destiny fans will appreciate the small band of new activities and gear , but for those that were hoping for something more like the taken king , you’re going to be sorely disappointed . it’s a shame really , because activision and bungie promised better dlc for the sequel , and if this is a sign of things to come , i worry for the long term of destiny 2 . my best advice would be to avoid this until it falls in price .', 'this game was tested and reviewed on xbox one . all of the opinions and insights here are subject to that version .', 'want to keep up to date with the latest xt reviews , xt opinions and xt content ? follow us on facebook , twitter , and youtube .', 'good art design in the new locations .', 'decent voice acting despite the silent protagonist .', 'short , dull and uninteresting story .', 'far too much recycled content to be considered new .', 'not enough variety in the content .', 'locks vanilla players out of a lot of content .', 'certainly not worth the asking price .', ""i ' ve been playing games for as long as i can care to remember . here at xbox tavern , i write news , reviews , previews and more . i ' m a long time final fantasy fan , i can camp like you ' ve never seen before in most fps , and if i ' m on a racing game , i tend to purposely trade paint . feel free to add me -

on review of the game . i enjoyed my time with the game as it reminded me a lot of minecraft , of which i had played a bit of the wii u version , but that was it . at the time , i created a mage in portal knights because i gravitate towards spellcasters in role - playing games . i’m not saying that was a mistake on my part , but as someone playing the game for the first time , maybe going with the traditionally squishy class wasn’t the best choice . now it’s almost two years later and i received the opportunity to review the nintendo switch version , so let’s see how this plays out now that i have an idea of what i’m doing .', 'when you first start , you can choose from play online , play offline , and local multiplayer . the first and third options allow you to take one of your characters and either host a game in one of your worlds or join in someone else’s world . the second option is essentially single - player . sadly , i don’t have any friends with this game yet , and , believe it or not , i couldn’t find any games to join at the time of this review—so i couldn’t really check out the multiplayer options .', 'when starting a single - player game you’ll create your character and name your world . you can have up to five characters and three worlds stored , and the worlds are all randomly generated so you’ll never get the exact same world twice . in addition , you can choose whether to have a small or large world size . for my world i went with a large size . the island sizes are pretty big with plenty to explore…and the occasional mini - island out in the air that you’ll have to build your way to if you want to explore it . your knight can be one of three classes : warrior , ranger , or mage , each with their own methods of attacks such as swords , bows , and wands . after that you’re plopped down in the first randomly generated island and your adventure begins .', 'the goal of each island is to find a portal , of which there is at least one in each area , and fill the portal with the required number of certain - colored blocks to proceed to the next island . from here a lot of the game is similar to minecraft as you can gather various things and turn them into useful tools and items via a crafting table or furnace . you’ll also find various enemies wandering around with some tougher enemies appearing at night . there are also quests you can complete that , along with defeating enemies and while mining , can earn you experience . after obtaining a certain amount of experience you’ll level up and will have a couple of points you can put into various attributes such as strength , constitution , and agility . naturally you’ll want to put points into attributes that play to your class’s strengths .', 'as stated , there’s a huge minecraft - style element to the game in that you can mine just about anything you see that’s not an enemy . if you’re like me , you’ll want to mine just about everything you can find . even random blocks of dirt have their uses . when i first played the steam version in early access , i didn’t do a whole lot of mining other than giving myself a few basics to start with ; i just ran around the island , found the portal , and once i had enough energy shards of the correct color , i’d create enough blocks to fill the portal and move on . sure , i had enemies to deal with that grew stronger the further into the game i went , but i was a more interested in seeing the next island and discovering new things to mine . if you actually try that now you’ll likely hit a brick wall…hard . after getting a few islands in , i started coming across more difficult enemies . it was then that i learned that crafting is very important . don’t get me wrong , i knew it was to begin with , but i spent a lot more time crafting items in the early going this time around than i did on the steam version . keep in mind that any tools you craft , such as weapons , axes , picks , and so on , will have durability that will degrade over time . when it runs out you can still use the item ( and repair them using a sharpening stone ) , but it’ll only be half as effective .', 'each island has a landing portal . you can backtrack to any island you’ve previously been to with these portals . you can also set any island to be your home . tapping the home button on the map will transport you to that specific island without having to find it on the map . since the maps are randomly generated for each world you create , this may not always be the case 100 percent of the time , but my first island had a small house with a small garden next to it . i basically ended up making that house my home in the world and crafted a few things such as a furnace , drafting table , and an anvil to make more items with . then i spent several hours just gathering various materials from the islands i had been to at that point to prepare me for what lies ahead . one of my biggest personal issues with minecraft was just not knowing what i needed in order to make certain items , or how to arrange them in the crafting window properly . here , not only can you see all available items , but you can craft what items you need to craft your final item . you can see on the map screen the materials you can mine from that island . early on , when i needed a bunch of copper to make things , i knew i could go to level 1 - 02 to find the copper ore that i needed .', 'i mentioned that all islands have at least one portal you can activate , while some have multiple portals . i also mentioned that you’ll occasionally come across some quests you can do for rewards and experience . these can actually go hand in hand . if you look at the map you can see lines where various islands connect to each other and you’ll also see an island that has a skull on it . that’s a boss and you have to basically find your way around the islands to make a path to get to that boss island . along the way though you’ll come across boss - related quests . one of the first ones i had was in level 1 - 04 and i ultimately got a green orb that has a boss key icon in the upper - left corner ( the island has a giant key on it on the map screen to let you know that island is kind of important ) . now that i had this item i needed to make my way to the boss , which didn’t seem too difficult of a task , but it’s all about finding the correct portals to get to where you need to go ; and with everything being randomly generated , it means that you’ll never have the same world twice .', ""i’ve enjoyed my time with portal knights on the switch , but is there anything that i didn’t like ? well , sort of . i kind of already mentioned the first thing , that early on i hit a brick wall where i had to stop , gather a bunch of materials , and craft new items to help with my survival . i do get that a lot of the game is mining and crafting , but only a few islands in i had to start working towards crafting new gear outside of what i already had on ( in my case , the squire clothing used for a warrior ) as well as a new copper long sword as enemies were getting tougher . it also doesn’t help that even on the earlier islands enemies will gang up on you . if you chose to play as a warrior and have to get up close to defeat your enemies , you’ll have to master how to dodge enemy attacks to survive . this is complicated further when you have multiple enemies to contend with , and if it’s dark out at the time , it makes enemies harder to see without a good light source . the other main issue i have is somewhat of a nitpick , and that’s the load times , specifically when traveling between islands . whether you’re using a portal to travel or choosing a location on the map , it takes at least 20 seconds or so , if not more , for the next area to load . granted , i get that it is generating a random island , so i understand why it takes that long . that ' s why it’s just a minor nitpick from me . but it does kind of slow things down . not enough to completely take me out of the game or anything ."", 'the final nitpick is that since this is on a console and you’re using a controller , it can sometimes be a bit difficult to mine or place something exactly where you want to . when placing or mining something you’ll see an outline of a blue block in front of you . that shows where the item will be placed or where you’ll start mining at , no matter which way you’re facing . in other words , the targeting reticle , for lack of a better term here , moves with the camera , not with you . i’ve had many times where i wanted to mine what was in front of me but move the camera to a better position , only to have my character suddenly turn around and start mining where i’m pointing the camera . i get why this happens and it doesn’t take long to get used to . plus it’s a bit easier in first - person mode ( click the thumb stick on the right joy - con ) since moving the camera also turns you . again , just a minor nitpick .', 'overall , i enjoyed my time with portal knights on the nintendo switch . it did take a small bit of time adjusting to the controls since i was used to using a mouse and keyboard on steam . even now i’ll still use l and r when i meant to hit zl or zr , but it didn’t take long to adapt to the joy - cons . the game does seem a bit tougher when playing as a warrior since you won’t have any ranged attacks . that basically means you’ll likely have to spend even more time grinding up materials to craft better gear for yourself . i’m okay with that though as it does kind of present more of a challenge . if you enjoy games like minecraft and are looking for something similar , portal knights is a good one to check out .', ""portal knights on the switch is a really enjoyable game outside of a few minor nitpicks . it can be a tad frustrating to have to constantly mine materials for new gear in the very early going . but much like minecraft , a lot of the game is mining and exploring . if you take your time and enjoy every aspect of the game , you ' ll likely enjoy portal knights a lot more than if you just try to rush through each randomly generated island ."", '* the product in this article was sent to us by the developer / company .', ""i began my lifelong love of gaming at an early age with my parent ' s atari 2600 . living in the small town that i did arcades were pretty much non -

like elements ; your character can be one of three classes ( warrior , ranger , or mage ) and you gain experience points by exploring mines or defeating monsters . these experience points can be used to upgrade certain skills which will improve your combat and exploration , and you’ll also level up throughout , providing you with extra class - specific skills to help with your chosen play - style .', 'it is a strange blend in a way , as spending lots of your time and energy building can feel a little pointless – you’ll soon be moving on to a new world and leaving your current one behind . if you look at it as a nice additional feature , though , it makes a little more sense . the crafting of items to use on your adventure , the harvesting of the materials to do so , and the combat itself all work really nicely , and you’ll likely have a great time exploring the worlds that already exist before you , rather than trying to build features of your own .', 'as well as each world containing various monsters for you to either defeat or run away from , you are occasionally thrown in front of giant bosses with a successful battle being required to progress . enemies in the game get tougher and tougher as time goes on and , in some cases , they can feel pretty overwhelming . dying from these fights doesn’t cause any issues or loss of progress , but it can feel a little frustrating if you are underpowered . to combat this , you’ll likely find yourself doing quite a bit of grinding to gain experience , or searching across the worlds you’ve unlocked for specific materials that can bring you some higher quality armour and weapons , especially if you are playing alone .', 'you see , portal knights can either be played completely by yourself , with one other person in local split - screen co - op , or with up to three other players online , and players can drop in and out as they please . the tasks you’ll be completing are the same in every case , but taking on tricky enemies altogether from various angles feels a lot less daunting than going it alone .', 'it isn’t just battles that are shared , though . every aspect becomes a joint adventure if you team up , meaning that your tasks , rewards and – essentially – the availability of crafting items and supplies from the world you are exploring must be shared between the group . in some ways , playing alone is a much tougher experience as you’ll have to figure everything out yourself and spend an awful lot of time working towards the harder fights . on the flipside to this , though , playing alone means that you have full control over each world and the materials within , therefore allowing you to create the strongest character possible to suit your needs .', 'a combination of the pleasing art - style and incredibly extensive menus and crafting options ( which do take some getting used to ) give portal knights that addictive quality that can result in long hours disappearing without you even realising . we’ve spent many hours simply exploring each new world as we arrive , discovering new materials and mining deep underground to discover exciting , secret treasures . if you have the time to lose yourself in exploration , and especially if you have a friend ( or three ) that is just as enthusiastic about the game as you , there is every possibility that you’ll find yourself craving more time with the game each time you turn it off .', 'the switch version of the game offers touchscreen controls should you wish to play the game in handheld mode ( which plays just as well as on the tv ) , but this is strangely slightly limited ; you can use it to cycle through menus and even use your weapons and tools , but you’ll still have to make use of the control stick to aim where your tool will interact with the world , rather than just tapping the block you wish to break open . that , and some pretty lengthy load times when you are travelling between worlds , are the only real faults we found in terms of the game’s execution , though . for the most part ( when you have familiarised yourself with the slightly crazy menus ) , everything runs very smoothly indeed .', 'portal knights has been designed in such a way that encourages co - operative play ; sharing the fun of exploring the worlds and discovering new things together is undoubtedly one of the game’s largest selling points . if you would rather play the game alone , though , there is nothing stopping you from doing so and you’ll still find that there is an enjoyable adventure to be had ( albeit with a slightly different focus on how to go about completing tasks ) .', 'sitting somewhere between the minecraft - type gameplay of building and exploring , and the rpg - like features of crafting , battling , and upgrading your character’s skills and abilities , portal knights feels like it would most suit families , friends or even distant friends online , who wish to explore either of these genres of gaming together in a sometimes challenging - but usually charming - package .', 'ryan’s that annoying kind of guy in multiplayer games - you know the one , the kind of person that throws a temper tantrum if he can’t be yoshi in mario kart or gets stuck with the controller with the dodgy button . yeah , that kind .', 'looks good , may pick up eventually .', ""woohoo . . . ! ! ! i can ' t wait to buy the e -

pad studio’s switch release . in a lot of ways , i’m glad i waited to play this version . with the vita slowly moving behind for many indie developers , it is good to see the switch have almost no trouble taking over as the go to for portable indie games with almost no compromises . owlboy was already worth playing and now even more people can enjoy it . they also fixed the icon that was seemingly a mistake prior to release for the people who pre - ordered and preloaded it .', 'originally released on ios , android and pc platforms .', 'given the switch has a nice capacitive touch screen , there have been many mobile games making the jump to nintendo’s new handheld . atomik : rungunjumpgun originally released on pc and mobile platforms is a hard as nails platformer with simple controls and a very trippy aesthetic . there is even a hotline miami vibe in the narrative and some of the music . you have 2 inputs only here with one shooting downwards while projecting you up and the other shooting forward . your aim is to collect atomiks as a scavenger and the narrative moves to the backseat as you get fully invested into trying to collect all atomiks in each level .', 'i played this on ipad before the switch and have had a lot of fun with both versions . the switch port looks and runs great in both handheld and docked mode . you can even map both inputs to anything on the controller . i am disappointed that they didn’t include the touch mode since this already exists on mobile platforms . if you’ve ever wanted jetpack joyride blended with hotline miami , this is the game for you . i’m gonna have this installed on my switch for a long time . it is super to just jump ( no pun intended ) into this for a bit during breaks .', 'originally released on pc , playstation 4 , xbox one , and ios and scored 8 / 10 on may 18 , 2017 .', 'the switch is already home to various building games with the likes of minecraft , dragon quest builders , and even lego worlds on the platform . each of those takes the core builder game and adds something new to the formula . minecraft of course is the original that is probably one game almost everyone i know with a switch owns . portal knights on the ps4 was an interesting release when i played it around launch . it blends quite a few elements together and is overall a more combat focussed experience . in fact the sandbox overall feels akin to terraria as well in some aspects with the boss fights and co - op experience .', 'portal knights has already seen a release across multiple platforms and the switch release is great but there are a few technical issues . the draw distance is almost too small . it reminds me of no man’s sky on a base ps4 at launch which is really bad . given how dense the grass gets just in the opening tutorial , it is pretty sad seeing an area close by look flat from a distance but suddenly have grass appear when you get closer . i like the touch implementation though . you can use touch to attack or use items and manage your inventory . on the performance side , there were a few slowdowns but nothing to really detract from the overall experience which was a lot of fun . portal knights is a worthy addition to the building game library on the switch next to dragon quest builders which is still my favourite of the lot .', 'a collection of games originally released on ios , android , and nintendo 3ds .', 'square enix seems uninterested in doing anything with the tactics brand they have under the final fantasy ip at this stage . we’ve seen loads of developers try and replicate the magic of tactics but few have gotten close . mercenaries saga launched on phones a while back and was a nice looking final fantasy tactics like experience that felt a bit too pedestrian for its own good . the developers went on to make two sequels for this that saw mobile and nintendo 3ds releases . now , the full trilogy including the previously mobile exclusive release are available together in a single package on the switch in the form of mercenaries saga chronicles . rideon japan’s set of three games is worth experiencing if you’ve been craving an isometric grid based tactics release but can stomache a throwaway plot for the gameplay .', 'the switch release for this collection is good content wise and visually but it is very disappointing when it comes to controls . i’m a big fan of final fantasy tactics on ios with its brilliant touch controls . every grid based strategy game should support touch controls when the hardware supports it . mercenaries saga chronicles not only doesn’t support touch for gameplay but it doesn’t even support touch for menus and navigation . visually , the sprite work and environments look very nice but as expected , there’s some reuse . as a package and given the price point , this is a very good value package for srpg fans with more than 80 story chapters and more free battles .', 'fe , pronounced “fae” is a puzzle platformer where you communicate with the animals of the forest to assist you in solving puzzles . it is at times beautiful and a little eerie with the forest stretching out before you and mysterious bipedal creatures that if they see you will imprison you and re -

held mode .', 'the controls are fairly straight - forward with the additional experience of motion control in docked mode . to communicate with the other animals in the forest you must sing to them , but you have to find and maintain the correct pitch to do so . utilising the motion controls , you flick your right wrist up and down until you find the correct pitch . it feels a little gimmicky and i will admit to preferring to just using the toggle button instead ( something that you can turn on and off in the settings menu ) .', 'i enjoyed fe , but it didn’t blow me away . visually it holds up far more in the hand - held mode and any issues i experienced with a slight motion sickness in docked mode melted away on the smaller screen . fe is a pleasant experience , best enjoyed curled up on the sofa gently singing to the creatures of the forest .', 'all content copyright godisageek . com', 'fonts by google fonts . gj wp !'], ['the legend of zelda : breath of the wild themed jelly beans added to my ninten . . .', 'bargain alert : eb games’ managers specials has some great 3ds , ds and w . . .', 'nintendo sending out smash bros . for 3ds demo codes to club nintendo members', 'nintendo download updates ( 23 / 7 – 29 / 7 ) i can’t believe its not s . . .', 'pokemon go’s ultra bonus announced , legendary raids , region exclusive p . . .', 'animal crossing : pocket camp available on aussie google play store ( update : a . . .', 'a legend of zelda lottery has been announced for japan with a bunch of cool z . . .', 'australia’s national football team , the socceroos , spotted playing swit . . .', 'the legend of zelda : symphony of the goddesses coming to perth and nz ( on sal . . .', 'bargain alert : eb games’ managers specials has some great 3ds , ds and w . . .', 'report : that’s it for the nintendo classic nes mini in australia ( updat . . .', 'when portal knights was first announced , my first reaction was something along the lines of it being another minecraft wanna -

needed supplies , others are barren and full of dangers , but provide some valuable ore . each world you visit will have some form of history about it from before the fracture , sometimes other people will be living in the world as well , letting you have small discussions with the people there . story - wise , the game is not strong , it’s a basic story , with hardly any progression , and what characters you do meet with , usually only say the same line , unless they give you a quest , so don’t come in expecting anything to grand .', 'gameplay is where portal knights shines , at least some of the time , as the gameplay is split equally between mining and exploring and the combat it offers , which again changes depending on your character class . when you start out , the worlds look small , they are not that large , but given that you can dig down a fair way , they actually offer a lot to discover , with each world having one or two buried secrets . the game mixes the exploration and combat quite well , but only if you swap viewpoints a lot , which is the games biggest issue , at least playing it wisely , when you are building or mining you can do so from either a third person or first person perspective . the problem is the controls are way too finicky in their default for a third person view to be a viable option . first person , however , works almost the same as minecraft . the problem comes from when you are mining and discover an enemy , apart from when you are an archer , any form of combat in first person is very hard to do .', 'the game offers you a lock on system , that when engaged , targets a specific character , your character , however , runs around completely free of that lock , so its nothing like the zelda games . in first person , you can lock onto a character that is behind you and then if you move around , you can lose their position , it does not track , in third person though it at least keeps your targeted enemy on the screen . the game even has an option to swap you to a third person view once you enter combat , so it knows that the preferred way to fight is in the third person view . once your combatting is complete , you will need to manually swap back to the first person if you need it — it does not automatically do that — which is just a slight inconvenience really . each of the games view modes works perfectly for one type of the gameplay on offer , but not the other and while i can appreciate they offer the option for players , it’s a shame that you can’t just enjoy one type of viewpoint .', 'once you have established your preferred viewpoint , of course , you will need to get out there and explore the world and doing so is important . as you explore , you will discover many items and mineral that you can use to upgrade your gear and prepare for some the combat that lies ahead . crafting a new weapon , however , will require you to obtain ore , then smelt it , which needs a furnace and coal , then you need the appropriate level of the worktable to build your weapon , so the simple construction requires many steps and many worlds to visit . that is where the fun will come from , for a lot of people at least , having a goal in mind and then heading out to achieve it , is a welcome thing , the only concern to it , is that some worlds feel quite empty compared to others , but with random events that appear , there is usually something to appeal to all .', 'portal knights also suffers from a strange visual look , the characters look like they were pulled from the mysims series which , while not an issue , does not blend with the more grounded look that everything else has . each enemy design looks more dragon quest - esque , with lots of skeletons , bats and what - not to fight . while some of the designs are quite basic , there are a lot of them that do offer some fun looks , though most of these come out at night . the worlds themselves sadly never really vary past the standard , grass plains , desert , jungle , etc ; with each location theme repeating many times over the course of the adventure . where the game struggles with the presentation however , is that each location is filled to the brim with pointless decoration . while playing docked it does lag from time to time , but when on the go , it does it a lot ; thankfully the studio seemed to have noticed this and added a way to turn all that pointless stuff off , which is honestly the best way to view it . sound - wise , the game is fine , creatures all have distinct sounds and they are easy enough to make out over the world audio and the game’s music , no character really speaks , except in the gibberish speak that games like to use , and even then it’s only done when you interact with a character .', 'portal knights on nintendo switch is a great little game — it offers a lot more to the experience than minecraft does , but does not throw you in the deep end like dragon quest builders does , which is coming to switch in 2018 as well . players will likely find more appeal when they play with friends , because on your own , the adventure does not seem so grand . that said , given the number of options that you can employ to customise your experience to your choosing , there is plenty to keep solo adventurers coming back .', 'portal knights on nintendo switch is a great little game — it offers a lot more to the experience than minecraft does , but does not throw you in the deep end like dragon quest builders does , which is coming to switch in 2018 as well . players will likely find more appeal when they play with friends , because on your own , the adventure does not seem so grand . that said , given the number of options that you can employ to customise your experience to your choosing , there is plenty to keep solo adventurers coming back .', 'so , i have been gaming since controllers only had two buttons and because i wanted to , i started my own site . now of course , you can find me writing for vooks as well', 'currently you have javascript disabled . in order to post comments , please make sure javascript and cookies are enabled , and reload the page . click here for instructions on how to enable javascript in your browser .', 'new pokémon let’s go trailer shows off hm replacements , unique moves an . . .', 'pokemon go’s ultra bonus announced , legendary raids , region exclusive p . . .', 'copyright © 2000 -

time , so the following years would be much less expensive ) :', '* note that monthly isp access is based on dial - up service plus one extra phone line , or the typical cost of dsl or cable internet service .', 'at a glance , gamecube is clearly the most economical choice , mainly because of it being the cheapest hardware and not having a standard subscription fee . gamecube also benefits from nintendo’s software policy of not collecting royalties for online games , so compatible software could theoretically be sold at less than the normal msrp for gamecube titles ( not calculated in the table above ) . nintendo is also not demanding any general subscription fee , although individual games or an individual publisher may charge one itself . for example , sega may charge $ 5 per month for access to seganet , which would let you play all of sega’s online games as much as you want . or sega may charge for phantasy star online separately , as they did with the game’s second edition on dreamcast . the bottom line is that nintendo is leaving the choice up to publishers , and nintendo’s own first - party games will presumably be free to play online .', 'sony’s strategy is almost identical to nintendo’s , but their hardware is pricier and the modem is just slightly more expensive , though you do get both 56k and broadband capability in one piece . like nintendo , sony is leaving subscription fees up to the individual publishers , and first - party online games will likely have no monthly fee . sony has no royalty - free plan like nintendo , but there are rumors that the company is planning to cut ps2 software down to $ 40 across the board .', 'microsoft xbox is arguably the easiest console to get online since its modem is already built in and included with the system’s price , but dial - up users will be out of luck . microsoft is the only one of the big three charging a universal network subscription fee . the initial offer is $ 50 for one year , plus a headset communicator ; no announcement has been made as to monthly or annual subscription fees after the initial offer expires . the mandatory subscription fee makes taking xbox online more expensive upfront , but it may turn out to be competitive in the long run depending on what publishers do with nintendo and sony’s more lassez faire attitudes . and , like sony , microsoft is rumored to be considering a universal price cut on xbox software .', 'overall , nintendo looks like the winner at least in terms of price , but there are , of course , many factors involved here that will vary from person to person . if you’re reading this article , you’re probably already paying for isp access every month . . . so that cost is already figured into your budget . you probably also own one or more of these consoles by now , so that takes care of a bulk of the above totals . there is also the issue of a hard drive -

""', ""defeating enemies on each of these worlds and gathering resources gives a chance to find shards of portal stones , and gathering enough of these means full portal stones can be crafted . these can then be used to open a portal to the next world once the doorway for the world has been found . these shards come very quickly at the beginning , when they just consist of blue portals and blue shards - so much so that despite each of the starting worlds having a couple of npcs with side - quests and various different resources to play with the crafting , it ' s easy enough to fly through the first few worlds ."", ""these worlds have diverse biotopes . there are desert worlds with towering cacti , rich forests , and medieval castles . exploiting the resources of each is key to making the most of the game . mining up copper ore in the desert , chopping down the trees in forests , and taking stone from the sides of buildings - it ' s fun at first , unlocking new craftables , then heading back to earlier worlds to track down that one little item , it ' s intrinsically addictive . but , as the game progresses it really loses its way , falling into a terrible amount of grinding at about three quarters of the way through . finding other colours of portal bricks becomes horrendous and required pieces of equipment take a ton of materials ."", 'the crafting itself is enjoyable enough , and there are merchants that sell deeds to nice open space worlds made entirely to freely build a home base . the basic workbench from the beginning of the game can craft numerous specialist crafting stations , forges can mould bars of metals , and a drafting cable can be used to produce decorative aspects of the home base ; not to mention specific stations for creating the weapons of each class - such as an archery station for the rogue . plenty to keep the crafters busy , whether they be interested in maxing out stats or building whatever their inspiration desires .', 'outside of these familiar elements of crafting and exploring , portal knights focuses on adding some arpg elements to the mix . upon starting the game , there are three classes to choose from : rogue , warrior , or mage , followed by a simple little character creator . it offers up a handful of eyes , haircuts , mouths , and ears , which deliver ugly , little , monkey - looking , chibi characters . npcs all share the same style and speak in some strange simlish style language . this gruesome little character has all the attributes of a simple rpg character , with stam , dex , int et al , and progressing gives points to increase these attributes , along with giving points to unlock special class specific skills .', 'the combat system is very basic , with just an attack and dodge to begin . most enemies are easily abused by making use of the terrain to break line of sight or get enemies stuck on little outcroppings , and the ai will more often than not be satisfied to stand there taking punishment . thankfully , later in the game the enemies begin to offer more of a challenge , moving quicker and quicker , packing groups close together instead of individuals that can be picked off , and dealing silly amounts of damage . the best way to take on this extra level of difficulty is by staying on top of the crafting , and developing more powerful equipment , along with special attacks . these also become a necessity with the bosses that periodically appear here and there through the worlds .', ""another way to overcome the enemies in each world is by getting some help . there ' s online multiplayer available with full drop - in , drop - out . it makes the combat infinitely easier , but the crafting much harder as resources need to be split between the party ."", 'being a switch port , this version gives a new way to play that none of the others have offered : portably . the big screen docked version is comparable in every way to its playstation and xbox counterparts , but the portable version is a great fit , letting players go farm some food or mine some stone , or add that extra wing onto their castle while on the commute . the touchscreen is a great help , too , when it comes to quickly switching between elements in the inventory and on the quick bar - even making it easier on aiming where to place the bricks .', ""unlike most minecraft clones , portal knights delivers an experience wholly its own and for the most part it succeeds . playing through the main story is a highly enjoyable experience and for those who are looking for a new sandbox to build in . the home worlds allow the freedom to craft to your heart ' s content . it ' s even better with friends , too . the inclusion of co - op was a very wise choice and gives yet another element to elevate it above its competitors ."", 'there are no replies to this review yet . why not be the first ?', 'enter the letters in the image to validate your comment .', 'if you are a registered member and logged in , you can also subscribe to topics by email .', ""i don ' t know about you , but i ' m feeling 22 .

rpg gamers will likely start out with . he eventually earns healing abilities and his skill tree is focused on more of a balanced approach . you have the tank character that takes tons of damage and deals out even more but lacks in speed and quickness . the siren who specializes in corrosive weaponry and can even turn invisible , and finally the hunter who is deadly with a sniper rifle and a bit crazy to boot . the best part is that you can have multiple saves and experiment with each character as you see fit . each one plays differently enough that playing through each one is worth it if you enjoy the game . considering maxing out to level 50 takes quite some time , this could pose an interesting undertaking .', 'one of the reasons borderlands is so addictive is the rpg elements . you earn experience for every enemy you take down and each quest you complete . earning experience eventually levels you up , and once you open up your abilities and skill tree things get very interesting . each character has a unique tree that allows you to customize your attributes as you see fit . you can also re - arrange them later in the game to attempt a different path . the main skill for each character stands as the front runner , for instance the soldier has access to a turret that eventually can be used to heal characters and even replenish bullets when activated . what gets so addictive about all of this is that you are slowly transitioned into each ability and learning how to distribute points and tune it to your play style is a learning progress . you can even share you character tree online at the borderlands website .', 'the quests are also broken down into categories depending on your level . there are numerous spots to obtain them and they range from simply killing a set number of enemies to collecting pieces of a broken sniper rifle and beyond . the biggest draw for me was that addiction of ‘just one more quest’ . when you turn one in there is always another one waiting on you . i also like how it gauges the difficulty based on your level . quests can also give you bonus and special items , as well as money and experience . quests also open up new areas of the world and of course new vehicles and weapons which only adds to their addictiveness .', 'when you first pick up the controller you will quickly realize that borderlands is a shooter with built in rpg elements . this varies from the other game people like to compare it to , fallout 3 . fallout felt more like an rpg with shooter elements built into it . this is probably why the two games feels strikingly different , but still vaguely familiar . borderlands plays host to one of the smoothest engines for a shooter i have played this gen . aiming is silky smooth and the hit detection is spot on . there is rarely anything more satisfying than nailing a critical hit on an enemy and watching their head explode into a fountain of blood ; gory , but still ultimately satisfying . it is also worth noting that each gun feels amazingly unique . thanks to special abilities in certain weapons and the balance played into each attribute , you can definitely feel a difference when you pick up a superb firearm , and it really attaches you to it .', 'the core game is plenty enough to keep you enthralled , but if you want the really good loot you will need to hop online and play some co - op . up to four players can jump into the world of pandora together , and you can help friends power level much like blizzard’s popular mmo . when playing online you can gather some of the best loot because the enemies are tougher and in greater numbers . my experience was pretty smooth across the board , and even when playing with someone much higher or lower of a level than me it balances nicely . you can also start a duel with another player by melee attacking them . this serves little purpose outside of displaying your dominance among the herd .', 'anyone following the progress of the game no doubt noticed when the art direction took a drastic turn from realism to a more cartoon inspired look . the world of pandora is a dusty place , but the new visuals do a great job of conveying atmosphere . enemy designs are fantastic and the areas are distinct enough to keep them from bleeding into each other . the guns are also all very unique in design and the frame rate handles itself quite well . the only complaint visually is that the texture pop - in can be bothersome when you don’t install the game to the xbox 360 hard drive . the user interface takes a little while to get used to mainly because of its abundance of information . once you get it down though you will appreciate how much info it delivers in such a crowded area .', 'sounds are equally impressive with some truly hilarious dialogue to accompany the outlandish character designs . the music fits the setting well and increases when it needs to , mostly during boss battles and intense areas . there are audio files scattered around that are also entertaining and enough cannot be said about the clap trap robots . i swear they stole our “uhn tiss uhn tiss” techno song from the weekly podcast , but they are nonetheless hilarious . everything in the world of borderlands seems to fit and is well implemented . presentation is another area where the team has excelled .', 'borderlands is one of the biggest surprises of the year not because of how good it is , but how good it is considering the lack of hype . this game has single - handedly stolen my soul since it arrived at my doorstep and i find myself needing to level up once a night , much like my wife and her world of warcraft addiction . if you are a fan of shooters or loot gathering games do not hesitate , just buy the game already . the 50 level cap may seem like a burden , but trust me there is more than enough here to warrant a purchase . this is one of the best games out right now and easily in my top five games of the entire year .', 'ken is the editor -

putting to rpg fans is that unlike most other rpg - shooter hybrids on the market ( mass effect , hellgate : london , tabula rasa , etc . ) , borderlands really cares about the twitch aspects of its gameplay . fans of shooters will be right at home because a headshot is a critical hit and there are some armored enemies that require shots to certain areas . those who are not fond of twitch gameplay - and i know some of our readers number here - will not be impressed with borderlands . that ' s really the only major caveat to an rpg fan ; the gameplay is not relegated simply to a statistics system , although every item in the game is bound to a set of them ."", ""the structure of the game is akin to a combination of fallout 3 or the elder scrolls and diablo . players maneuver the overworld and obtain quests like they would in any number of rpgs , level up , and get more gear . it ' s the most basic of basics , and while that would normally be a downer , borderlands ' exquisite control scheme and - most importantly - co - op multi - player are a step above most rpgs ' . those who have played call of duty : modern warfare or any other similar shooter will be right at home with the control scheme . there ' s no vats or pausing or anything of the sort - you shoot a guy , he gets hurt . you shoot a guy in the head or a monster in its weak spot , he gets hurt more . how you ' re shooting him and what you ' re shooting him with have everything to do with the weapons that you ' ve got and the class that chose ."", ""borderlands offers four classes : the sniping hunter , the stealthy siren , the gung - ho soldier , and brick , as himself . all four of the classes use primarily guns , but have access to melee attacks as well . brick has access to incredibly powerful melee attacks as his class power , the siren can stealth - walk , the soldier can lay down a turret with some cover , and the hunter summons a hunting hawk to fight by his side . all four classes feature three skill trees that focus on different weapons and abilities . a lot of these do focus on things that help the team out , so it ' s very clear that co - op was one of the key features considered at gearbox , but there are still plenty of places for soloers to spend their skill points . each level up gives a skill point , some hit points , and the ability for players to wear bigger and better guns . it ' s pretty standard , and like mmorpgs , players receive a bonus to hit and damage against lower level enemies , but a penalty to hit and damage against higher level enemies ."", ""there ' s not much depth to the basics of the statistics system , until players start getting deeper into the weapons . gearbox and 2k have advertised the title as having more than 16 million different guns , but this is all due to the diablo - style loot system . there are about ten major categories of guns , and each class is proficient with about two of them , though there are no restrictions on who can use what gun , simply the level restrictions for more powerful guns . all of the weapon drops in the game are ranked on the wow - style color - coded system : white - green - blue - purple - orange from most common to most rare . these weapons have a range of extra abilities , elemental affinities , and many other statistics such as reload speed . while there may not really be sixteen million different guns in the game , changing from shotgun to shotgun does feel different because of what they do . there are even some unique weapons that feature things like richocheting or spiraling bullets , or the ability to fire multiple bullets with a single shot . the weapons in the game really are quite nifty , and it ' s part of the reason the game has massive replay value and a draw to keep playing ."", 'the quest system and the world are , at best , derivative . players pick up quests at hub cities , run out and do them , and come back . there are stories behind the quests themselves , but much like those in world of warcraft , i tend to boil them down to their basic "" kill 7 goats "" functionalities rather than taking in the story . there are some that put the story in your lap , as many quests provide audio fleshing out the backstory of the planet of pandora , but i never felt the need to go out of my way to explore the backstory . players take control of a mercenary , searching for the lost vault , which will bestow upon them riches and power , yadda yadda yadda . the plot is pedestrian at best , but honestly , no one is going to be playing borderlands for its amazing plot . what the game does feature is characters that are very funny - even random enemies are named things like "" badass midget shotgunner . "" there are also references to anything and everything imaginable . from mad max to die hard to even spaceballs ( my favorite ! ) , chances are there is some obscure reference here that will put a smile on your face . it makes up a little bit for the mediocre story , but because of the gameplay , it \' s not a huge blow that there \' s not an amazing plot .', ""the ambience of the game itself is something that ' s ripped straight from the science fiction handbook . it ' s a generic post - apocalyptic wasteland - except for the fact that there are vending machines everywhere . all of the environments look fairly similar , as do the enemies . a level 5 psycho looks like a level 45 psycho , and there ' s not a great deal of variety between enemies . there are a few palette swapped enemies , and it all starts looking the same after a while . the graphics are technically proficient , the entire game being cel - shaded , but still incredibly bloody . explosions , gun fire , just about everything looks great , although there ' s not much customization with the characters themselves , aside from basic color . it ' s unfortunate that players can ' t really create their own avatar , but it ' s a minor gripe in the end ."", ""along with the story , the segment of the game that has the most flaws is the audio . sound effects and gunshots are great , but there ' s not a great deal of music and the voice acting is pretty bad for a lot of the story audio . there ' s not much that ' s there , and some of the voices - such as the mysterious woman who is guiding you , work great . others , such as the female researcher whom players will find audio clips from her diary , are horrid . it ' s a mixed bag , but easily ignorable because of the solid gameplay under the hood ."", 'in short , borderlands is a top - quality shooter and grind - fest . there \' s not much that \' s new about it , and it \' s not without its flaws . if you \' re willing to take down a horde of enemies just to see that "" level up ! "" icon or for that shiny new drop , borderlands will be right up your alley . even if you \' re not the kind of gamer that \' s fond of the grindy loot - fest , borderlands \' co - op play makes it great fun no matter what . unless you absolutely just abhor twitch - based titles , borderlands should start spinning in your game system soon - unless it \' s already there .', '© 2009 2k games , gearbox software . all rights reserved .'], ['gamemill entertainment released the first trailer for their newest title , nickelodeon kart racers , a multi -

ridden planet of pandora , there is one thing that draws off - world attention : the vault . this mysterious alien structure is rumored to hold treasures of fantastic power and wealth , and so it attracts fortune - seeking corporations and individuals alike . in borderlands , you are one such individual , but the satisfaction of unlocking the vault ' s secrets pales in comparison to the rollicking good time you ' ll have on your way there . borderlands is all about the journey , not the destination , and like most trips , this one is much better when you have some friends along for the ride . solo players can still have a good time , because the bloody and entertaining combat is paired well with rewarding loot and engaging experience systems . but pandora is a lonely place for a solitary mercenary , and lone wolves will find the pace deliberate and the friendly characters too few and far between . those who take advantage of the two - player split - screen mode or four - player online cooperative mode will experience the game as it ' s meant to be played , though playstation 3 owners will have a tougher time of it . getting into a public online game is problematic , and it ' s next to impossible to invite anyone from your friends list to join you . yet the core experience still satisfies , and the pleasing rhythm of killing enemies , gathering loot , and cashing in is punctuated by fighting bosses , completing quests , and leveling up . as a solo merc , this rhythm is slow and methodical , but as a team , the pace quickens to an invigorating clip and pretty soon you ' ve spent hours having a riotously rewarding time ."", ""the world of pandora has a dusty , run - down feel , yet it manages to be vibrant and eye - catching at the same time . the art style features black - line borders and a colorful palette that give the game a not - quite - comic , not - quite - cel - shaded look . it takes some getting used to , and occasional jaggies and slow - to - load textures reflect its less - than - perfect technical execution . yet what borderlands lacks in precision it more than makes up for in style , and hours into the game you ' ll still be appreciating the thoughtful design touches that bring this world to life . though the different environments occasionally feel too similar , there is enough distinct detail to keep them from blurring together . your vanquished enemies also do their part to keep things visually interesting by dying in a variety of gruesome and entertaining ways . bodies explode , limbs fly off , and burning enemies occasionally disintegrate from the ground up until only the mask of their face is left hanging in midair . it sounds ( and is a bit ) horrifying , but when the mask drops comically to the floor and finally burns up , don ' t bother stifling that chuckle . the art design resonates well with borderlands ' irreverent sense of humor , and the game is playful without feeling too goofy ."", ""you travel through this world as one of four characters , each with a unique look and attitude . you don ' t really get to appreciate the character designs if you play solo because you have no ai teammates , but you do hear frequent quips that give you a little bit of character - specific flavor . the most important difference between characters is the action skill , which is a special ability that can give you an edge in combat . the hunter can release a vicious bird of prey ; the soldier can throw down an automatic turret flanked by shields ; the siren can turn invisible and speedy , damaging all enemies in the vicinity ; and the berserker flies into a damage - resistant rage and delivers brutal punches to his enemies . you unlock these abilities after playing for a short while , and not only are they all fun to use , but each one can be customized in a couple of strategically distinct ways . you can tweak and upgrade your ability by investing skill points in appropriate skills . so , for example , upgrading the hunter ' s bird of prey not only can increase the amount of damage it does , but can make it attack multiple targets , steal health from them , slow them down for easy sniping , and cause them to drop more loot . expanding your action skill makes you more deadly in combat , and it ' s one of the most rewarding parts of leveling up . killing enemies , finishing quests , and completing in - game bonus challenges earn you experience points , which in turn earn you a new level . leveling up boosts your overall fortitude and grants you a precious skill point to use however you see fit ."", ""you can also spend your skill points on other improvements , and each character has three different skill trees that highlight different tactics and abilities . so the soldier can essentially become the team medic by developing the skills that allow him to shoot teammates to regenerate their health and that make his turret create a healing radius . or he could choose to become more deadly , increasing his turret damage and combat rifle performance . though your weapon proficiency improves based on how much you use a given weapon type , different characters have skills that favor different types of guns , so it ' s to your advantage to play to your character ' s strengths . the berserker can certainly become proficient with the sniper rifle , but his melee - focused action skill and preference for rocket launchers make him a better choice for wading into the fray . though the branching skill trees offer intriguing ways to specialize , your initial character choice has the biggest impact on how you ' ll go through the game . fortunately , each character is fun and deadly in his own way , so you can ' t choose poorly , and you ' ll probably want to experience what each one has to offer . playing cooperatively allows you to enjoy and benefit from the other characters ' abilities , something you don ' t get to appreciate when playing solo , unless you start a new game ."", ""this guy isn ' t nearly as scary when you have three other mercs backing you up ."", 'expanding your abilities and leveling up is one of the main ways that borderlands consistently rewards you . loot is another . loot can be found in containers , dropped by enemies , or given to you as a quest reward . it includes money , ammo , shields , mods that boost and alter your grenades , mods that boost your skills , and , of course , guns . guns are classified in familiar categories : pistols , submachine guns , shotguns , combat rifles , sniper rifles , rocket launchers , and so on . each class feels distinct , and the shooting mechanics are well tuned and satisfying , which makes it fun to blast baddies . base damage , clip size , fire rate , accuracy , and bullet spread are just some of the variables within each class , and some guns have more exotic features , like bladed pistols that increase melee damage or a shotgun that also shoots rockets . they can also do elemental damage , which comes in a variety of flavors that put a special kind of hurt on and can even do damage over time . equip an incendiary gun if you want to burn flesh , or a corrosive gun if you want to deal extra damage to creatures with tough hides .', 'you will come across a huge number of guns in your travels , though most are only good for selling back to the many vending machines around pandora . however , you will continually find better guns throughout your journey , and because a sweet gun or awesome shield could be be found on the remains of any human or animal and in any inanimate storage container , you \' ll spend a lot of time searching and picking things up . there is a lot of stuff to pick up in borderlands , and it can be a bit unsettling when you realize just how much of the game you might have to spend looking down at the ground , pressing a button to grab your loot . initially , it feels like you \' re looking down and pressing a button far too often . but as you progress , you \' ll become a more proficient loot - grabber , and you won \' t be bothered by the action . you \' ll even grow to love the sight of a battlefield littered with the tiny towers of light that seem to proclaim , "" grab me ! "" watching your loot fly towards you and hearing it lodge in your inventory is satisfying , though there is another kink in the works . you can hold the reload button to pick up all the ammo and money nearby ( something you \' ll want to do often ) , but if you hold the button while looking at a gun , you \' ll immediately equip it . this can cause you to equip some bogus guns if you \' re not careful , but this is quickly remedied and rarely too bothersome . you can compare guns within your inventory , and if you \' ve used up your limited space , you can check the specs on a fallen gun easily and drop one from your inventory if you like .', 'corrosive skag spit vs . incendiary sniper rounds .', ""unfortunately , dropping items is also the only way you can give them to your teammates , and there ' s no way to exchange ammo or money . if teammates are using the same type of gun , this can lead to some problematic ammo shortages , which is another reason to play to your character ' s strengths . this can also lead to disputes over who gets that fancy new shotgun , so it ' s best to have a gentleman ' s agreement in place over how to handle these issues . borderlands allows you to resolve disputes by melee attacking a friendly player and challenging him to a duel . if your teammate melees you back , a colored dome pops up and the two of you fight to the death . the loser doesn ' t actually die , just loses some health , and there ' s no way to put a wager on the match , so the victor doesn ' t necessarily receive the spoils . as long as you ' re playing with a respectful group , you should be able to avoid loot - hoggers and the like , but it ' s still a bit disappointing that there isn ' t a better way to pool and equally distribute your collective resources ."", 'even more disappointing are the serious online issues that plague the ps3 version . after waiting for slow - to - load menus and enduring possible lock - ups , you can get into a public match and play at a good connection speed . however , inviting players from your friends list into a game is nearly impossible , because the game inexplicably populates the "" invite friends "" window with a small , random fraction of your friends who may not even be online . not being able to play with your buddies is a big problem , and anyone hoping not to play solo is resigned to the luck of the draw . when you do manage to join up with other players , borderlands does a good job of adjusting enemy difficulty to accommodate you , though the larger the level gap , the easier it will be for higher level players , and the tougher it will be for lower level players . it \' s worth noting that the story - related missions - - that is , the ones you have to perform in sequence - - reflect the host \' s progress , and players who are behind the host may not get credit for completing certain missions .', ""having some friends on your side makes things a lot more pleasant , given that about 99 percent of life on pandora is your enemy . human enemies range from bandits that are smart enough to wear shields and take cover to psychos that light themselves on fire and sprint toward you , screaming about rending your flesh from your bones . the local wildlife is universally hostile and includes skags ( toothy dog - beasts ) , spiderants ( armored insect monsters ) , rakks ( raggedy death bats ) , and scythids ( wriggling prehistoric grubs ) . every type of enemy appears in various incarnations , ranging from young and weak to badass and on fire . these variations are generated anew during each encounter , so even when you kill a clutch of enemies in that same gully for the fourth time , it will be a different bad - guy loadout . you ' ll fight hundreds of each enemy type throughout the game , and the fact that groups are varied goes a long way toward staving off repetition . the two - seater vehicles also offer some locomotive variety , and many of the areas are much more fun to traverse on four wheels than on two legs . you can conjure the lone vehicle type from the many catch - a - ride stations . the touchy handling takes some getting used to , and you can run into some exaggerated physics problems when crashing into rocks . however , there ' s nothing quite like vehicular homicide to stave off bandit - killing fatigue . in or out of a vehicle , the simple act of killing enemies is pretty fun , and since you ' re constantly reaping loot and experience rewards , even repeated encounters have some incentive attached to them ."", 'the crisp inventory screen makes managing guns , shields , and other items quick and easy . .', ""the combined incentives of killing enemies , gathering loot , cashing in , and leveling up are the main driving forces in borderlands . the various quests you undertake cover a good variety of motivations , but most follow the pattern mentioned in the previous sentence . the 1 percent of life on pandora that isn ' t your enemy will often have quests for you , though only a handful of characters are voice - acted . of these , there are a few standouts , including the bumpkin car - rental mogul and the borderline sociopathic archaeologist , but for the most part borderlands offers precious little in the way of non - player character contact . this makes playing solo a lonely experience . though the action is still satisfying and the world is still interesting , solo players will have a slower - paced adventure in which the flashes of comedy also serve to underscore how sparse those flashes are . the main story is thin and the final encounter is pointless and thoroughly unsatisfying , so anyone hoping borderlands will deliver a climactic conclusion is almost certainly going to be disappointed ."", ""after you uncover the secrets of the vault , you are once again set loose into pandora , where you are free to quest on and remember why you enjoyed your previous hours with the game . borderlands has tens of hours of quests to fulfill , and you ' ll likely find yourself enticed back to explore new skills , find new guns , and kill more enemies . though the core action doesn ' t change drastically over the course of the game , it is woven together in such a way that once it ensnares you , you ' ll want nothing more than to plunge into pandora at any chance you get . combat is satisfying , and upgrading your skills and equipment is engaging . the constant stream of loot and experience is rewarding , and sharing it with some friends makes the experience that much richer and more exciting . alas , ps3 owners will have to wait for a fix in order to fight alongside their friends . despite this upsetting issue , pandora is still a great planet to visit if you want to shoot some stuff and reap the rewards ."", 'chris enjoys aiming down virtual sights , traipsing through fantastical lands , and striving to be grossly incandescent .', 'get the latest news and videos for this game daily , no spam , no fuss .', ""we ' ll begin emailing you updates about % gamename % ."", 'borderlands is an rpg sci -

world driver championship,"[['the switch is quite clearly becoming the go - to machine for ‘shmup’ games . whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing would depend on your own experience and enjoyment of the genre , but having such a variety of titles to choose from is nothing to moan about . samurai aces is one of the latest additions to the console , and coming from original developer psikyo , it plays a lot like gunbird – so much so , in fact , that the uninitiated might actually mistake it as the same game , right down to the identical power - up icons and overall art style .', 'in fairly standard fashion , samurai aces gives you a selection of characters / vehicles to choose from , each of which well equipped to shoot down anything in your path , but none containing specific advantages or disadvantages to the others – your choice is largely down to personal preference . you must then utilise your character to progress through seven levels ( if you can ) , and there’s little more to it other than move and shoot , but that’s all you need with a game of this nature . its gameplay is so sharp and focused , it would be a disservice to pad it with unnecessary bulk .', 'much like with gunbird , samurai aces once again caters to all manner of players , with a range of difficulty levels designed to either let you coast through the game , or get your ass handed to you repeatedly – in the game’s higher difficulty levels , should you die enough times , it’s game over entirely and you’ll need to start again from scratch .', 'the levels themselves are suitably varied , and you’ll find yourself flying over a host of varied , attractive locales . you’ll need to stay on your toes , though . much of what you see can potentially kill you , and soon enough you’ll have a barrage of bullets flying toward you in all directions , and even the enemies themselves will occasionally zoom towards you , kamikaze style . should you proceed through the level intact , you’ll come across a boss . these can be thrilling battles , requiring you to target specific areas in order to bring them down , but with hundreds of bullets coming toward you at the same time , your ability to balance defence and offence becomes paramount .', 'graphically , fans of retro games will be well at home with samurai aces – let’s not forget , of course , that the game originally came out in 1993 , so the sprite work is absolutely top notch . the enemy design is really well thought out , from basic crafts to bizarre sea creatures and even some humanoid cyborgs zooming around the stage . there’s a lot to admire amongst all the carnage , and the game really pops whether you’re playing in handheld mode or docked mode .', 'finally , if you’re playing through samurai aces in handheld mode , you’ve got a lovely option to play the game in tate mode ( which allows you to tilt the console’s screen vertically ) . of course if you somehow have the ability to play in this mode whilst docked as well , go right ahead , but for everyone else , the game will display the action in the centre third of the screen , with the remainder displaying stats and character artwork . it’s nice that this area is accounted for rather than left entirely blank .', ""samurai aces is a solid shmup that is sure to please fans of the genre . personally , the game felt a bit too similar to previous title gunbird - but then again , why fix what isn ' t broken ? if you ' re after fast - paced , intense gameplay , look no further ."", 'you must be logged in to post a comment .'], [""switch owners sure have been treated to a lot of arcade buried treasures over the past months . samurai aces ( aka sengoku ace ) is psikyo ' s first game ever so how does it compare to their more contemporary shmups ?"", ""samurai aces is a rather simple shoot ' em up that defined psikyo ' s unique take on the genre . you ' ll come across familiar -

o ( or is that kenn - 0 ? ) , flush the samurai , holy tomboy miko , or gadget gen ; weaving through oncoming projectiles while blasting away the hordes of enemies will feel right at home for any genre fan , especially those who enjoy psikyo ' s unique flavour . overall , the shooting is a blast ( pun intended ) and playing cooperatively with a friend makes it all the more enjoyable ."", 'one thing that sengoku ace accomplishes very well is blending an ancient japanese setting with steampunk aircrafts and action -

up logic "" option ( which is turned to off during the championship mode , by the way ) and watch the whole race in a gorgeous full - screen replay . smack - talking during the replay while pointing out your opponent \' s driving mistakes is of course essential to the enjoyment of the two -

up . les gets , for example , is perfectly clear at points and overcast with a sheet of thin , translucent fog at others . it ' s a minor detail that makes a big difference in the realism department . world driver ' s las vegas track actually looks like vegas , with all the right buildings ( names and signs are of course changed to protect the innocent ) and huge skyscrapers and glitzy lights fill the scene . kyoto features dark , gloomy clouds and a very stylized , yet realistic backdrop with japanese road signs and neon ads . there ' s even a yodobashi camera store for gamers who can read japanese . . . other levels feature sunsets with one of the most impressive lens flares we ' ve seen to date and certainly the best yet for nintendo 64 ."", ""vehicle models have a high poly -

slinging run the player constantly gets random upgrades either in treasure chests , in shops , or by leveling up using experience points gained by killing enemies . the combo system helps you rack up more xp by killing multiple enemies at once , and this can be made much easier by the use of certain upgrades . when leveling up , the player has a choice of three enhancement options , letting them tailor their gameplay to their own style . some of these upgrades even give you straight - up new abilities that completely change how you can play the game , along with the discoverable subweapons .', 'yes , besides using your trusty bombs , sub - weapons are also randomly scattered throughout each of the four areas . these vary greatly from simple obstacles to trap enemies to amazingly powerful weapons to help gain the upper hand . discovering each of these and experimenting with them was very exciting for me , as i never knew what was going to come up next .', 'the multiplayer mode included is about what you’d expect from your standard bomberman game , which is not a bad thing . up to four friends ( or cpus ) can get together to play either a deathmatch or last man standing match set inside 12 different maps . the gameplay doesn’t vary too much from the single player campaign with the main change being that upgrades to your character drop much more frequently on the map , creating quite the frenzy of a battle indeed . while not the most groundbreaking experience , any time a game can add in a fun multiplayer mode for my friends and i to enjoy is a good play in my book , and we ended up having a great time .', 'with the combination of the easy -

based level with indestructible pillars , objects to destroy , and enemies to defeat . planting a bomb destroys or harms objects equally to four sides , unless we upgrade our abilities or find items for special powers ."", 'this simple concept is expanded upon throughout the adventure mode . before jumping into the first stage , we can choose one of several items . as we unlock more items , we get more item slots , providing us with a helpful means of progression even when we fail . items can provide a second life or additional bombs , firepower , health , luck , spirit and more ; this enables and encourages experimentation before each new run .', 'once we jump into the first stage , bombslinger \' s main influence becomes abundantly clear . each randomly generated level is comprised of rooms that eventually lead us to a boss fight . the layout of the rooms and the stage map look as if they were plucked from the binding of isaac — only with a wild west bomberman skin on top . when we enter a new room , we need to clear it in order to advance . in doing so , we may earn experience , item , money or spirit . experience enables us to level up and increase select stats , money is used in shops to buy additional items , and spirit is basically a "" mana bar "" that regulates how often we can use items , such as firepower or additional health . keys and treasure chests are also littered around the rooms .', ""roguelite nature aside , what makes bombslinger different from bomberman is the way the gameplay evolves due to items , which can actually change how you play a level . you can lay traps in an enemy ' s path , use camouflage to hide , and fire long - range weapons . add abilities like kicking a bomb down an aisle and dodging bullets , and the later levels of bombslinger feel less and less like bomberman . that alone may disgruntle bomberman fans , but it helps the game distinguish itself . it ' s also fairly difficult when you ' re starting out , so the beginning of the journey is a bit of a grind ."", ""as in other roguelites , boss battles are the grand finale of each stage . they are different and challenging , and they maintain bombslinger ' s slightly weird vibe . from the first stage onward , the difficulty level of regular enemies ramps up rather quickly . it provides a sense of progression , but you must figure out how to defeat new enemy types while also leveling up your character . as a result , the game feels too tough at the outset . bombslinger sends you back to square one numerous times until you eventually unlock the second and third item slots , which make the game manageable . combined with stats that seem too low at the beginning , such as your run speed , it feels like the game is artificially increasing its difficulty , which can lead to frustration ."", ""while the stages are different and have their own charm and appeal , they can get pretty tiresome when visited in what feels like the hundredth time in a row . separated from the level design , bombslinger ' s visuals are very nice to look at and surpassed my expectations . bombslinger uses beautiful 2 - d pixel art sprites in a 3 - d environment , and rich and brutal visual effects are on display when you ' re pulverizing your enemies . the game zooms in when you enter the shop environment , resulting in a peculiar perspective that somehow works with the bombslinger vibe . the visuals succeed here without any major complaints . the overall performance is also smooth ; no matter how you play , bombslinger looks vibrant on the switch ' s screen in handheld mode ."", ""the level design may be randomized , but it works all right . as i ' d mentioned , you may grow tired of a few stages because you have to redo them very often , and the variation within stages can be rather limited , so they feel very similar even though the layout has changed . add to that the rather average guitar riffs that are supposed to emulate a wild wong tune , and the game can feel tiresome when you get stuck — and believe me , you will get stuck ."", ""if you ' re up for some classic bomberman multiplayer action , bombslinger also has you covered with local four - player modes : deathmatch or last man standing . online capabilities would have been a dream , but local couch multiplayer will provide you with some fun times . it ' s a solid addition that doesn ' t feel tacked - on , and it increases the value of a well - executed budget game ."", ""in summary , bombslinger feels like a mix of several familiar concepts but manages to be greater than the sum of its parts . it ' s not perfect , with a steep difficulty setting and unfriendly amounts of grinding . the visuals are great , and the overall experience is fun , so you should pick up bombslinger on the eshop for $ 12 — unless you hate roguelites ."", ""' whispering willows ' ( all ) comes to nintendo switch this . . .""], ['html public "" -

game fans know , racing games on the n64 usually suffer from one of two things : pop - up or fog . world driver , however , is one of the system ' s first racing games to have a minimal amount of each . this was accomplished by using strategically designed tracks that help hide the track building pretty well . these cleverly designed tracks also allow the game to have up to eight vehicles onscreen at one time , although when this happens the otherwise constant frame rate does falter ."", ""the music in the game is of the glam - rock type - lots of cheesy repetitive guitar licks and lots of bass and snare drums clashing over and over again . i ' ll take a plain , nondescript techno beat over an annoyingly repetitive rock ditty any day . the one good thing about the music is that it can be turned off . when off , you can here all the authentic engine sounds - that is , when you listen carefully over the constantly squealing tires ."", ""in the end , world driver championship is an average racing game with exceptional graphics . the game ' s incredible visuals give you a sense of realism for a little while , but the second your car starts to do an excessive slide around a turn , it kind of falls apart . the game also never really gives you the sensation of the speed at which your car is traveling , even later in the game when you have cars that can really move . the speedometer tells you that you ' re doing 120 mph , but it feels more like you ' re going 60 . while world driver isn ' t a bad game , it is a questionable buy . it ' s definitely worth renting ."", 'get the latest news and videos for this game daily , no spam , no fuss .', ""we ' ll begin emailing you updates about % gamename % ."", 'world driver championship is an average racing game with exceptional graphics .', '© 2018 cbs interactive inc . all rights reserved .']]"

up , draw - in , or slowdown whatsoever . this is even more incredible when you consider that there may be as many as 4 or 5 other cars on screen during a race .', 'you might draw the conclusion that to maintain the consistent pace the game has to make sacrifices . quite simply , vanishing point sacrifices little , if anything . each licensed car in the game has a fair amount of detail . bumpers , taillights , body frames and more are exact replicas of the real life ford explorers , mustangs , lotus elises , and more .', ""the tracks are equally appealing . an english countryside course features brick roads in spots and a scenic backdrop . along the course you ' ll find picturesque bridges and churches . no matter where you look , the textures are appealing . some city courses incorporate convincing elevation changes . cabled suspension bridges and tunnels come around every now and then to break up the lush green cityscape that mixes buildings and trees . about the only complaint you can find with the game is that some of the courses are too dark . night driving had me guessing which way to turn until i turned the brightness up on the television ."", ""another driving game , another cheesy musical score . the music in the game follows the same mold as games like need for speed 3 , with its somewhat techno score . while not totally objectionable , after awhile the repetitive tunes have played their course . once you turn the tunes off , you ' ll hear the sounds of each licensed car . you ' ll instantly realize that each car has a unique engine sound . in addition to the various revs of engines , tire squeal provides feedback for the state of grip . you ' ll always be able to tell when you ' re on the brink of sliding with a convincing squeal . where you aren ' t convinced about the sound is with collisions . no game has made a convincing crash sound and vanishing point , with its amateurish crunch sound , advances this area no further ."", 'when i first got vanishing point , i focused on just a single mode . the menus , which are laid out simply , took me straight to the tournament mode , where i had my choice of a ford explorer or ford mustang . the simple menus took me from intro screen to racing quickly , and i was already having fun . with time i dabbled in the other modes in the game . aside from the lengthy tournament mode , acclaim packed plenty of other options in the game . an online internet mode lets you post your best times to acclaims site for bragging rights . the single race mode lets you race with any unlocked car on any unlocked course . the multiplayer modes , which must be unlocked , range from head to head racing to chicken runs , where players come at each other in opposite directions . in total , there are around a half -
