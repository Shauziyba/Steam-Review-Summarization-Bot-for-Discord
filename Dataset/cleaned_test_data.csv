player campaign involves a riveting and emotional story , and the inclusion of co - op is fantastic . the game itself however is heavily weighted towards multiplayer , as was its predecessor .\', \'call of duty is possibly one of the biggest names in the first person shooter genre .\', \'very few people will not have heard of call of duty 4 : modern warfare , and there are many people out there extremely skilled in the online multiplayer .\', \'call of duty : world at war has large boots to fill , and anticipation is high . can the new title live up to the hype , and has treyarch finally pulled a truly epic shooter out of their hat ?\', ""call of duty : world at war has taken the call of duty series back to world war two once again . it \' s been several years since we had a decent wwii shooter ( although brothers in arms caught our attention a few weeks back ) so it \' s a real pleasure to go back to this time , particularly since call of duty : world at war takes the player across several combat theatres ."", \'battles take place in the pacific , eastern europe , and of course berlin , all the way into the reichstag . this variation in scenery really spices up the title , as few games have given us a taste of what war in the pacific entailed . call of duty : world at war puts you in the shoes of soviet and us soldiers , and although it would be nice to have been able to play an anzac soldier or similar , the worldwide appeal is no doubt greater for the others .\', \'being based on a modified call of duty 4 : modern warfare engine , the game looks and plays fabulously , just as its predecessor did . the environments look stunning , and there were moments that truly filled us with awe , for example standing in the middle of the reichstag in front of the reichs adler , or under its massive , partially destroyed glass roof . it certainly felt as though we were there . the destruction and devastation of wwii is shown all too well , with the annihilated cities you traverse , and the bombed - out countryside . the gritty graphics are sharp and dramatic , and look exceptional . the player models and the weapons all look authentic , and treyarch have done an exceptional job of delivering a campaign which is as hard - hitting as that from call of duty 4 : modern warfare , which is quite a feat considering the difficult task of working with actual historic events .\', \'you will find yourself playing cat and mouse with german snipers in the east , and battling frenzied japanese soldiers in the pacific who yell “banzai” as they charge you down with their bayonets . this is another area where treyarch have done a fantastic job , creating believable ai for both the german and the japanese soldiers . both react completely differently to one another , and both require different fighting styles to combat . with the japanese , you will be watching trees and shrubs for hidden soldiers just waiting to pick you off . the germans are more reserved and will rarely simply charge you , preferring to stay behind cover than expose themselves . it truly is refreshing for a wwii shooter to present the war in the pacific so authentically . there are even flame - throwers , which you can use to light up fields where japanese soldiers might be hiding . the flame - thrower is accurately modelled and it is a useful tool for burning out japanese defences , although it is a shame that it isn’t available in the multiplayer as well .\', \'each level is woven with historic film footage to help introduce the player to the different campaigns and stages during the war . this helps bring the game into context , and gives it a sense of seriousness that previous titles in the series haven’t necessarily had . several instances will show you the true dark side of the war , for example when a group of german soldiers surrender and beg for their lives , and the soviet soldiers burn them with their molotov cocktails .\', \'this game shows brutality on all sides , and is quite intense at times . it unleashed some emotional moments that we certainly haven’t experienced in very many titles to date .\', \'the single - player is a truly solid experience , with a compelling story told in an emotional and moving fashion , and our only real complaint is that it is a bit short , clocking in at around six to eight hours , similar to the single player for call of duty 4 : modern warfare . considering the massive multiplayer component however , we are willing to forgive . treyarch have included a co - op mode where you can play through the main campaign either co - operatively or competitively with up to four friends .\', \'the multiplayer is where call of duty : world at war truly shines . as it is based on the call of duty 4 : modern warfare engine there is considerable similarity with the predecessor , on almost every level . a large number of multiplayer options are there for the player to enjoy , and these are unlocked as you progress through the online ranks , gaining experience as you complete challenges and use a range of weapons . the options mirror those available in call of duty 4 : modern warfare , and include your normal team deathmatch , as well as capture the flag , capturing and holding strategic points , along with a number of others .\', \'as you advance in the ranks perks are unlocked , which give you unique abilities such as being able to seek out enemy explosives , or being able to heal a downed enemy ( provided they have the same perk ) . you can choose three perks for a game from a few categories , and choosing the right combination for your playing style can be tricky , but it certainly pays to try them out .\', \'the range of game modes available is excellent , meaning there is diverse multiplayer fun to be had , particularly when you get a good group of friends together and can game with them all night . all these modes wouldn’t be worth the virtual media they are printed on without some decent maps to compliment them , and treyarch have certainly delivered these . the maps are fantastic , and again span from the pacific , to eastern europe , to berlin . they range in sizes depending on the game modes you are playing , and it is great fun simply exploring them . as was the case with call of duty 4 : modern warfare , as you go on kill streaks you are rewarded , at three kills with a recon plane , at five kills with a bombardment , and at seven kills with attack dogs . these dogs are truly ferocious and will seek out the enemy soldiers with prompt efficiency . too often have i been taken down by dogs in their volumes , and it is truly a clever way to adapt the call of duty 4 system to the wwii setting .\', \'treyarch have also included the ability for you to single out games in your locale , meaning the games you will join will have a far lower latency . this is an option that should be in every single game , but is rarely implemented . thanks to this , all the games we had managed excellent connections , and as more local players come online it can only get better . but if it is so similar to the predecessor , is it worth it ? yes ! the new environments and the tweaks have made it an even stronger showing , and the change of scenery will surely have most fans rejoice . also the ability to jump into tanks on some of the levels adds a whole new element , with perks for vehicles as well increasing things like reload times , or turret spin speeds .\', \'as a bonus in the single player , on completion you unlock a game mode called “nacht der untoten” which is night of the dead in german . in this mode you will be barricaded in a house , either on your own or in co - op mode with up to 3 friends . as the game progresses hordes of nazi zombies will attempt to breach the barricades and make their way into the house . your goal is to destroy them wave after wave , and as you do you collect money which can be used to reinforce the barricades and purchase more powerful weapons , as well as to retreat further into the house if your positions are compromised . this is an exciting mode with some exceptional atmospheric sounds , and manages to be a real treat without feeling even remotely tacked on .\', ""the sound effects are spectacular , from the eerie whistling noise that incoming artillery shells make , or the whistle of bullets in the air and the sound of gunfire , they \' re all well implemented . the single player is accompanied by an excellent musical score that really adds to the experience , and makes call of duty : world at war an inspired effort ."", \'one might well assume that call of duty : world at war is simply a new coat of paint over a call of duty 4 powerhouse , however that would be doing treyarch a gross injustice , for their hard work has created an experience that is unique and different , although the saying “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” certainly does ring true here . the graphics and character models are sharp and impressive , the environments look great and the story plays very well with some dramatic and emotional moments . the multiplayer is up to par with the predecessor , if not even somewhat improved making this one of the best all - round gaming experiences of the year .\', \'if call of duty 4 is anything to go by ( and we’d say it is ) people will be playing call of duty : world at war for some years to come , and it is definitely worth the investment .\', \'based on the fabulous call of duty 4 : modern warfare engine . spectacular multiplayer , and the option to search for games locally . excellent change of scenery to wwii , very solid single -

playing game where the player takes control of a group of characters exploring the fictional city of sumaru . the camera follows the party from an adjustable angled overhead perspective . the city in general is navigated using an overworld map . a key element to the story and gameplay is the rumor system : after the characters hear a rumor , they can spread that rumor around the city using certain characters , and those rumors can grant the characters special items or other positive or negative effects . battles consist of both story - related boss fights and random encounters with standard enemies . battles are turn - based , with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions . once the player has laid out their strategy in the battle menu , the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for one side or the player pauses the action to change strategies . instead of the grid - based battle system from the original persona , party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn , rather than being restricted by their placement on the field . during battle , players cast spells using an assigned persona : each spell drains a character ' s spell point meter . each persona has different elemental strengths and weaknesses , and different personas can be used for defense , healing or elemental attacks . while a persona is originally quite weak , if it is used enough , it will achieve a higher rank , with rank 8 being the highest possible . as the persona ' s rank is raised , that persona is able to cast more powerful spells . in addition to individual actions , the player can align characters to trigger a fusion spell : when two or more party members use a certain sequence of spells , they will automatically summon multiple personas to generate a powerful attack . during battles , both characters and personas earn experience points . the player has the option to activate an auto - battle option , having combat play out without player interaction . during battle , the player can converse with enemies , though they are restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original persona . if the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character , it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card ( a tarot card linked to one of the arcanum or family of personas ) , which can be used to create personas in a location called the velvet room . in the velvet room , the player can summon a new persona that belongs to a spell card ' s particular persona family group . as a character gains experience levels , more powerful personas from a spell card ' s group become available . in addition to pre - set spell cards , the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation . these blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen persona family .",persona 2 : eternal punishment,"['doctype html\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: World at War Review -

While the weapons and tactics may differ, it\'s still about chaos and fear and the overwhelming of the senses as adrenaline surges through your veins. That\'s a hard experience to capture on a screen, but the Call of Duty series comes close thanks to its constant redefinition of what ""11"" is in terms of intensity for first-person shooters. Last year\'s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare delivered an awesome and varied single-player experience that was matched with an even better multiplayer suite, and it made for some really big shoes for Call of Duty: World at War to fill.\n\n\n\nIf you\'ve been living in Antarctica the past year and haven\'t heard, then yes, World at War returns back to the series\' World War II roots. This has caused no end of grumbling from fans of Modern Warfare\'s contemporary setting, as well as the fact that this installment was done by Treyarch , a sister-studio to Call of Duty-creator Infinity Ward. Treyarch did the somewhat-maligned Call of Duty 3, but the studio looks to atone for that by delivering a game with an impressive amount of content. There\'s a solid single-player campaign, co-op play, a huge multiplayer suite, and even a fun, silly mode featuring zombies.\n\n\n\nVideo Review - Watch or download here (HD available).\n\n\n\nIt certainly helps that World at War focuses on the less popularized theaters of World War II. Instead of serving up Normandy and D-Day for what would have been the umpteenth time for World War II shooters, the game covers the island hopping campaign in the Pacific as well as the Red Army\'s reversal of the tide at Stalingrad all the way to the Fall of Berlin. This provides some interesting new battlefields set on sun-bleached coral atolls in the Pacific. You will see some more familiar spots with the bombed-out cities and farmlands ofthe Eastern Front missions, but it\'s still well done.\n\n\n\nWar tends to be a savage affair, but the Pacific and the Eastern Front were especially so. In the game, Japanese soldiers swarm out of the brush, erupting out of spider holes to charge straight at you in an attempt to run you through with their bayonets. They\'ll play dead and wait for you to walk into the middle of a trap. Though set outdoors, it feels like close-quarters combat much of the time. Meanwhile, the Russian Front is full of merciless moments; there\'s plenty of gunning down of wounded and unarmed soldiers by both sides, and sometimes you\'re asked to pull the trigger yourself.\n\n\n\nWar is hell. Again.\n\n\n\nThis remains a Call of Duty game through and through. What that means is that the action is fast and fluid, as well as rigidly scripted. The success of the franchise proves that there\'s a vast audience for that, and this won\'t change anyone\'s mind. Enemy soldiers and your computer-controlled teammates respawn endlessly until you advance far enough to hit the triggers to make them stop reappearing. Then you advance to the next firefight and repeat the process over again. The thing is, you\'re far too busy shooting and ducking and dying to really notice much of the time. The sense of immersion is pretty complete.\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of deafening, large-scale set-piece battles, but there\'s also variation to change things up. Case in point is the PBY mission, where you man the guns on a Navy aircraft. At first glance, this seems to be a mirror to the Spectre Gunship mission in Modern Warfare; in both missions you rain fire down from above. But the Spectre Gunship mission has a cold detachment to it; those tiny blips on the screen that are human beings die from a foe that they cannot see and fight back against. In World at War\'s PBY mission, you\'re in the midst of a raging air and sea battle, taking damage and fighting for your life. Or there\'s a sniper mission to whack a German general that doesn\'t quite have the cat-and-mouse feeling of Modern Warfare\'s sniper level.\n\n\n\nTanks are in one Russian level.\n\n\n\nThe campaign does suffer a bit due to its broad scope; the narrative skips over months at a time, showcasing the major battles of the war. The result is that the sense of story doesn\'t seem as strong as it did in Modern Warfare. It probably doesn\'t help that we all know how the war eventually turned out; Modern Warfare had the advantage of a fictionalized story with plenty of shocking twists and turns.\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNext »\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\nSpider-Man: A History of Every Costume in the PS4 Game\n\n\n\nEvery TV Show Canceled So Far This Year\n\n\n\nPUBG for Xbox One Review\n\n\n\nWhy Predator Is the Most Subversive Action Movie of the 1980s\n\n\n\nNHL 19 Review\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider Review\n\n\n\nGwyneth Paltrow Posts Behind-the-Scenes Photos of Avengers 4\n\n\n\nThe Predator Ending Explained\n\n\n\n© 1996-2018 Ziff Davis, LLC\n\n\n\nJoin the IGN Newsletter\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nAdChoices\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY .\n\n\n\n×', 'html\n\n\n\nPCWorld - News, tips and reviews from the experts on PCs, Windows, and more\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n▲\n\n\n\nLearn more about PCWorld\'s Digital Editions\n\n\n\n\uf610 \uf611 \uf613 \uf630 ?\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nHow-To\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\n\nTablets\n\n\n\nSmartphones\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\n\nGadgets\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\nPCs\n\n\n\nSmartphones\n\n\n\nPrinters\n\n\n\nUltrabooks\n\n\n\nBlogs\n\n\n\nViruses\n\n\n\nCameras\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\n\nComputer Accessories\n\n\n\nConsumer Advice\n\n\n\nDigital Assistants\n\n\n\nDisplays\n\n\n\nE-readers\n\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\n\nHard Drives\n\n\n\nHome Theater\n\n\n\nInput Devices\n\n\n\nKeyboards\n\n\n\nLaptop Accessories\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\n\nOperating Systems\n\n\n\nOptical Drives\n\n\n\nProcessors\n\n\n\nServer Hardware\n\n\n\nSmartwatches\n\n\n\nStreaming Services\n\n\n\nStorage\n\n\n\nTablets\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\nNvidia Turing GPU deep dive: What\'s inside the radical GeForce RTX 2080 Ti\n\n\n\nDell G7 15: A six-core gaming laptop that won’t break the bank\n\n\n\nHere\'s every feature Apple might copy from the PC for the updated MacBook Air 13\n\n\n\niPhone Xs and Xs Max vs Galaxy Note 9: $1,000 phablet spec showdown\n\n\n\nHow the 32-core Ryzen Threadripper is suddenly a lot better at gaming\n\n\n\nBring back the headphone jack: Why USB-C audio still doesn\'t work\n\n\n\nSandisk Extreme Portable SSD: Classy, practical, and speedy USB 3.1 Gen 2 storage\n\n\n\nDestiny 2: Forsaken impressions: The grind returns\n\n\n\nGiveaway: Win a Scuf Gaming controller featuring PCWorld colors!\n\n\n\nHow memory bandwidth is killing AMD\'s 32-core Threadripper performance\n\n\n\nNewton\'s shutdown means Windows users are losing the only good email app (it\'s not...\n\n\n\nLatest Video\n\n\n\nSee All Video\n\n\n\nThreadripper memory bandwidth, Athlon returns, external processors, Q&A; | The Full Nerd Ep. 66\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9 photo test vs Oppo Find X, HTC U12+ & Huawei P20 Pro | Last Cam Standing XIV\n\n\n\nCheck out Dell\'s cheapest XPS 13 yet: The 9370 is just $900\n\n\n\nHow to make your own font with Microsoft Font Maker\n\n\n\nHands-on with the Asus ROG Zephysus S and ROG Strix SCAR II\n\n\n\nAMD 2nd Gen Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX review\n\n\n\nThe parts are here!

""It was the most destructive and deadliest conflict in human history."" It\'s an odd way to end a game that spends most of its time being a balls-out action game, as if the developers felt an obligation to show some reverence to its source material but weren\'t sure how.\n\n\n\nIn a way, that could be a metaphor for\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: World at War\n\n\n\n. Developed by\n\n\n\nTreyarch\n\n\n\n(and not series creator Infinity Ward), the game mostly succeeds in using the brilliant\n\n\n\nCoD4: Modern Warfare\n\n\n\nas a starting point and building a very solid WW2 shooter around it. The game stumbles in a few odd places, as if\n\n\n\nTreyarch\n\n\n\nstudied the\n\n\n\nCoD\n\n\n\nformula up and down but weren\'t quite sure how to pull it off, but the game\'s multiplayer offerings, including a fantastic co-op mode, make it more than worth a tour of duty.\n\n\n\nIn returning to World War II,\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: World at War\n\n\n\njumps back and forth between two campaigns. The first marks the series\' first visit to the Pacific theater, with the Americans fighting the Japanese through Peleliu and Okinawa. The game then jumps to Europe, where you play a Russian soldier making his way to a climactic push on Berlin. Then things ping-pong back and forth between the two campaigns until each reaches its completion.\n\n\n\nThe Pacific campaign casts you as American soldier Pvt. Miller. In keeping with the series\' ""no one fights alone"" motto, you\'re always fighting as part of a larger unit, led by one Sgt. Roebuck (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland). Pitched as having a more ""mature"" tone, the first mission starts with you being held captive as a fellow soldier gets his throat cut in front of your eyes. Of course, you\'re rescued at the last second, and off you go on what\'s best described as a typical\n\n\n\nCall of Duty\n\n\n\nadventure, with the usual mix of large-scale firefights and scripted sequences that make you feel like you\'re in the middle of a WW2 action movie.\n\n\n\nThe basic combat model remains unchanged from previous games, which is a very good thing. Long-gone is the traditional health bar: When you\'re hit by gunfire, the screen blurs and shakes for a second before returning to normal. Stand out in the open and take too much damage and you\'ll eventually die; take cover for a few seconds and you\'ll be good as new. It can\'t be overstated how effective this is in improving the pace of a shooter, where combat and tactics are the focus instead of scrounging for health and armor packs.\n\n\n\nNext:\n\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n\n>>\n\n\n\nPage:\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nLatest Reviews\n\n\n\nImpire Review\n\n\n\n(Feb 20, 2013)\n\n\n\nCrysis 3 Review\n\n\n\n(Feb 19, 2013)\n\n\n\nDead Space 3 Review\n\n\n\n(Feb 16, 2013)\n\n\n\nSpecial Forces: Team X Review\n\n\n\n(Feb 14, 2013)\n\n\n\nAliens: Colonial Marines Review\n\n\n\n(Feb 12, 2013)\n\n\n\n::\n\n\n\nMore Reviews...\n\n\n\nFollow GameSpy on Twitter\n\n\n\nGet the Latest in Gaming News\n\n\n\nAround the Network\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: World at... at IGN\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: World at...

It provides a refreshing change to the well known maps and weapons from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and makes some positive changes. The single-player campaign involves a riveting and emotional story, and the inclusion of co-op is fantastic. The game itself however is heavily weighted towards multiplayer, as was its predecessor.\n\n\n\nJoel Lauterbach\n\n\n\n17 November 2008, 12:35 pm\n\n\n\nReviewed on\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nCall of Duty is possibly one of the biggest names in the first person shooter genre.\n\n\n\nVery few people will not have heard of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare , and there are many people out there extremely skilled in the online multiplayer.\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: World at War has large boots to fill, and anticipation is high. Can the new title live up to the hype, and has Treyarch finally pulled a truly epic shooter out of their hat?\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: World at War has taken the Call of Duty series back to World War Two once again. It's been several years since we had a decent WWII shooter (although Brothers in Arms caught our attention a few weeks back) so it's a real pleasure to go back to this time, particularly since Call of Duty: World at War takes the player across several combat theatres.\n\n\n\nBattles take place in the Pacific, Eastern Europe, and of course Berlin, all the way into the Reichstag. This variation in scenery really spices up the title, as few games have given us a taste of what war in the Pacific entailed. Call of Duty: World at War puts you in the shoes of Soviet and US soldiers, and although it would be nice to have been able to play an ANZAC soldier or similar, the worldwide appeal is no doubt greater for the others.\n\n\n\nBeing based on a modified Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare engine, the game looks and plays fabulously, just as its predecessor did. The environments look stunning, and there were moments that truly filled us with awe, for example standing in the middle of the Reichstag in front of the Reichs Adler, or under its massive, partially destroyed glass roof . It certainly felt as though we were there. The destruction and devastation of WWII is shown all too well, with the annihilated cities you traverse, and the bombed-out countryside. The gritty graphics are sharp and dramatic, and look exceptional. The player models and the weapons all look authentic, and Treyarch have done an exceptional job of delivering a campaign which is as hard-hitting as that from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare , which is quite a feat considering the difficult task of working with actual historic events.\n\n\n\nYou will find yourself playing cat and mouse with German snipers in the East, and battling frenzied Japanese soldiers in the Pacific who yell “banzai” as they charge you down with their bayonets. This is another area where Treyarch have done a fantastic job, creating believable AI for both the German and the Japanese soldiers. Both react completely differently to one another, and both require different fighting styles to combat. With the Japanese, you will be watching trees and shrubs for hidden soldiers just waiting to pick you off. The Germans are more reserved and will rarely simply charge you, preferring to stay behind cover than expose themselves. It truly is refreshing for a WWII shooter to present the war in the Pacific so authentically. There are even flame-throwers, which you can use to light up fields where Japanese soldiers might be hiding. The flame-thrower is accurately modelled and it is a useful tool for burning out Japanese defences, although it is a shame that it isn’t available in the multiplayer as well.\n\n\n\nEach level is woven with historic film footage to help introduce the player to the different campaigns and stages during the war. This helps bring the game into context, and gives it a sense of seriousness that previous titles in the series haven’t necessarily had. Several instances will show you the true dark side of the war, for example when a group of German soldiers surrender and beg for their lives, and the Soviet soldiers burn them with their Molotov cocktails.\n\n\n\nThis game shows brutality on all sides, and is quite intense at times. It unleashed some emotional moments that we certainly haven’t experienced in very many titles to date.\n\n\n\nThe single-player is a truly solid experience, with a compelling story told in an emotional and moving fashion, and our only real complaint is that it is a bit short, clocking in at around six to eight hours, similar to the single player for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare . Considering the massive multiplayer component however, we are willing to forgive. Treyarch have included a co-op mode where you can play through the main campaign either co-operatively or competitively with up to four friends.\n\n\n\nThe multiplayer is where Call of Duty: World at War truly shines. As it is based on the Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare engine there is considerable similarity with the predecessor, on almost every level. A large number of multiplayer options are there for the player to enjoy, and these are unlocked as you progress through the online ranks, gaining experience as you complete challenges and use a range of weapons. The options mirror those available in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare , and include your normal team deathmatch, as well as capture the flag, capturing and holding strategic points, along with a number of others.\n\n\n\nAs you advance in the ranks perks are unlocked, which give you unique abilities such as being able to seek out enemy explosives, or being able to heal a downed enemy (provided they have the same perk). You can choose three perks for a game from a few categories, and choosing the right combination for your playing style can be tricky, but it certainly pays to try them out.\n\n\n\nThe range of game modes available is excellent, meaning there is diverse multiplayer fun to be had, particularly when you get a good group of friends together and can game with them all night. All these modes wouldn’t be worth the virtual media they are printed on without some decent maps to compliment them, and Treyarch have certainly delivered these. The maps are fantastic, and again span from the Pacific, to Eastern Europe, to Berlin. They range in sizes depending on the game modes you are playing, and it is great fun simply exploring them. As was the case with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare , as you go on kill streaks you are rewarded, at three kills with a recon plane, at five kills with a bombardment, and at seven kills with attack dogs. These dogs are truly ferocious and will seek out the enemy soldiers with prompt efficiency. Too often have I been taken down by dogs in their volumes, and it is truly a clever way to adapt the Call of Duty 4 system to the WWII setting.\n\n\n\nTreyarch have also included the ability for you to single out games in your locale, meaning the games you will join will have a far lower latency. This is an option that should be in every single game, but is rarely implemented. Thanks to this, all the games we had managed excellent connections, and as more local players come online it can only get better. But if it is so similar to the predecessor, is it worth it? Yes! The new environments and the tweaks have made it an even stronger showing, and the change of scenery will surely have most fans rejoice. Also the ability to jump into tanks on some of the levels adds a whole new element, with perks for vehicles as well increasing things like reload times, or turret spin speeds.\n\n\n\nAs a bonus in the single player, on completion you unlock a game mode called “Nacht der Untoten” which is Night of the Dead in German. In this mode you will be barricaded in a house, either on your own or in co-op mode with up to 3 friends. As the game progresses hordes of Nazi zombies will attempt to breach the barricades and make their way into the house. Your goal is to destroy them wave after wave, and as you do you collect money which can be used to reinforce the barricades and purchase more powerful weapons, as well as to retreat further into the house if your positions are compromised. This is an exciting mode with some exceptional atmospheric sounds, and manages to be a real treat without feeling even remotely tacked on.\n\n\n\nThe sound effects are spectacular, from the eerie whistling noise that incoming artillery shells make, or the whistle of bullets in the air and the sound of gunfire, they're all well implemented. The single player is accompanied by an excellent musical score that really adds to the experience, and makes Call of Duty: World at War an inspired effort.\n\n\n\nOne might well assume that Call of Duty: World at War is simply a new coat of paint over a Call of Duty 4 powerhouse, however that would be doing Treyarch a gross injustice, for their hard work has created an experience that is unique and different, although the saying “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” certainly does ring true here. The graphics and character models are sharp and impressive, the environments look great and the story plays very well with some dramatic and emotional moments. The multiplayer is up to par with the predecessor, if not even somewhat improved making this one of the best all-round gaming experiences of the year.\n\n\n\nIf Call of Duty 4 is anything to go by (and we’d say it is) people will be playing Call of Duty: World at War for some years to come, and it is definitely worth the investment.\n\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n“Superb!”\n\n\n\nUps\n\n\n\nBased on the fabulous Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare engine. Spectacular multiplayer, and the option to search for games locally. Excellent change of scenery to WWII, very solid single-player. Co-op.\n\n\n\nDowns\n\n\n\nSingle-player a little short, WWII setting won't appeal to all. Weighted very much towards online play (if this can be considered a bad thing).\n\n\n\nReview scores are provided as a rough guide only.

The camera follows the party from an adjustable angled overhead perspective. The city in general is navigated using an overworld map. A key element to the story and gameplay is the Rumor system: after the characters hear a rumor, they can spread that rumor around the city using certain characters, and those rumors can grant the characters special items or other positive or negative effects.Battles consist of both story-related boss fights and random encounters with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player has laid out their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for one side or the player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.During battle, players cast spells using an assigned Persona: each spell drains a character's Spell Point meter. Each Persona has different elemental strengths and weaknesses, and different Personas can be used for defense, healing or elemental attacks. While a Persona is originally quite weak, if it is used enough, it will achieve a higher rank, with Rank 8 being the highest possible. As the Persona's rank is raised, that Persona is able to cast more powerful spells. In addition to individual actions, the player can align characters to trigger a Fusion Spell: when two or more party members use a certain sequence of spells, they will automatically summon multiple Personas to generate a powerful attack. During battles, both characters and Personas earn experience points. The player has the option to activate an Auto-battle option, having combat play out without player interaction.During battle, the player can converse with enemies, though they are restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked to one of the Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family.",Persona 2: Eternal Punishment,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_2:_Eternal_Punishment
45521,DEVICE 6,iOS,device 6,"['[\'device 6 ( $ 3 . 99 ) is the newest project from developer simogo — an independent team that has quickly risen to the cream of the crop among ios developers . but you won’t find endless runners or dual - stick shooters in their repertoire — with games like 2012’s beat sneak bandit ( $ 2 . 99 ) and this year’s year walk ( $ 3 . 99 ) , simogo has shown that they know how to utilize the platform’s strengths like few others are doing . in device 6 , simogo brings that same relentless ambition to the genre of interactive fiction and crafts an experience unlike any other i’ve encountered on ios .\', \'device 6 starts out with an old cinema - like opening credit scene — an artistic sentiment you’ll come across time and time again throughout the adventure . before you know it , you begin the first chapter and start moving through the text , which reads like a mix between a classic mystery novel and a b - movie thriller . you play as a girl named anna who wakes up in a mysterious room that appears to be part of some kind of large castle of sorts . as you read through the text , you follow anna from one creepy room to another , in search of the meaning behind the castle and why she is there .\', \'the rooms that are described in the text are separated from each other in some pretty creative ways that keep the player engaged throughout , whether it’s something as simple as flipping the text upside down or falling down stair steps of words . but the real action happens in the pictures , which are like little windows into the world that the text describes . they move in parallax with the scrolling of the text — which is a nifty little trick for revealing the rooms to players slowly with an added sense of suspense . these windows are also often where the game’s puzzles take place , often times giving the player toggles to switch through or even just an important piece of information .\', \'the puzzles in device 6 aren’t terribly innovative , but they do take a significant amount of focus to complete . by forcing the player to reread every single bit of text and pay attention to every sound , they achieve the goal of getting the player to pour over and appreciate every detail of the game’s writing and design . it does take a bit of time to adjust to the kinds of observations device 6 asks you to make , but it’s exciting to know that any detail could be a clue that opens up the next chapter of the story .\', \'to pile on more compliments to the design of device 6 , the various sounds and bits of music sprinkled throughout really add to the immersion of the story . the sound design of the game takes what would otherwise be an interesting piece of interactive fiction and transforms it into a full game experience — one that might even send a few shivers down your spine on occasion . each sound effect is meticulously crafted , down to the old distorted recordings or even anna’s quiet footsteps as she walks through the eerie old castle . as the game advises , get a decent pair of headphones and let the sounds immerse you in the mystery .\', \'i understand that there are plenty of arguments to be made for why device 6 is in fact not a game at all . after all , the game is mostly text and features very little of what we traditionally refer to as “gameplay” . and while there is a strange scoring and feedback system built in , it was the only feature that felt a little out of place here . regardless of what you want to call device 6 , one thing is for sure : if you’re at all open - minded , you’re sure to be creeped out , entertained , and thoroughly delighted by its inventive approach to interactive storytelling . trust me — once you finish chapter six , you’ll be thinking about this one for weeks .\', \'idle , easy with rich gameplay . taptap heroes is the best choice !\', \'win $ 15 - fortnite quiz app . itunes gift card or payal . . . your choice !\', \'hole - in - one golf ( by edevgames , inc . )\', ""toucharcade covers the latest games and apps for apple \' s iphone and ipod touch . we are the largest site dedicated to iphone and ipod touch gaming ."", \'some xenforo functionality crafted by audentio design .\']', '[\'one thing’s for sure : simogo has no shortage of creativity or ambition . their last game ,\', \', was a swedish folklore - inspired horror adventure with an insane companion app that went well beyond explaining the characters and symbols used in the game . device 6 , their latest game , is a more focused title , but no less original . it’s also a fantastic reading and gaming experience .\', \'to dive too deeply into the content of device 6 would start to eat away at the game’s surprise and charm . so if you want a “clean read” of the game , go ahead and buy it now . it’s worth it . it’s awesome .\', \'still here ? i won’t spoil anything for you , but here are some broad strokes about what device 6 is . mostly what you do in this game is read . this novella - length tale tells the story of a woman who wakes up trapped in a room , and goes on from there , using a “house of leaves” - style branching text that’s full of mysteries and curiosities . often you’ll have to turn your ios device left and right to follow the labyrinthine sentences along the page .\', \'the story is also dotted with cryptic illustrations , videos , and audio , some of which are interactive . these act as puzzles that , once solved , let you progress further in the story . there’s little in the way of explanation for how to solve the puzzles , so you’ll have to pay attention as you read , and keep your eyes peeled for clues . i only got very stuck once , but most of the puzzles are tough enough to make you feel smart for solving them .\', \'to explain more about device 6 would do it a disservice . i enjoyed the story / game a lot , and can easily recommend it to anyone interested in diving into a moody mystery .\', ""enter your email to subscribe to our daily email on what \' s hot in mobile games . or , take a look at"", ""and it of course should go without saying , but we \' ll say it just to make it 100 % clear - - we will never share your email address with anyone ."", \'the fine folks at milkbag games have released sidewords . a fun little diversion of a word game that is the devil child of crosswords and scrabble . for each level in the game the grid must be completed to win the level — this means that each letter at the top and side must be used . and not just the top or side , but each word must be made up of letters from the top and side to create a grid . it’s a pain , but in the right kind of way . even the simplest of the levels can be a head scratcher until you get used to the game . well worth the $ 3 as a diversion while we wait for milkbag to finally release snow siege .\', \'we’d like to thank our sponsor for this week , zap zap kindergarten math .\', \'it’s not always easy to tear your kids away from their tablets and make them do something edifying . thankfully , zap zap kindergarten math relieves you of this task by turning mathematics into a fun touchscreen video game . win win !\', \'aimed at children 3 - 6 years old , the app makes math fun by ‘gamifying’ it , turning simple mathematics problems into little challenges so that your pre - schooler can learn and play at the same time .\', \'there are more than two dozen mini - games , split across three categories : numbers , shapes and measurements , and add and subtract . according to the developer the difficulty of these puzzles is adaptive too , so kids of any ability can be both encouraged and challenged .\', \'mini dayz has launched and it’s a pixelated 2 . 5d open world that’s as brutal as the desktop version . in this game , the player is dumped on shore with nothing . they must scavenge around for food , water , and weapons while avoiding attack . it’s the kind of game where the goal is to stay alive as long as possible . but that will never be very long . it’s oddly free and seems to only have an ad on the main screen — for now .\', \'pewter games has brought their charming point and click adventure the little acre to ios . it’s an amazingly beautiful animated adventure set in a sort of hybrid magical / alien world . a great all ages adventure and very fun .\', \'we’d like to thank our sponsor for this week , the house of da vinci by blue brain games . there’s a reason leonardo da vinci is the only renaissance figure who routinely shows up in video games you know . with his remarkable inventiveness and genius for creative problem - solving , da vinci was a gamer through and through . he was just born 500 hundred years too soon . thankfully , there are studios like blue brain games to bring him to life in videogame form . the house of da vinci , which comes to us courtesy of a hugely successful kickstarter campaign , is a puzzler that seeks to channel the artistry and innovation of its title character .\', \'you play as one of da vinci’s more promising apprentices , and you have the challenging task of trying to work out where the hell he’s gone . was he assassinated by the church ?

reading the text , and starring at the images time after time , and then there’s a whole other audio component to contend with . you will want to set aside time in a quiet place to decipher the clues within device 6 , and playing with headphones can make your skin crawl at times in this creepy mystery . every single part of the app is designed to put you in the main character’s shoes to see what she sees , hear what she hears , and think what she thinks . speaking of design , the production values of device 6 are unmatched in the app store with such a high degree of fit and finish applied to every pixel of text , and imagery . it’s amazing how much detail can come from a game that still fills a majority of the screen with blank canvas . at the end of each chapter , there’s a little twist that offers up a thought provoking question and answer segment that masquerades as though you’re at a testing facility when analyzing this story . the story itself is incredible in its own right , and the text in a plain word document would be compelling enough on its own . it’s taken to the next level with the layout , eerie imagery , and timely audio sequences . you end up hanging on every word , especially since you need to find the hidden clues to solve specific puzzles to complete a chapter .\', \'this is the type of experience that you want to savor every moment of , because on one side you want to figure out the conclusion , but on the other you don’t want it to end . it’s truly remarkable in every regard , and simgo has done an excellent job in building upon what they started with year walk , and the even more mysterious companion app . there’s simply nothing like it in the app store , or on any platform for that matter . once you get started , it will encompass your thoughts whether it’s the thought provoking puzzles , or the mysterious storyline that very slowly unfolds into even more off shooting mysteries . part of the enjoyment is just trying to figure out what exactly is going on to the main character . the only drawback is that the puzzles can be quite mind - bending , which can leave you completely stumped , and if that happens there’s no way forward . there’s no optional hint system , so you’re left on a sequence that you have no clue what to do with . that really comes with the territory though , and you need to understand what you’re getting yourself into . this game will challenge you , but it’s oh so rewarding when a chapter clicks into place , and that feeling is rarely duplicated .\', \'device 6 ( $ 3 . 99 , universal ) is an absolute must buy that is an experience not to be missed , as you will end up appreciating every minute with . it’s completely engrossing in every regard , and it’s just so finely made to truly put you in the shoes of the protagonist , and get your mind racing just like hers . it’s an all new art form in all honesty that is unlike anything else you have ever experienced , and it’s such a rewarding undertaking that you will remember long after it’s done . give yourself this treat , you deserve it .\', \'click here to cancel reply .\', \'you must be logged in to post a comment .\', \'after apple watch series 4 , apple came to the star of the sh . . .\', ""the apple watch launched three years ago , and yet we \' re alre . . ."", \'gather round event : meet the 6 . 1″ lcd iphone xr\', \'apple had a third new iphone to unveil today , the iphone xr . . .\', ""panasonic has been at every ces since the show \' s inception , . . ."", \'one of the new additions to icloud and itunes was itunes mat . . .\', ""applenapps offers the most current , critical , concise , and consistent app reviews around . we are the definitive resource for the latest and greatest iphone app reviews , ipad app reviews , and itouch game reviews . we also provide current apple news and editorials . we try to bring you the highest quality articles on everything apple \' n \' apps , as well as recommendations of other items in the apple universe ."", ""we strive to bring insightful and thought provoking articles in an attempt to be more than just another news aggregator . our site \' s coverage extends to everything apple \' n \' app related , but our primary focus is on the cross section of the two ."", \'thanks for visiting , and we hope you enjoy .\', \'copyright © 2014 -

fictional references and sometimes trying to make their point rather bluntly . the other edge of the sword is that it’s kind of nice to know that this is a game whose puzzles and messages are not hidden in obscurity .\', \'is there to be discovered . and that’s the thing that’s so great about it : there’s little else like it . it’s a story , but one that takes advantage of sound and visuals , and being on a touchscreen device rather than just ink on paper .\', \'device 6 ’s emotional response may not be as affecting as year walk was for me , and the depth of replayability is certainly more obscured than year walk was , if it does exist ( i haven’t quite figured it out yet ! ) . but device 6 was engrossing for the entire time that i played it , and give it my highest recommendation . simogo’s doing something few others are doing , and it’s wonderful that someone is both providing great experiences and testing the limits of interactive media .\', \'review disclosure : note that the product reviewed on this page may have been provided to us by the developer for the purposes of this review . note that if the developer provides the product or not , this does not impact the review or score .\', \'would you like your application reviewed on 148apps ? see the about page for information .\', \'featured in pc magazine top 100 sites of 2009 in upcoming tech sites .\', \'note rush ( music reading flashca . . .\', ""little children \' s educational sw . . ."", \'preschool all in one basic skill . . .\', \'socratic -

together feel ."", \'the x - men are back ! well . . . a select few of them , anyway .\', ""x - men seems to follow the basic plot concepts of the x - men movies , but it centers its focus around three of the heroes : wolverine , nightcrawler , and iceman . whether this was a deliberate choice , or a direct response to which of the film \' s actors activision could actually get to reprise their roles for the game ( hugh jackman , alan cumming , and shawn ashmore are indeed in the game ) , we \' ll likely never know , but nightcrawler \' s inclusion is specifcally to explain why he \' s not in the new movie . for what it \' s worth , jackman , cumming , and ashmore all do serviceable jobs voicing the characters , as does patrick stewart , who returns to voice act professor x . unfortunately , the remaining cast is mostly made up of soundalikes , and none of them are particularly good ."", ""by centering on these three characters and setting up the mission structure as the game does , you \' re left with a fairly disjointed sense of where the story is going . for instance , early on in the game , all three characters go through quick training sequences to get you familiar with how they work . the next mission is a return to alkali lake ( the site of jean grey \' s tragic demise at the end of the second film ) to recapture parts of the cerebro machine taken by general stryker . you start off as nightcrawler , and are given the option later on to play either as wolverine or nightcrawler for another section . once you \' ve made your pick , you \' re stuck with that character for the duration of his missions during this chapter ( which can go up to around three or four in a row , at times ) . only after you \' ve completed it can you switch over to the other available character . not to mention that iceman just disappears during this whole section and we don \' t join up with him until significantly later , in a completely new scenario that \' s given next to no plot exposition . it \' s not that a game of this type has to be some kind of brilliant work of fiction to succeed , but x - men tells its story in such a perplexing and disconcerting way that it \' s difficult to care much about what \' s going on ."", \'each of the three playable characters fights a little differently from the other . wolverine obviously has his adamantium claws , as well as a rage ability that gives him some particularly brutal moves ; nightcrawler can teleport to any area within his visual range , as well as use his teleporting abilities in combat to pull off more acrobatic moves and transport himself to a "" shadow realm "" to regenerate his health ( an ability we \\\' re not sure he ever had before this game ) ; and finally , iceman perpetually rides on an icy surfboard , flying through the air while shooting his ice beam and ice projectiles , and inexplicably regenerating his health ( an ability we \\\' re positive he didn \\\' t have before this game ) . the iceman missions are almost more like rail shooters , since you \\\' re near - constantly in motion , floating about various areas and sometimes navigating perilous traps and pitfalls - - and for that matter , the iceman missions are probably the most interesting part of the game , if only in comparison to the utterly dull nightcrawler and wolverine segments .\', ""when you \' re playing as wolverine or nightcrawler , you \' re beating up a lot of enemies in relatively closed - off environments . sometimes you need to find a control panel to open a door , and there are some platforming elements with the nightcrawler sections ( which can usually be circumvented altogether using his teleport ability ) , but for the most part you \' re just constantly fighting enemies with guns , electric sticks , electric spears , bazookas , or the occasional mutant power . plenty of beat - \' em - up games have managed to suffice with a similar formula , but x - men \' s combat is just boring . there \' s next to no combo variety to speak of , and it \' s awfully easy to just use wolverine \' s power attacks or nightcrawler \' s teleport attacks over and over again to break past an enemy \' s block to simply roll right over them over and over again . it \' s not that the fights are easy , exactly . sometimes they can actually be a bit frustrating , especially when you \' re playing as wolverine and getting pelted with bullets , and the only thing you can really do is run right at the guys with the guns . but frustration aside , there \' s nothing interesting about the fight sequences to make you want to keep playing . it \' s just button - mashing of the most banal variety ."", ""additionally , there are a number of moments in the game that make you wonder just how much time this game really spent in development . there are no major show - stopping bugs , but rather a lot of little glitches that just keep popping up over and over again . enemies will sometimes teleport from one side of a level to another instantaneously for no discernible reason ; sometimes you can knock enemies into walls or doorways from which they cannot escape ; scripted appearances of characters will sometimes get stuck and remain there even when they \' re clearly supposed to disappear moments later - - there are a lot of little things like this . boss fights also seem very poorly cobbled together . most boss fights in the game simply revolve around you and the boss character running around an enclosed area , hitting each other for a bit , then running off , hitting each other again , and then running off , and so on . the bosses just aren \' t very smart , since you can basically pelt them with attacks , run to the far side of the environment to recharge a bit , and go back without them ever really running after you , or at least not very quickly ."", ""x - men manages to deliver a pretty good visual experience , although there \' s nothing too special about it . the basic character models and animations are nicely detailed , as are a few of the environments . there are a couple of cool levels in particular , such as the power - plant - at - sundown scenario iceman takes on at one point , as well as the sequence inside the dark cerebro machine from the 2nd movie . there \' s also a fair share of rather mundane looking areas in the game , but generally speaking , it \' s a pleasant enough game to look at . the most obnoxious visual aspect of x - men , however , is its cutscenes , or practical lack thereof . all the game \' s story sequences are presented with still - frame shots of comic - book versions of the movie characters . you \' ll see these static characters awkwardly move across the screen to do various actions , and speak to one another with no mouth movement whatsoever . it doesn \' t even look so much like a comic book as it does the kind of purposely bad animation you \' d find on something like sealab 2021 , but without the purpose . every once in a while the game does go whole hog into the comic book style of transition , but it skips by each panel so fast that you can \' t read a single line of what \' s being said . as if the story weren \' t confusing enough already . . ."", ""x - men beat - \' em - ups can be great - - just look at the old x - men arcade game . if the developers had played that a few more times , maybe they \' d have come up with something better than this trite junk ."", ""there are five home system versions of x - men currently available , with iterations on the xbox , playstation 2 , gamecube , pc , and xbox 360 . the first four versions all look comparable to one another , with the xbox version perhaps looking the best of the bunch . all four really do look practically the same , but the pc , gc and ps2 versions suffer from an erratic frame rate . the xbox 360 version is actually also comparable to the other four versions - - perhaps a little too comparable . to say that on a standard - definition tv , the 360 version looks pretty close to the xbox version would be an understatement . they \' re practically identical , with only a slightly more noticeable bit of color depth apparent on the 360 version . upping to hd resolution does improve matters , especially in terms of environmental detail , but it \' s not such a huge difference as to warrant the $ 60 price tag ( as opposed to $ 40 for the other console versions , and $ 30 for the pc version ) . suffice it to say , the 360 version is pretty much a rip - off ."", ""x - men : the official game is ultimately an easily dismissible movie game to toss on the smoldering pile of other cash - in movie games released over the years . its existence is solely based on the need to have an x - men game to coincide with the hype surrounding the film , and it brings no interesting gameplay , story , visual , or feature components to the table to make it worth your time . it \' s all the more disappointing , considering that as of late , activision has done well with the x - men license with games like the x - men legends series . you \' d have to go all the way back to 2002 for something like x - men : next dimension to find a comparably lame use of the x - men license to x -

inspired sense of analysis and a novella approach to story in order to proceed throughout your adventure . put on your thinking cap , because this device 6 brings about the sleuth in us all .\', ""device 6 immediately sets itself apart from nearly every single puzzle game i have ever played on the ios format . heck , there isn \' t even a console or pc title i can think of that resembles device 6 . here \' s a rough description : take the 7th guest ( remember that ? ) , throw in sherlock holmes , an inspiring narrative , cast away , nancy drew grown up and some alfred hitchcock to boot . let it be known that device 6 is not for everyone , especially those who easily give up at puzzles . because device 6 shows a mastery of not only puzzle game mechanics themselves , but spy / detective narratives where puzzles are again at the forefront . the culminating effect was that my mind got attacked from both sides , from reading the story itself and searching back and forth throughout the text and pictures in order to find clues so i can solve the current puzzle at hand . but what simogo ingeniously does , is that they base the difficulty of the sequential levels in accordance to how fast you solved the previous level and your responses to a short survey that they give at the end of each stage . the resulting effect is that i was constantly hit sideways ; just when i thought i was easily able to figure a puzzle out , boom , device 6 drops a small detail that throws off my train of thought and forces me to re - evaluate the problem ."", \'while i have encountered my fair share of puzzle titles across the board , i have never found one as engaging , beautiful , shocking , and outright thought - provoking as device 6 . without a doubt , the swedish team that scripted this story , developed these puzzles and created their execution are prodigies in terms of game design . in terms of its actual story , device 6 acts as a piece of meta - fiction . it makes you , the player / reader , explore the text as deep as you would like . but you are only rewarded with progression if your abilities of observation , analysis and memory ( and mathematics occasionally ) are sound .\', \'device 6 starts off like a book . anna , the protagonist , wakes up in a strange mansion and has a case of amnesia . none of that is relevant , because she is locked away in this mansion and it is up to you to solve the riddles and puzzles anna encounters throughout her endeavors . but what is most impressive , is how beautifully device 6 presents this to you .\', ""at first , device 6 reads like an e - book , as if you were navigating one giant pdf file with your touchscreen . but what starts to happen is that you encounter 3d pictures scattered throughout the text , whose backgrounds and images scroll as you continue through the text , providing a large sense of depth as to what you are looking at . device 6 breaks the fourth wall in order to put you , the player , in anna \' s shoes . as anna starts descending down a ladder , the text breaks and slows down to reflect her descent , while placing audio cues perfectly reflecting this action as well . another scene similar to this is when you are scrolling through the text ( with one sentence showing up along the equator of the screen ) , and anna enters a dark room . as you scroll , a wall of black cuts off the sentence , and you are surprised with a light clicking on and a full page of text appearing on the screen out of nowhere ."", ""even more ingenious is device 6 \' s delivery of its puzzle system . here is the shortest puzzle i can describe throughout my ventures with anna - - the first one ( spoilers of the first puzzle incoming ) . anna wakes up , finds a painting of an orangutan with a number painted on its corner , presumably the year this story takes place . as you progress from room to room , anna finds that she is alone in this strange manor . she passes by a machine with a left and right button on top of it , which you see in a picture in the middle of the text and can actually push its buttons and hear them beep in response . since you do not know how this mechanism is meant to function , you must simply continue on . afterwards you pass by a warped scene containing numerous framed pictures on the wall , with each frame containing a single word . you also pass by a machine you can punch four digits into . punching in the number from the monkey picture does nothing ."", \'afterwards , anna encounters a staircase , and the text splits into two directions , depending on whether or not you go downstairs . let \\\' s say that you followed the text into the other upstairs rooms . you eventually hear a voice recording repeat itself from a speaker saying that the passcode is a combination of the number found between orange and yellow ( the orangutan \\\' s colors ) , the number found between "" hope "" and "" lies "" , and the channel the speaker is speaking from . go a little bit further , and you find a surveillance cam with one of the camera channels focused on a tape recorder . if you go back near the beginning , you will find that hope and lies are two of the framed words in the warped scene . if you pan back and forth , you can eventually find a framed number . add the orangutan number , the framed number and the tape recorder channel together , and you finally get the passcode . but the passcode isn \\\' t even the solution to the level , there is still the left and right buttoned machine to worry about . .\', ""let it be known , the only reason why device 6 did not get a perfect score is because i know that it \' s not for everyone . just when i thought i was getting used to the puzzles in device 6 , i would always encounter some form of fright or immense suspense brought on by anna \' s circumstance . this kept me thoroughly engaged and inspired me to find out how she got there , and why was this happening to her . by this point in time , i still have trouble trying to decide whether or not device 6 was a text - based game or a story with video game elements added in , but neither of those choices adequately describe it . in hindsight , i realize now that device 6 can be easily categorized with one word : art . with such idiosyncrasies , you might ask yourself should you buy it ? well , that \' s a puzzle only you can solve . but if you think you have a decent amount of problem solving skills , i will simply leave you all with a hint -

But you won’t find endless runners or dual-stick shooters in their repertoire — with games like 2012’s Beat Sneak Bandit ($2.99) and this year’s Year Walk ($3.99) , Simogo has shown that they know how to utilize the platform’s strengths like few others are doing. In Device 6 , Simogo brings that same relentless ambition to the genre of interactive fiction and crafts an experience unlike any other I’ve encountered on iOS.\n\n\n\nDevice 6 starts out with an old cinema-like opening credit scene — an artistic sentiment you’ll come across time and time again throughout the adventure. Before you know it, you begin the first chapter and start moving through the text, which reads like a mix between a classic mystery novel and a B-movie thriller. You play as a girl named Anna who wakes up in a mysterious room that appears to be part of some kind of large castle of sorts. As you read through the text, you follow Anna from one creepy room to another, in search of the meaning behind the castle and why she is there.\n\n\n\nThe rooms that are described in the text are separated from each other in some pretty creative ways that keep the player engaged throughout, whether it’s something as simple as flipping the text upside down or falling down stair steps of words. But the real action happens in the pictures, which are like little windows into the world that the text describes. They move in parallax with the scrolling of the text — which is a nifty little trick for revealing the rooms to players slowly with an added sense of suspense. These windows are also often where the game’s puzzles take place, often times giving the player toggles to switch through or even just an important piece of information.\n\n\n\nThe puzzles in Device 6 aren’t terribly innovative, but they do take a significant amount of focus to complete. By forcing the player to reread every single bit of text and pay attention to every sound, they achieve the goal of getting the player to pour over and appreciate every detail of the game’s writing and design. It does take a bit of time to adjust to the kinds of observations Device 6 asks you to make, but it’s exciting to know that any detail could be a clue that opens up the next chapter of the story.\n\n\n\nTo pile on more compliments to the design of Device 6 , the various sounds and bits of music sprinkled throughout really add to the immersion of the story. The sound design of the game takes what would otherwise be an interesting piece of interactive fiction and transforms it into a full game experience — one that might even send a few shivers down your spine on occasion. Each sound effect is meticulously crafted, down to the old distorted recordings or even Anna’s quiet footsteps as she walks through the eerie old castle. As the game advises, get a decent pair of headphones and let the sounds immerse you in the mystery.\n\n\n\nI understand that there are plenty of arguments to be made for why Device 6 is in fact not a game at all. After all, the game is mostly text and features very little of what we traditionally refer to as “gameplay”. And while there is a strange scoring and feedback system built in, it was the only feature that felt a little out of place here. Regardless of what you want to call Device 6 , one thing is for sure: If you’re at all open-minded, you’re sure to be creeped out, entertained, and thoroughly delighted by its inventive approach to interactive storytelling. Trust me — once you finish Chapter Six, you’ll be thinking about this one for weeks.\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\n\n$3.99\n\n\n\n5 stars\n\n\n\nAdventure\n\n\n\nGames\n\n\n\niPad Games\n\n\n\niPhone games\n\n\n\niPod touch games\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nPuzzle\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nUniversal\n\n\n\nDEVICE 6\n\n\n\n** Winner of Apple Design Award 2014 ** A surreal thriller in which the written word is your map, as well as your narra…\n\n\n\nTA Rating:\n\n\n\n$3.99\n\n\n\nBuy Now\n\n\n\nWatch\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\nPrevious Post\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\n\nApple Finally Gives Developers the Ability to Manage Game Center Leaderboards\n\n\n\nNext Post\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\nTiger Style Reveals New Game Through Teaser Site\n\n\n\nSupport us on Patreon\n\n\n\nGive Support\n\n\n\nJoin us on the TouchArcade Discord server\n\n\n\nSupport TouchArcade by shopping on Amazon\n\n\n\nFollow TouchArcade on Twitch to watch our playthroughs\n\n\n\nLatest Reviews\n\n\n\n‘Wall Kickers’ Review – Good Luck Kicking This Habit\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n5 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n‘Valleys Between’ Review – Finding Life’s Perfect Balance\n\n\n\n$2.99\n\n\n\n$2.99\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n4.5 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n‘Alphabear 2’ Review – Return to Great Gameplay, Puns Galore\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n4 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n‘Golfing Around’ Review – A Putting Good Time\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n$2.99\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n4 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n‘Wheely World’ Review – Wheely Average\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n2 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n‘SlimeRoom’ Review – It’s All Goo-d\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n4.5 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n‘Summit Way’ Review – We Can Build This Bridge Together\n\n\n\n$1.99\n\n\n\n$1.99\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n4.5 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n‘Barbearian’ Review – A Hack and Slash Delight\n\n\n\n$8.99\n\n\n\n$8.99\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n5 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n‘Zero Escape’ Review – A Nifty Retro-Themed Puzzler\n\n\n\n$0.99\n\n\n\n$0.99\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n4 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n‘KataKoto’ Review – Click-Clack Cube Confusion\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n3.5 stars\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nLatest Posts\n\n\n\nPing-Paint-Pong (by Crevasse)\n\n\n\ncrevasse\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nToday at 11:56 AM\n\n\n\nIdle, easy with rich gameplay.

Their last game,\n\n\n\nYear Walk\n\n\n\n, was a Swedish folklore-inspired horror adventure with an insane companion app that went well beyond explaining the characters and symbols used in the game. Device 6, their latest game, is a more focused title, but no less original. It’s also a fantastic reading and gaming experience.\n\n\n\nTo dive too deeply into the content of Device 6 would start to eat away at the game’s surprise and charm. So if you want a “clean read” of the game, go ahead and buy it now. It’s worth it. It’s awesome.\n\n\n\nStill here? I won’t spoil anything for you, but here are some broad strokes about what Device 6 is. Mostly what you do in this game is read. This novella-length tale tells the story of a woman who wakes up trapped in a room, and goes on from there, using a “House of Leaves”-style branching text that’s full of mysteries and curiosities. Often you’ll have to turn your iOS device left and right to follow the labyrinthine sentences along the page.\n\n\n\nThe story is also dotted with cryptic illustrations, videos, and audio, some of which are interactive. These act as puzzles that, once solved, let you progress further in the story. There’s little in the way of explanation for how to solve the puzzles, so you’ll have to pay attention as you read, and keep your eyes peeled for clues. I only got very stuck once, but most of the puzzles are tough enough to make you feel smart for solving them.\n\n\n\nTo explain more about Device 6 would do it a disservice. I enjoyed the story/game a lot, and can easily recommend it to anyone interested in diving into a moody mystery.\n\n\n\nMore stories on\n\n\n\nDevice 6\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOur Awesome Email Newsletter\n\n\n\nEnter your email to subscribe to our daily email on what's hot in mobile games.

A fun little diversion of a word game that is the devil child of crosswords and scrabble. For each level in the game the grid must be completed to win the level — this means that each letter at the top and side must be used. And not just the top or side, but each word must be made up of letters from the top and side to create a grid. It’s a pain, but in the right kind of way. Even the simplest of the levels can be a head scratcher until you get used to the game. Well worth the $3 as a diversion while we wait for Milkbag to finally release Snow Siege.\n\n\n\n$2.99\n\n\n\nMore on Sidewords »\n\n\n\nOut Now\n\n\n\n[Sponsored] Zap Zap Kindergarten Math will give your kids a pre-school math boost on mobile\n\n\n\nWe’d like to thank our sponsor for this week, Zap Zap Kindergarten Math.\n\n\n\nIt’s not always easy to tear your kids away from their tablets and make them do something edifying.

In this game, the player is dumped on shore with nothing. They must scavenge around for food, water, and weapons while avoiding attack. It’s the kind of game where the goal is to stay alive as long as possible. But that will never be very long. It’s oddly free and seems to only have an ad on the main screen — for now.\n\n\n\nFree\n\n\n\nMore on this game »\n\n\n\nOut Now\n\n\n\nPoint and click adventure The Little Acre charms\n\n\n\nPewter Games has brought their charming point and click adventure The Little Acre to iOS.

There’s a reason Leonardo Da Vinci is the only renaissance figure who routinely shows up in video games you know. With his remarkable inventiveness and genius for creative problem-solving, Da Vinci was a gamer through and through. He was just born 500 hundred years too soon. Thankfully, there are studios like Blue Brain Games to bring him to life in videogame form. The House of Da Vinci, which comes to us courtesy of a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign, is a puzzler that seeks to channel the artistry and innovation of its title character.\n\n\n\nYou play as one of Da Vinci’s more promising apprentices, and you have the challenging task of trying to work out where the hell he’s gone. Was he assassinated by the church? Who knows. Has he quietly gone into a retirement? Perhaps. Did he accidentally invent a shrink ray and shrink himself down to the size of an dustmite? Probably not. Da Vinci’s workshop looks beautiful, thanks to some impressive 3D graphics, and the in-game environment is crammed with all the elaborate machines and crazy inventions you’d expect to find in the workplace of a renaissance genius.\n\n\n\n(more…)\n\n\n\n$2.99\n\n\n\nMore on this game »\n\n\n\nOut Now\n\n\n\nPoly Bridge, the best bridge builder is out, but incomplete on mobile (so far)\n\n\n\nPoly Bridge is out now on iOS, and it’s good to have it! It’s a great game and many seem to agree that it’s the best bridge builder game available. But the iOS versions, so far, is missing the sandbox mode. I would hope that it’s coming soon in an update.

This week\'s games include a meta-narrative masterpiece, the Dark Knight and time-traveling bears.\n\n\n\nDevice 6\n\n\n\nReviewed on: iPhone 4S Platforms: iPad, iPhone Price: £2.49 / $3.99\n\n\n\nDevice 6 is the latest game from Year Walk developer Simogo, and just like their last effort, it is a showpiece for how to properly make a mobile game.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\n\nAt first glance, Device 6 is essentially a text adventure, as much of the game involves reading the story of Anna as she finds herself trapped on a mysterious island.\n\n\n\n©\n\n\n\nSimogo\n\n\n\n©\n\n\n\nSimogo\n\n\n\nHowever, the way text is laid out is unique and significant. Walking down a long hallway might appear as a long single line of text while turning a corner might have you literally rotate your iPhone and start scrolling in a different direction in order to keep reading.\n\n\n\nThere is more than just text though, as images will also be cut into the page, some interactive and some static, but all of them contributing to a greater puzzle.\n\n\n\nThe puzzles are very subtle but also immensely clever, asking you to pay very close attention for any clues in the story.\n\n\n\nIt is the type of game you need to play with a pad of paper nearby so that you can jot down notes, diagrams and numbers to remember for later use in the multi-part puzzles.\n\n\n\nYou will also want to play with the sound on, and possibly with headphones, in order to get the full effect of the jazzy soundtrack and occasional puzzle with sound cues.\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to say more, since so much of what makes Device 6 spectacular is in discovering it for yourself.\n\n\n\nSuffice it to say though, for puzzle fans Device 6 is hands-down the game that best takes advantage of the iPhone as a gaming platform.\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\n\n> Download \'Device 6\' from the App Store\n\n\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins\n\n\n\nReviewed on: iPhone 4S Platforms: iPad, iPhone Price: Free\n\n\n\nBatman: Arkham Origins comes from NetherRealm Studios, the same developer behind both the console and iOS port of Injustice: Gods Among Us .\n\n\n\nThe iOS Arkham game borrows a lot from the studio\'s last mobile fighter, using the same one-on-one fighting with taps and swipes to throw light and hard punches.\n\n\n\n©\n\n\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n\n\nBlocking can be performed by holding two fingers on the screen, though there has also thankfully been a new block button added since the two-finger method is a little inconsistent.\n\n\n\nUsing the same setup as the console game, Batman will take on thugs in four districts of Gotham by tapping on missions as they pop up on the map.\n\n\n\nBatman is also being hunted by assassins from his rogue\'s gallery like Deadshot and Copperhead, who will pop up occasionally in unskippable battles as well as boss encounters capping off each district.\n\n\n\nThere\'s a clear cycle to the game. Completing missions earns you cash to upgrade Batman\'s combos and abilities, which in turn lets you take on more challenging missions.\n\n\n\nAs a free-to-play game, there\'s a stamina bar limiting how many missions you can take on in one sitting, dragging out the game through artificial restrictions instead of actual challenges.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\n\nUltimately, Batman: Arkham Origins is a decent brawler, but is severely lacking in variety as you beat up the same handful of thugs over and over again.\n\n\n\nIf you\'re looking for a comic book fix, Injustice: Gods Among Us uses the same style of play with a much more robust game to back it up.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n> Download \'Batman: Arkham Origins\' from the App Store\n\n\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\n\nFist of Awesome\n\n\n\nReviewed on: iPhone 4S Platforms: iPad, iPhone, Android Price: £2.49 / $3.99\n\n\n\nFist of Awesome is an arcade-style brawler in the vein of classics like Double Dragon .\n\n\n\nYou play as Tim Burr, a lumberjack with a talking hand who must punch his way through history to stop time-traveling bears from destroying humanity.\n\n\n\n©\n\n\n\nI Fight Bears\n\n\n\nIt\'s all as silly as it sounds, with a joke snuck into pretty much every line of dialog and a new visual gag with each new enemy.\n\n\n\nThe brawler gameplay works surprisingly well on a touch screen, using your thumb on the left half of the screen to move while taps and swipes on the right side perform punches, kicks and jumps.\n\n\n\nWhile the combat works well enough, the limited controls mean that you\'ll mostly rely on the same three punch combo for the entire game.\n\n\n\nSince every new enemy is essentially a re-skinned version of an older enemy with a bigger health bar, all of the brawling can get rather tedious by the end.\n\n\n\nIt\'s the humor that will ultimately carry you through Fist of Awesome , whether it\'s the multitude of historical bear costumes or a cheeky reference to UK tax code.\n\n\n\nJust know that the humor is piggybacking on a brawler that can fluctuate between fun and frustrating the more you play.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n> Download \'Fist of Awesome\' from the App Store > Download \'Fist of Awesome\' from the Google Play Store\n\n\n\nWhat mobile releases have you been playing recently?

That’s what has happened to Anna, who is the protagonist in the new game DEVICE 6 . It comes from Simogo, the creative minds behind Year Walk , Bumpy Road , Beat Sneak Bandit , and Kosmo Spin . DEVICE 6 definitely aligns more with Year Walk, and Simogo is starting to build up a reputation for mysterious titles that really push the limits of the definition of “game”. It’s tough to review DEVICE 6 without spoiling any of the mystery it holds, but we will do our best. At the most basic level, it’s a text based adventure that is unlike anything else you have ever experienced on any other platform. Experience is a good word, because DEVICE 6 is more than just a game, more than just an interactive storybook, and it’s really a new interactive medium. Puzzles abound in what is in essence a mystery story supplanted with all kinds of challenges to work your way from chapter to chapter. Rather than a simple page by page layout, each chapter is one continuous flow with the text continuously unfolding in a unique manner. For instance, you may start scrolling the page vertically, but then the text and arrows direct you to rotate your device 90 degrees for a bit, and then you’ll end up flipping 180 degrees. The text almost follows the movement of the character whether they’re walking down corridors, turning at corners, or circling back the way they came. It’s an absolutely brilliant idea that grips you into the storyline, and makes you care about the text to an even greater degree. Throughout the text, there are images, but they’re more like moving windows that unveil extra bits as you slide the page in the given direction. There’s so much to explore in every part of a chapter that you’ll end up going over the same portions multiple times to get more of what it holds.\n\n\n\nDEVICE 6 is the type of game that requires a pen and paper, as you will need to continuously scribble down notes to figure out the puzzles at hand. You can fill up a half page easy per chapter, and you can’t help but appreciate the time that went into crafting such finely tuned puzzles. The main takeaway is that you have to expect the unexpected in every single portion of the game, and that will make you go slower, and more meticulously through the story. The clues are there staring you in the face, but you have to know where to look to uncover them. You will end up re-reading the text, and starring at the images time after time, and then there’s a whole other audio component to contend with. You will want to set aside time in a quiet place to decipher the clues within DEVICE 6, and playing with headphones can make your skin crawl at times in this creepy mystery. Every single part of the app is designed to put you in the main character’s shoes to see what she sees, hear what she hears, and think what she thinks. Speaking of design, the production values of DEVICE 6 are unmatched in the App Store with such a high degree of fit and finish applied to every pixel of text, and imagery. It’s amazing how much detail can come from a game that still fills a majority of the screen with blank canvas. At the end of each chapter, there’s a little twist that offers up a thought provoking question and answer segment that masquerades as though you’re at a testing facility when analyzing this story. The story itself is incredible in its own right, and the text in a plain word document would be compelling enough on its own. It’s taken to the next level with the layout, eerie imagery, and timely audio sequences. You end up hanging on every word, especially since you need to find the hidden clues to solve specific puzzles to complete a chapter.\n\n\n\nThis is the type of experience that you want to savor every moment of, because on one side you want to figure out the conclusion, but on the other you don’t want it to end. It’s truly remarkable in every regard, and Simgo has done an excellent job in building upon what they started with Year Walk, and the even more mysterious Companion app. There’s simply nothing like it in the App Store, or on any platform for that matter. Once you get started, it will encompass your thoughts whether it’s the thought provoking puzzles, or the mysterious storyline that very slowly unfolds into even more off shooting mysteries. Part of the enjoyment is just trying to figure out what exactly is going on to the main character. The only drawback is that the puzzles can be quite mind-bending, which can leave you completely stumped, and if that happens there’s no way forward. There’s no optional hint system, so you’re left on a sequence that you have no clue what to do with. That really comes with the territory though, and you need to understand what you’re getting yourself into. This game will challenge you, but it’s oh so rewarding when a chapter clicks into place, and that feeling is rarely duplicated.\n\n\n\nDEVICE 6 ( $3.99, Universal ) is an absolute must buy that is an experience not to be missed, as you will end up appreciating every minute with. It’s completely engrossing in every regard, and it’s just so finely made to truly put you in the shoes of the protagonist, and get your mind racing just like hers. It’s an all new art form in all honesty that is unlike anything else you have ever experienced, and it’s such a rewarding undertaking that you will remember long after it’s done. Give yourself this treat, you deserve it.\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\nLeave A Response\n\n\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\n\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\nWhat's

While the studio has always been a purveyor of a different kind of experience on iOS, this year their releases have been centered around story-telling and puzzle solving. It started with Year Walk and now continues with Device 6 . They’re creating unique and intelligent experiences that deserve to be seen and heard.\n\n\n\nNow, much like\n\n\n\nYear Walk\n\n\n\n, this is something that is best when not spoiled so I’m only going to touch on cursory details of the plot and scenario: this is a sort of interactive piece of fiction that players read through that frequently wraps around the screen, requiring players to rotate their device to keep up with where everything is going. The story is about a woman named Anna, who wakes up in mysterious circumstances. To advance the story, certain puzzles, whose hints are embedded in the narrative and visuals, must be solved. The challenge comes from solving the puzzles and putting together the hints – have some pen and paper or some kind of writing app on a computer or other device open to take down notes to solve everything and to advance the story.\n\n\n\nI suppose there’s an argument to be made for as to whether Device 6 is a “game” or not – all the interactive elements are there primarily to drive the story and to pace out the discoverability of it. But, the world is more effective because it’s not just a book. The interactivity, the fact that the player is directly interfacing with Device 6 , is a crucial part of the experience. While there’s no punishment for failure other than being stuck at that point in the story, that interactivity at the core qualifies it as a ‘game’ in my book. Though really, as a vehicle for an emotional experience does it really matter what we call it?\n\n\n\nSimogo’s style seems to be one of meta-fictional references and sometimes trying to make their point rather bluntly. The other edge of the sword is that it’s kind of nice to know that this is a game whose puzzles and messages are not hidden in obscurity.\n\n\n\nDevice 6\n\n\n\nis there to be discovered. And that’s the thing that’s so great about it: there’s little else like it. It’s a story, but one that takes advantage of sound and visuals, and being on a touchscreen device rather than just ink on paper.\n\n\n\nDevice 6 ’s emotional response may not be as affecting as Year Walk was for me, and the depth of replayability is certainly more obscured than Year Walk was, if it does exist (I haven’t quite figured it out yet!). But Device 6 was engrossing for the entire time that I played it, and give it my highest recommendation. Simogo’s doing something few others are doing, and it’s wonderful that someone is both providing great experiences and testing the limits of interactive media.\n\n\n\niPhone Screenshots\n\n\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\n\n\niPad Screenshots\n\n\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\n\n\nPosted in: Reviews , Games , iPhone Apps and Games , iPad Apps and Games , iPad Games\n\n\n\nTagged With: $3.99 , Simogo , Interactive Fiction , Device 6\n\n\n\nShare This:\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nReview disclosure: note that the product reviewed on this page may have been provided to us by the developer for the purposes of this review.

As you navigate your way through Year Walk developer Simogo\'s text-based adventure, you quickly come to realise that the words on screen are your eyes, your ears, your map, your compass, your salvation, and - potentially - your doom.\n\n\n\nYou assume the role of Anna, a woman who is trying to escape the confines of an unspecified island. Like an \'80s adventure book, her story unfolds via blocks of text punctuated by moments of interactivity. These moments usually you inputting numbers or characters into a keypad, activating recorded messages, or simply watching video screens.\n\n\n\nHowever, is not just the content of the text which brings DEVICE 6 \'s bizarre and claustrophobic world to life. As you read, the words onscreen begin to reshape themselves to reflect the locations the describe. When Anna walks down a corridor, the text converts from paragraph formatting into a single snaking sentence. As Anna comes to a corner, the sentence will veer off on a 90-degree angle, forcing you to rotate your iPhone to continue scrolling and reading.\n\n\n\nIt a simple but ingenious trick, one which constantly forces you to adjust your perspective. The sense of disorientation created by these shifts in perspective echoes Anna\'s own confusion, drawing you deeper into her strange and often disturbing journey. Sometimes, grey text will flank the main narrative, offering snippets internal monologue that hint at deeper mysteries.\n\n\n\nThe story is peppered with perverse imagery, strange riddles, and inferred violence. The puzzles are equally inventive and unusual, forcing you to examine every photo and analyse every sound for potential clues. It\'s a heady combination of theme, form, and function, all working together to impart a haunting tale of isolation and manipulation.\n\n\n\nDEVICE 6 not only explores the boundaries of narrative storytelling, it also demonstrates the creative potential of touchscreen gaming. Though its subject matter may be bleak, the game\'s ambition and intelligence make it a joyous and truly singular experience, one which adventure game fans won\'t want to miss.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n** Winner of Apple Design Award 2014 **\n\n\n\nA surreal thriller in which the written word is your map, as well as your narrator.\n\n\n\nDEVICE 6 plays with the conventions of games and literature, entwines story with geography and blends puzzle and novella, to draw players into an intriguing mystery of technology and neuroscience.\n\n\n\nAnna wakes up in a castle on a remote island, with little recollection of how she got there. All she remembers is an unusually unpleasant doll.\n\n\n\nWhy are there two identical castles on the island? Who is the mysterious man in the bowler hat? And above all, what is the purpose of the tests Anna is put through?\n\n\n\nRead, listen and peek into three-dimensional photographs to solve the bizarre mysteries of DEVICE 6.\n\n\n\n""DEVICE 6 is designed to linger in the mind long after the last code has been cracked and the last sentence read. Spy stories - even traditional ones - often haunt their readers\' dreams once they\'ve been completed. It\'s only appropriate, really. Is that a final full-stop or a microdot? Is this the end of the affair or an invitation to go deeper?""\n\n\n\nEurogamer - 9/10\n\n\n\n""In using its text both as narrative and as geography – and through its impressively restrained use of illustration and sound – it generates an almost unrivalled sense of place. It isn’t embarrassed to allow Device 6 to be a game when it needs to be, and yet it knows precisely when to let the story take over. The result is a sharp, striking mystery that is at once provocative, extraordinarily stylish and altogether essential""\n\n\n\nEDGE - 9/10\n\n\n\n""In turning a text adventure into a world map, Simogo has resurrected a long-dead genre with style and confidence. Great presentation and brilliant puzzles complete a stellar package""\n\n\n\nPocketgamer – 9/10\n\n\n\n""Ever exceeding expectations, the developer has followed up one of 2013′s highlights with another title that can be classed as such. With a compelling story that keeps you guessing, and a pin-point utilisation of the platform, Device 6 is an accomplishment in games design, mobile or otherwise""\n\n\n\nGod is a Geek - 9/10\n\n\n\n""DEVICE 6 not only explores the boundaries of narrative storytelling, it also demonstrates the creative potential of touchscreen gaming""\n\n\n\nAppspy – 5/5\n\n\n\n""Simogo’s doing something few others are doing, and it’s wonderful that someone is both providing great experiences and testing the limits of interactive media""\n\n\n\n148apps - 5/5\n\n\n\n""An ingenious slice of puzzling adventure that\'s as imaginative as it is stylish""\n\n\n\nModojo - 4.5/5\n\n\n\nWhat\'s New in Version 1.3\n\n\n\n- Added iPhone X support\n\n\n\n2 Comments\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n\n\n\nScreenshot 1 of 10\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nHey, do you want to say something?

For the past hour, I\'d been stuck on a particularly tricky puzzle that appears early on in Device 6, a strange and wonderful interactive novel from Simogo, the Swedish developer behind Year Walk. I\'ve been guiding my character back and forth through this small chunk of an island, paying attention to every detail in the engaging prose and imagery, trying to pluck the one kernel of information I need in order to solve a combination lock at the end of the area. Suddenly, like a bolt of lightning that immediately precedes most revelations, the solution hit me: I rummaged through my notes and realized that I had solved the puzzle about half an hour ago, but didn\'t even know it.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nMy journey of solving this puzzle taught me some important things. First and foremost, I was completely in love with the story and presentation of Device 6. You begin your adventure as Anna, an amnesiac who wakes up on an island brimming with a \'60s Bond-esque aesthetics, atmospheric jazz score, and a heaping dose of J.J. Abrams-style mysteries. Unraveling the truth behind Anna, the island, and the strange puzzles that populate it provides some of the most mentally rewarding moments of any game I\'ve played this year.\n\n\n\nAll of this unfolds in text, still images, and occasional videos, but it’s done in a creative way that’s representative of the path Anna takes as she navigates the physical space of the island. Swiping across the story is analogous with guiding Anna across the mysterious expanse. When text scrolls to the right, Anna is heading east; when the words are presented in the form of downward steps, she\'s descending a staircase. When Anna encounters a mirror, the text is displayed backwards, forcing you to hold your iPhone or iPad up to an actual mirror. It’s a technique akin to the way Mark Z. Danielewski used typography to create a sense of unease in his novel House of Leaves , and it creates a sense of place and movement unlike any other text adventure I’ve ever played.\n\n\n\nThe prose itself is extremely well written, effortlessly hopping between humor and horror, all the while maintaining its central air of mystery. The specific images and videos that accompany the text add to the narrative while simultaneously serving as a source of clues needed to solve Device 6\'s various puzzles, which are devilishly tough, but always fair. Each of the six chapters reach a point where Anna hits some sort of obstacle, and it then becomes up to us to retrace our steps and take careful note of everything that we\'ve read, seen, and heard in order to pass. For instance, the end of one chapter had me jotting down notes as I listened to a series of cryptic espionage messages looping from the mouths of three stuffed bears, analyzing what each said in order to discover which one was telling the truth, and ultimately using that information to solve a combination lock which peeled back yet another layer of the fantastic story. The rewarding information became even more powerful because of what I had accomplished to earn it.\n\n\n\nNo matter how long a specific challenge may have taken me to solve, I never felt like I was being treated unfairly. Device 6 lays down its internal logic and core set of rules right from the starts, and it\'s then up to us to pay attention to its context clues, which are hidden (sometimes in plain sight) within text, imagery, sounds, and geography. Few puzzle games have ever married these types of clues in such a fantastic union. But if you do happen to get stuck, check out our incredible Wiki for tips on how to solve a particular predicament.\n\n\n\nMy playthrough ran over the course of six nights, tackling a single chapter in each session. These ranged from a breezy 15-minute run where a puzzle clicked immediately, to the nearly two-hour odyssey of scribbled notes, crudely drawn maps, and an ultimate sense of great satisfaction. Throughout my five hours or so with Device 6, I had to uncover lock combinations, decode Cold War-era messages, and pay attention to each and every adjective in the story in order to make my way through its devilishly challenging puzzles. Perhaps best of all, the end of Device 6\'s journey culminates with one of the most satisfying payoffs I\'ve ever experienced in a video game. Seriously, the final chapter really ties the room together.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nDevice 6 is fantastic regardless of which iOS device you decide to play it on, despite the experiences being slightly different. An iPhone\'s smaller size makes the necessity of constantly twisting and turning your physical device a breeze, where the larger real estate of an iPad makes the gorgeous, Wes Anderson-style typography pop even more. And though the solutions to the puzzles remain static on a second playthrough and lose those fantastic ""aha!"" moments, I gladly took another trip through Device 6 for the same reason I annually replay Portal. Going back through those worlds allow me to gain newfound insight into the story and characters in the same way that rereading a favorite book sheds a new light on it.\n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\nNot since Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP has an iOS game had me so completely engrossed. Device 6 delivers a wholly unique puzzle experience brimming with amazing ideas and impeccable style. The fantastic, multilayered story unfolds expertly, and culminates with one of the best final acts in recent memory. Device 6 is simply one of the smartest and most rewarding games I\'ve played in years.\n\n\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\nDevice 6\n\n\n\nReleased Oct. 17th, 2013\n\n\n\niPhone\n\n\n\nAmazing\n\n\n\nDevice 6 deftly marries puzzles and story to create one of the smartest, most engrossing games of 2013.\n\n\n\n27 Nov 2013\n\n\n\nWonderfully unique\n\n\n\nFantastic puzzles\n\n\n\nIntriguing story\n\n\n\nBeautiful imagery\n\n\n\nRewarding payoff\n\n\n\n9.5\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nRead our review standards\n\n\n\nBuying Guide\n\n\n\nPowered by IGN Deals\n\n\n\nWiki Guide\n\n\n\nDevice 6 Walkthrough\n\n\n\nChapter 1 - Awakening, Chapter 2 - The Story of the Three Bears, Chapter 3 - Tiptoe Through the Tulips, Chapter 4 - An Inverted Funeral, Chapter 5 - The Show, Chapter 6 - Technical Perfection,\n\n\n\nSurveys\n\n\n\nSurvey 1, Survey 2, Survey 3, Survey 4, Survey 5,\n\n\n\n9 Pages\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\nUpdate: Nintendo Switch Getting 6.0.0 Update Next Week\n\n\n\nAHS: Apocalypse Kicked Things Off with...The End\n\n\n\nWhy It\'s Insane That Warner Bros.

The Malmö-based team has built a reputation on audio-visual synchronicity, whether it’s the colourful rhythm-action of Beat Sneak Bandit or the harrowing, cold atmosphere of Year Walk .\n\n\n\nTheir latest game, Device 6, is another fabulous invention. It’s a combination of visual novel and room-escape puzzling, masterfully blending written prose, audio cues, economical imagery and even the physical properties of the hardware you are holding.\n\n\n\nThe game tells the story of Anna, a young woman who wakes to find herself trapped in a sparse tower on a mysterious, seemingly deserted island with no recollection of how she got there. A lighthouse blinks in the distance, and if mystery fiction set on uncharted lands tell us anything it’s this: always head towards the lighthouse.\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nThe Stanley Parable review\n\n\n\n12 Nov 2013\n\n\n\nFootball Manager 2014 review\n\n\n\n29 Oct 2013\n\n\n\nWii Party U Review\n\n\n\n26 Oct 2013\n\n\n\nGTA 5 Strangers & Freaks - The Reality Check\n\n\n\n21 Oct 2013\n\n\n\nThe Wolf Among Us, Episode 1: Faith review\n\n\n\n17 Oct 2013\n\n\n\nSkylanders Swap Force review\n\n\n\n14 Oct 2013\n\n\n\nAnna’s story unfolds in text, with the sentences on your screen doubling as the landscape she is travelling. As the paragraph reaches a thin corridor, a sentence will detach itself and stretch across the screen your finger tracing its path, a spiral staircase twists upwards in a whirlwind of letters, turn left and the text turns left in step, you rotating the device to follow.\n\n\n\nDevice 6 conjures a remarkable sense of place and isolation with its words alone, branching paths simply asking you to read in a certain direction; with you then able to backtrack by retracing the words and heading off another way. As the island reveals its secrets, there’s a sense of 1960s espionage, Anna stumbling across an all too convenient litany of peculiar machinery and doors barred by electronic locks.\n\n\n\nPictures and sound are interspersed into the prose; blinking screens, discarded notes and hissing ‘60s tape recorders leaving messages that give clues to your progression. Device 6 is segmented into 6 chapters, each of which revolves around a layered brainteaser that unlocks the door at which the chapter’s final full stop rests.\n\n\n\nUsually when reviewing a game my notes will be random scribbled thoughts, but for Device 6 it was hastily scrawled clues picked up along the way. To detail any of the puzzles would spoil Device 6’s constant sense of playfulness and imagination, but they constantly surprise, gleefully swapping between traditional conundrums and more inventive uses of your iPhone’s physical form. It is rare that iOS games make the machine such an integral part of their gameplay, but Simogo do here in wonderful style, recalling the work of the sadly defunct Japanese studio CiNG on Another Code and Hotel Dusk.\n\n\n\nDevice 6 is a short game, polished off in a couple of hours, but its effects will linger. Its narrative is sharp and engrossing and its style, while drawing on influences as disparate as Lost and Kafka, is quite unlike anything else.\n\n\n\nVideo Game Reviews\n\n\n\nTechnology »\n\n\n\nTom Hoggins »\n\n\n\nVideo Games »\n\n\n\nTechnology Reviews »\n\n\n\nThe best tablets\n\n\n\nIn Video Game Reviews\n\n\n\nMortal Kombat X review\n\n\n\nTitan Souls review\n\n\n\nHotline Miami 2: Wrong Number review\n\n\n\nOri and the Blind Forest review\n\n\n\nBloodborne review\n\n\n\nRead more from Telegraph Technology\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMore from the web\n\n\n\nLoading\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMore from the web\n\n\n\nLoading\n\n\n\nTechnology choice\n\n\n\niPhone 6s and 6s Plus rumours: all you need to know\n\n\n\nSeven tips to secure your iPhone from hackers\n\n\n\nHow hackers took over my computer\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nThe latest news, opinion and analysis\n\n\n\nView\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nCatch up on all the latest football news and results\n\n\n\nView\n\n\n\nFilm\n\n\n\nAll the latest film trailers, reviews and features\n\n\n\nView\n\n\n\nCompetitions\n\n\n\nEnter one of our exciting new competitions\n\n\n\nView\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n\nTechnology News\n\n\n\nTechnology Reviews\n\n\n\nTechnology Advice\n\n\n\nTechnology Video\n\n\n\nInternet Security\n\n\n\nBroadband\n\n\n\nMobile Phones\n\n\n\nSamsung\n\n\n\nNokia\n\n\n\nHTC\n\n\n\nMobile Reviews\n\n\n\nApp Reviews\n\n\n\nTelegraph for iPad\n\n\n\nCompanies\n\n\n\nApple\n\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nAmazon\n\n\n\nVideo Games\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nTrailers\n\n\n\nPreviews\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nPlayStation\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Cookies\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\n\nFantasy Football\n\n\n\nTickets\n\n\n\nAnnouncements\n\n\n\nReader Prints\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\nApps\n\n\n\nEpaper\n\n\n\nExpat\n\n\n\nPromotions\n\n\n\nSubscriber\n\n\n\nSyndication\n\n\n\n© Copyright of Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018\n\n\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\n\nToday\'s News\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nStyle Book\n\n\n\nWeather Forecast', 'html PUBLIC""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN""""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""\n\n\n\nMac|Life\n\n\n\nWelcome to Mac|Life\n\n\n\nThe world\'s leading Apple magazine\n\n\n\nMac|Life is your trusty sidekick for all things Apple, from Mac to iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.

It\'s the epitome of wasted potential and had me wondering aloud such other popular axioms as, ""Man, this game is easy! Is that really the only thing my guy can do?"" and ""What\'s up with this dummy AI?""\n\n\n\nDespite being developed by Beenox , X-Men is absolutely identical to the console versions of the game developed by Z-Axis (a very talented crew that brought us the excellent extreme classics, Aggressive Inline and Thrasher: Skate and Destroy). But just like those versions, X-Men lacks the polish and depth that Z-Axis\' previous software has always had and isn\'t any more forgivable as a port. At its best, this film prequel is a limited and straightforward beat \'em up that benefits from a touch of sky surfing and a smaller dose of smoke and mirrors. It\'s a hard pill to swallow to say the least, and especially so when coming off the memories of the addictive X-Men Legends franchise and dozens of other similar action games.\n\n\n\nTo its credit, X-Men: The Official Game does try to mix it up. The three playable characters are certainly different in how they operate and none of the three feel like carbon copies of each other. Wolverine, for example, is your basic scrapper complete with quick attacks, heavy blows, and a fury mode, while the teenaged Iceman is a blown-up surfer -- a guy that soars through the air on a pathway of ice who can also fire various kinds of frozen projectiles at enemies. The most entertaining character to use, however, is ""the Amazing Nightcrawler"". A highly-acrobatic weirdo that can ""Bamph"" from one point to another (aka teleport), the little blue devil offers a nice mix of quick fisticuffs, limited platforming, and speedy twitch challenges.\n\n\n\nBut the problem with these guys isn\'t their diversity from one another; it\'s their diversity of options within their own arsenal. The hairy badass Logan, for instance, never really offers anything beyond a few easily repeatable combos and he has actually taken a step backward from the abilities in 2003\'s Wolverine\'s Revenge. This kind of simplistic combat applies to Iceman as well. The young mister Drake can only shoot frozen beams or utilize a missile-like Hailstorm attack while occasionally needing to summon an ice shield for protection. That\'s pretty much all these guys do -- and it gets repetitive quickly.\n\n\n\nMaking things even worse is the fact that a broader move set isn\'t even needed. Enemy AI is downright brainless and doesn\'t offer much beyond a tendency to defend everything with little response on the hard difficulty setting. When opponents do attack, though, they usually follow the same one to three-hit combo that all their palette-swapped buddies do -- making them easy targets for whatever punishment your mutant team wants to dish out. Of course, if you want to get technical, the stiff mouse and keyboard gameplay does make the game harder... if that counts (mortal: use the intended gamepad).\n\n\n\nIt isn\'t all bad, though, as there are a couple of cool moments that really make playing through X-Men more tolerable than the battle engine would lead you to believe. Nightcrawler in particular should have had a title of his own, as his ability to maneuver via teleportation to inaccessible areas makes the game\'s otherwise boring and unimaginative level design interesting. The fact that Crawler can incorporate his teleports into combat as well makes his hand-to-hand confrontations the most fun too, and the fact that we learn his reason for not appearing in X3 is a nice, if not short, little surprise (the game is set between the last movie and the upcoming sequel due out next week, after all).\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNext »\n\n\n\nWiki Guide 14 Pages\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\nSpider-Man: A History of Every Costume in the PS4 Game\n\n\n\nEvery TV Show Canceled So Far This Year\n\n\n\nNHL 19 Review\n\n\n\nPUBG for Xbox One Review\n\n\n\nGwyneth Paltrow Posts Behind-the-Scenes Photos of Avengers 4\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider Review\n\n\n\nWho Is the Marvel Hero Teased in Iron Fist: Season 2?\n\n\n\nA Simple Favor Review\n\n\n\n© 1996-2018 Ziff Davis, LLC\n\n\n\nJoin the IGN Newsletter\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nAdChoices\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY .\n\n\n\n×', 'doctype html\n\n\n\nX-Men: The Official Game Review - GameSpot\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nSwitch\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nVita\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nGametech\n\n\n\nDeals\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nAll Videos\n\n\n\nTrailers\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nGravehoppers\n\n\n\nNostalgia Trip\n\n\n\nPotato Mode\n\n\n\nVersus\n\n\n\nNew Releases\n\n\n\nGameSpot Daily\n\n\n\nGameSpot Live\n\n\n\nSteam Punks\n\n\n\nReboot\n\n\n\nForums\n\n\n\nGames Discussion\n\n\n\nPC/Mac/Linux Society\n\n\n\nPlayStation Nation\n\n\n\nXbox Association\n\n\n\nNintendo Fan Club\n\n\n\nSystem Wars\n\n\n\nOff-Topic Discussion\n\n\n\nGameSpot Giveaways\n\n\n\nBug Reporting & Feedback\n\n\n\nSee all Forums\n\n\n\nSign In/Sign Up\n\n\n\nSign in / Join\n\n\n\nGame Info\n\n\n\nX-Men: The Official Game\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nNews & Features\n\n\n\nImages\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nCheats & Guides\n\n\n\nForum\n\n\n\nGameSpot\n\n\n\nX-Men: The Official Game\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nX-Men: The Official Game Review\n\n\n\nX-Men: The Official Game is officially a lame action-game cash-in on the upcoming movie.\n\n\n\nby Alex Navarro on May 18, 2006 18:26 PM\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nThe lousy movie-licensed game genre claims another victim in X-Men: The Official Game. Based loosely in-between the stories of the second and third films in the X-Men franchise, X-Men is a completely unremarkable beat-\'em-up (with a few boilerplate shooter elements tossed into the mix) that feels just haphazard enough to likely have been rushed through development to get it onto store shelves ahead of the film. It\'s not that it\'s entirely broken, mind you, but X-Men\'s missions are entirely generic and devoid of captivating content, and there are enough annoying little glitches and other obnoxious things prevalent throughout to give the game that thrown-together feel.\n\n\n\nThe X-Men are back! Well...a select few of them, anyway.\n\n\n\nX-Men seems to follow the basic plot concepts of the X-Men movies, but it centers its focus around three of the heroes: Wolverine, Nightcrawler, and Iceman. Whether this was a deliberate choice, or a direct response to which of the film\'s actors Activision could actually get to reprise their roles for the game (Hugh Jackman, Alan Cumming, and Shawn Ashmore are indeed in the game), we\'ll likely never know, but Nightcrawler\'s inclusion is specifcally to explain why he\'s not in the new movie. For what it\'s worth, Jackman, Cumming, and Ashmore all do serviceable jobs voicing the characters, as does Patrick Stewart, who returns to voice act Professor X. Unfortunately, the remaining cast is mostly made up of soundalikes, and none of them are particularly good.\n\n\n\nBy centering on these three characters and setting up the mission structure as the game does, you\'re left with a fairly disjointed sense of where the story is going. For instance, early on in the game, all three characters go through quick training sequences to get you familiar with how they work. The next mission is a return to Alkali Lake (the site of Jean Grey\'s tragic demise at the end of the second film) to recapture parts of the Cerebro machine taken by General Stryker. You start off as Nightcrawler, and are given the option later on to play either as Wolverine or Nightcrawler for another section. Once you\'ve made your pick, you\'re stuck with that character for the duration of his missions during this chapter (which can go up to around three or four in a row, at times). Only after you\'ve completed it can you switch over to the other available character. Not to mention that Iceman just disappears during this whole section and we don\'t join up with him until significantly later, in a completely new scenario that\'s given next to no plot exposition. It\'s not that a game of this type has to be some kind of brilliant work of fiction to succeed, but X-Men tells its story in such a perplexing and disconcerting way that it\'s difficult to care much about what\'s going on.\n\n\n\nEach of the three playable characters fights a little differently from the other. Wolverine obviously has his Adamantium claws, as well as a rage ability that gives him some particularly brutal moves; Nightcrawler can teleport to any area within his visual range, as well as use his teleporting abilities in combat to pull off more acrobatic moves and transport himself to a ""shadow realm"" to regenerate his health (an ability we\'re not sure he ever had before this game); and finally, Iceman perpetually rides on an icy surfboard, flying through the air while shooting his ice beam and ice projectiles, and inexplicably regenerating his health (an ability we\'re positive he didn\'t have before this game). The Iceman missions are almost more like rail shooters, since you\'re near-constantly in motion, floating about various areas and sometimes navigating perilous traps and pitfalls--and for that matter, the Iceman missions are probably the most interesting part of the game, if only in comparison to the utterly dull Nightcrawler and Wolverine segments.\n\n\n\nWhen you\'re playing as Wolverine or Nightcrawler, you\'re beating up a lot of enemies in relatively closed-off environments. Sometimes you need to find a control panel to open a door, and there are some platforming elements with the Nightcrawler sections (which can usually be circumvented altogether using his teleport ability), but for the most part you\'re just constantly fighting enemies with guns, electric sticks, electric spears, bazookas, or the occasional mutant power. Plenty of beat-\'em-up games have managed to suffice with a similar formula, but X-Men\'s combat is just boring. There\'s next to no combo variety to speak of, and it\'s awfully easy to just use Wolverine\'s power attacks or Nightcrawler\'s teleport attacks over and over again to break past an enemy\'s block to simply roll right over them over and over again. It\'s not that the fights are easy, exactly. Sometimes they can actually be a bit frustrating, especially when you\'re playing as Wolverine and getting pelted with bullets, and the only thing you can really do is run right at the guys with the guns. But frustration aside, there\'s nothing interesting about the fight sequences to make you want to keep playing. It\'s just button-mashing of the most banal variety.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of moments in the game that make you wonder just how much time this game really spent in development. There are no major show-stopping bugs, but rather a lot of little glitches that just keep popping up over and over again. Enemies will sometimes teleport from one side of a level to another instantaneously for no discernible reason; sometimes you can knock enemies into walls or doorways from which they cannot escape; scripted appearances of characters will sometimes get stuck and remain there even when they\'re clearly supposed to disappear moments later--there are a lot of little things like this. Boss fights also seem very poorly cobbled together. Most boss fights in the game simply revolve around you and the boss character running around an enclosed area, hitting each other for a bit, then running off, hitting each other again, and then running off, and so on. The bosses just aren\'t very smart, since you can basically pelt them with attacks, run to the far side of the environment to recharge a bit, and go back without them ever really running after you, or at least not very quickly.\n\n\n\nX-Men manages to deliver a pretty good visual experience, although there\'s nothing too special about it. The basic character models and animations are nicely detailed, as are a few of the environments. There are a couple of cool levels in particular, such as the power-plant-at-sundown scenario Iceman takes on at one point, as well as the sequence inside the Dark Cerebro machine from the 2nd movie. There\'s also a fair share of rather mundane looking areas in the game, but generally speaking, it\'s a pleasant enough game to look at. The most obnoxious visual aspect of X-Men, however, is its cutscenes, or practical lack thereof. All the game\'s story sequences are presented with still-frame shots of comic-book versions of the movie characters. You\'ll see these static characters awkwardly move across the screen to do various actions, and speak to one another with no mouth movement whatsoever. It doesn\'t even look so much like a comic book as it does the kind of purposely bad animation you\'d find on something like Sealab 2021 , but without the purpose. Every once in a while the game does go whole hog into the comic book style of transition, but it skips by each panel so fast that you can\'t read a single line of what\'s being said. As if the story weren\'t confusing enough already...\n\n\n\nX-Men beat-\'em-ups can be great--just look at the old X-Men Arcade Game. If the developers had played that a few more times, maybe they\'d have come up with something better than this trite junk.\n\n\n\nThere are five home system versions of X-Men currently available, with iterations on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, PC, and Xbox 360. The first four versions all look comparable to one another, with the Xbox version perhaps looking the best of the bunch. All four really do look practically the same, but the PC, GC and PS2 versions suffer from an erratic frame rate. The Xbox 360 version is actually also comparable to the other four versions--perhaps a little too comparable. To say that on a standard-definition TV, the 360 version looks pretty close to the Xbox version would be an understatement. They\'re practically identical, with only a slightly more noticeable bit of color depth apparent on the 360 version. Upping to HD resolution does improve matters, especially in terms of environmental detail, but it\'s not such a huge difference as to warrant the $60 price tag (as opposed to $40 for the other console versions, and $30 for the PC version). Suffice it to say, the 360 version is pretty much a rip-off.\n\n\n\nX-Men: The Official Game is ultimately an easily dismissible movie game to toss on the smoldering pile of other cash-in movie games released over the years. Its existence is solely based on the need to have an X-Men game to coincide with the hype surrounding the film, and it brings no interesting gameplay, story, visual, or feature components to the table to make it worth your time. It\'s all the more disappointing, considering that as of late, Activision has done well with the X-Men license with games like the X-Men Legends series. You\'d have to go all the way back to 2002 for something like X-Men: Next Dimension to find a comparably lame use of the X-Men license to X-Men: The Official Game, and trust us when we say that this is not something you ever want to go back to.\n\n\n\nUpvote\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nView Comments (0)\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nCall Of Duty: Black Ops 4 Blackout Beta Is Live On Xbox One And PC\n\n\n\nWolfenstein 3 Confirmed By Bethesda\n\n\n\nAll The Nintendo Direct News\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros.

If you are a gamer who wants a wireless connection that does not lag, and that lasts for up to 10 hours between charges this is for you. It has state-of-the-art audio with Dolby 7.1 Headphone Surround Sound, and it is made to be lag free with 2.4 Ghz of power. While this all sounds great, and the manufacturer has a good track record of making quality electronic products, the reviews always tell the story of whether or not this product is a winner with gamers.\n\n\n\nA Word to the Wise for Those Who Wear Glasses\n\n\n\nSeveral reviews have lamented that if you have to wear glasses to be able to play your games, this headset is probably not for you. The earpads, which are made of a faux leather-like material, will make a squeaking noise as they rub against the frame of your glasses. While other Logitech models have cloth earpads that can be replaced, this unit does not.\n\n\n\nOther gamers were very happy with the units – for about a year. After that the headset would slowly start cutting out, until it got to the point of not charging at all.\n\n\n\nOther Reviews From Those Who Loved the Headset\n\n\n\nOther people who have used this brand of headset for a few years, are very happy with it. Almost everyone who has used this headset is amazed at the quality of the audio, with all spectrums, from lows to highs reproduced flawlessly and clearly.\n\n\n\nThere also seems to be a good deal of disagreement over the durability of this headset. Some people reported using them for years with absolutely no problem. Some people reported having to use duct tape to keep them together after as little as two weeks of use. Taking into account these wildly varying reviews, one can only surmise that those who had the most serious problems put the headset through much more use than those who had no problems. But once again, that is only speculation.\n\n\n\nOther Reviews and Observations\n\n\n\nMany people bought this headset for the express purpose of using it on Skype calls. Once again, while many people had nothing but good experiences with this headset, others endured the annoyance of being cut off for up to 8 seconds during a call. Other reviewers noted that before it disconnected, there was an annoying crackling sound that lasted for awhile.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\n\nWith so many conflicting reviews, it is hard to make a definitive call on this headset. Even those who gave the headset a positive review had some problems with connectivity and getting the headset sync’d with the rest of their equipment. Still, if you look at other reviews, this is still one of the best rated wireless headsets on the market.\n\n\n\nSo, if you simply must have a wireless unit, this is probably your best bet. If you have to have something that is more reliable, you may want to consider a wired unit.\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\nLogitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound\n\n\n\nAdvance Wars Guide\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n...

They are known for Year Walk, Beat Sneak Bandit, Kosmo Spin and Bumpy Road. Each of these titles were known for being different in terms of their mechanics, gameplay and style, repeatedly proving that the duo from Sweden should be synonymous with art and quality when it comes to the iOS format. Like its predecessors, Device 6 evokes a Clue-inspired sense of analysis and a novella approach to story in order to proceed throughout your adventure. Put on your thinking cap, because this Device 6 brings about the sleuth in us all.\n\n\n\nDevice 6 immediately sets itself apart from nearly every single puzzle game I have ever played on the iOS format. Heck, there isn\'t even a console or PC title I can think of that resembles Device 6. Here\'s a rough description: take The 7th Guest (remember that?), throw in Sherlock Holmes, an inspiring narrative, Cast Away, Nancy Drew grown up and some Alfred Hitchcock to boot. Let it be known that Device 6 is NOT for everyone, especially those who easily give up at puzzles. Because Device 6 shows a mastery of not only puzzle game mechanics themselves, but spy/detective narratives where puzzles are again at the forefront. The culminating effect was that my mind got attacked from both sides, from reading the story itself and searching back and forth throughout the text and pictures in order to find clues so I can solve the current puzzle at hand. But what Simogo ingeniously does, is that they base the difficulty of the sequential levels in accordance to how fast you solved the previous level and your responses to a short survey that they give at the end of each stage. The resulting effect is that I was constantly hit sideways; just when I thought I was easily able to figure a puzzle out, boom, Device 6 drops a small detail that throws off my train of thought and forces me to re-evaluate the problem.\n\n\n\nWhile I have encountered my fair share of puzzle titles across the board, I have never found one as engaging, beautiful, shocking, and outright thought-provoking as Device 6. Without a doubt, the Swedish team that scripted this story, developed these puzzles and created their execution are prodigies in terms of game design. In terms of its actual story, Device 6 acts as a piece of meta-fiction. It makes you, the player/reader, explore the text as deep as you would like. But you are only rewarded with progression if your abilities of observation, analysis and memory (and mathematics occasionally) are sound.\n\n\n\nDevice 6 starts off like a book. Anna, the protagonist, wakes up in a strange mansion and has a case of amnesia. None of that is relevant, because she is locked away in this mansion and it is up to you to solve the riddles and puzzles Anna encounters throughout her endeavors. But what is most impressive, is how beautifully Device 6 presents this to you.\n\n\n\nAt first, Device 6 reads like an e-book, as if you were navigating one giant PDF file with your touchscreen. But what starts to happen is that you encounter 3D pictures scattered throughout the text, whose backgrounds and images scroll as you continue through the text, providing a large sense of depth as to what you are looking at. Device 6 breaks the fourth wall in order to put you, the player, in Anna\'s shoes. As Anna starts descending down a ladder, the text breaks and slows down to reflect her descent, while placing audio cues perfectly reflecting this action as well. Another scene similar to this is when you are scrolling through the text (with one sentence showing up along the equator of the screen), and Anna enters a dark room. As you scroll, a wall of black cuts off the sentence, and you are surprised with a light clicking on and a full page of text appearing on the screen out of nowhere.\n\n\n\nEven more ingenious is Device 6\'s delivery of its puzzle system. Here is the shortest puzzle I can describe throughout my ventures with Anna -- the first one ( spoilers of the first puzzle incoming ). Anna wakes up, finds a painting of an orangutan with a number painted on its corner, presumably the year this story takes place. As you progress from room to room, Anna finds that she is alone in this strange manor. She passes by a machine with a left and right button on top of it, which you see in a picture in the middle of the text and can actually push its buttons and hear them beep in response. Since you do not know how this mechanism is meant to function, you must simply continue on. Afterwards you pass by a warped scene containing numerous framed pictures on the wall, with each frame containing a single word. You also pass by a machine you can punch four digits into. Punching in the number from the monkey picture does nothing.\n\n\n\nAfterwards, Anna encounters a staircase, and the text splits into two directions, depending on whether or not you go downstairs. Let\'s say that you followed the text into the other upstairs rooms. You eventually hear a voice recording repeat itself from a speaker saying that the passcode is a combination of the number found between orange and yellow (the orangutan\'s colors), the number found between ""hope"" and ""lies"", and the channel the speaker is speaking from. Go a little bit further, and you find a surveillance cam with one of the camera channels focused on a tape recorder. If you go back near the beginning, you will find that hope and lies are two of the framed words in the warped scene. If you pan back and forth, you can eventually find a framed number. Add the orangutan number, the framed number and the tape recorder channel together, and you finally get the passcode. But the passcode isn\'t even the solution to the level, there is still the left and right buttoned machine to worry about..\n\n\n\nLet it be known, the only reason why Device 6 did not get a perfect score is because I know that it\'s not for everyone. Just when I thought I was getting used to the puzzles in Device 6, I would always encounter some form of fright or immense suspense brought on by Anna\'s circumstance. This kept me thoroughly engaged and inspired me to find out how she got there, and why was this happening to her. By this point in time, I still have trouble trying to decide whether or not Device 6 was a text-based game or a story with video game elements added in, but neither of those choices adequately describe it. In hindsight, I realize now that Device 6 can be easily categorized with one word: art. With such idiosyncrasies, you might ask yourself should you buy it? Well, that\'s a puzzle only you can solve. But if you think you have a decent amount of problem solving skills, I will simply leave you all with a hint -- yes!\n\n\n\nApp Store Link: Device 6 for iPhone & iPad | By Simogo | Price: $3.99 | Version: 1.0 | 137 MB | Rating: 12+\n\n\n\nFiled Under :\n\n\n\n9.0 out of 10 Review\n\n\n\n, Device 6\n\n\n\n, iOS Game Reviews\n\n\n\n, Simogo\n\n\n\nCategories :\n\n\n\niOS\n\n\n\n, iPad\n\n\n\n, iPhone\n\n\n\n, Puzzle Games\n\n\n\n, Reviews\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nLeave A Comment\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\n\n\nMost Modern Games Could Benefit From Special Photo Modes\n\n\n\nRecommend for You\n\n\n\nGet our Newsletter\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\nScreenCrush Network\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n2018 Arcade Sushi is part of the ScreenCrush Network , Townsquare Media , Inc.

Device 6 tells the story of Anna, a girl who awakens to find herself adrift in a tower set on on a spar of rock. As she starts to explore her surroundings, the sentences that construct her narrative begin to stretch out across the iPhone screen and form corridors, rooms, and battlements. It\'s a landscape you travel by reading. Turn left, and the text you\'re following turns left too, while paragraphs describing elevator journeys rise or descend with the thrum of a shuddering counterweight. The plot steadily unfurls into a map that you trace with swipes of your finger, leading you past mysteries stated and unstated, through puzzles both visible and hidden.\n\n\n\nAs with this February\'s Year Walk , Simogo displays a peculiar knack for conjuring isolation and recently vacated spaces, although the earlier game\'s church gates and tree stumps are replaced here with Bakelite telephones and hissing reel-to-reels, while fairytale illustration is traded for a blend of infographics and gorgeous old Penguin Books cover art. There\'s a touch of Cing\'s back catalogue to Device 6, and the whole production\'s been cold-filtered through 60s espionage TV, too. As Anna\'s journey drifts over territory initially staked out by Patricks McGoohan and Macnee, as codes are broken and dormant machinery roused, Simogo\'s game becomes the closest thing you\'ll probably ever get to playing a numbers station.\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel\n\n\n\nThe developer\'s clearly moved on since Year Walk, although the games definitely feel like fellow travellers. This time the narrative\'s even quicker to fold back on itself, eventually entangling audience and creator and even the hardware the whole thing\'s playing on. The medium is a message here, although you\'ll need to replay the game several times, possibly with a pad and paper, to get that message down in full.\n\n\n\nDevice 6 is quicker to organise itself, too: this is a tale told in six devices, six chapters, and six room escape mysteries. Each chapter\'s written with a surprisingly warm kind of precision and hinges on a stand-out brainteaser, one that often revolves around parallax-scrolling images set into the text itself. This is a short game, but the range of its imagination can be startling, and challenges shift from classic christmas cracker conundrums to ingenious uses of sound, vision, lateral thinking and even handset manipulation. What unites everything is the sheer playfulness: if you\'re stuck, you can just start tinkering with things, prodding buttons, drawing connections between disparate elements of a given chapter and then scrubbing them out in favour of a new approach.\n\n\n\nPrice and availability\n\n\n\nOut today for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch: £2.49\n\n\n\nThe dependable structure - the back and forth between travel and challenge as you burrow your way deeper into the narrative - provides some necessary orientation in such a strange and disarming game. It also allows Simogo to place its biggest mysteries outside of the moment-to-moment puzzling itself. Shifting from smirking puns at the creakiness of modern progression systems to a finale that\'s actually quietly devastating, Device 6 is designed to linger in the mind long after the last code has been cracked and the last sentence read. Spy stories - even traditional ones - often haunt their readers\' dreams once they\'ve been completed. It\'s only appropriate, really. Is that a final full-stop or a microdot? Is this the end of the affair or an invitation to go deeper?\n\n\n\n9 /10\n\n\n\nRead the Eurogamer.net reviews policy\n\n\n\nSometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Ricochet! Review\n\n\n\n0 comments\n\n\n\nDevice 6 Review\n\n\n\nby\n\n\n\nColm Ahern\n\n\n\non October 17, 2013\n\n\n\nSurrounded by sheets of paper, I notice that my normally adequate handwriting has descended into an output of unintelligible scribbles. With my mobile phone in one hand and a Biro in the other, I furiously scrawl pictures that a primary school teacher would throw in the bin – but I’m not here to become the next breakout artist, I’m here to decipher the puzzles of Device 6.\n\n\n\nDevice 6 is like the “difficult second album” for Simogo. Even though they’ve been developing iOS titles since 2011, Year Walk, released earlier this year, was a defining moment for them, and for mobile gaming as a whole. It’s pretty incredible, then, that they’ve managed to do it again with Device 6.\n\n\n\nAnna wakes up in a peculiar place that she doesn’t recognise, and she’s none too happy about it. As the story’s protagonist, her main goal is to, firstly, figure out where she is and then get as far away from there as possible. However, as you tap your way through six chapters, it becomes clear that everything isn’t as it seems and there’s much more to Anna’s story than meets the eye.\n\n\n\nThe main objective within each episode is to solve the many puzzles in front of you, and keep advancing the tale of Anna’s escape from this surreal situation. The narrative is largely told through on-screen text that becomes more and more intriguing as you scroll through. Unravelling the bizarre nature of Device 6 and its cast of characters is made all the more engrossing because it is exquisitely written. With class and aplomb, the language is of such a high standard in this interactive novella that reading the next chapter is the best possible reward for resolving the (at-first-glance) unresolvable challenges.\n\n\n\nAs the words are being displayed, arrows will appear, directing you toward the next area to swipe toward. Flipping your phone/tablet sideways is also a requirement as Device 6 doesn’t adhere to any iOS rules that other applications may conform to. There are occasions where branching paths will give off the illusion that you’ve jumped into a Choose Your Own Adventure book, but these avenues are just more points of interest where clues may appear. I say that because each level has something akin to a cul-de-sac – primarily a locked door of some kind, equipped with an odd keypad. This results in players going back over old ground in order to pick up on subtle clues that they may have missed, which pertain to the sealed exit. Hints occur everywhere; they can be hidden within the passages, the scattered images, or they can be audible cues that happen at specific points within that particular chapter. Device 6 expects you to be attentive and take note, literally. Trying to retain every bit of a stage’s information is almost impossible, so that’s why a pen is just as important as an iPhone for Device 6.\n\n\n\nAlthough, paranoia quickly sets in and you would be forgiven for writing down every possible thing you come across. The kooky setting is something that Simogo play with, wonderfully. As so many items of interest are unconventional, the strangest plot devices might not even relate to the puzzle’s answer at all. However, they might – and thus, a vicious circle of doubt takes hold, affecting your judgement and forcing you to involuntarily\n\n\n\nsketch frantic little doodles that may or may or may not be of use later.\n\n\n\nJust like their previous efforts, it’s tough – there’s no doubt about that. There were a few moments (one in particular), where I was completely stumped and advancing didn’t even appear to be an option. However, while Device 6 has the power to make you lose all faith in your mental capacity, it can also reassure you of your genius capabilities. Like any good puzzler, the most euphoric moment is in the build-up to the resolution – when you know you’ve got it. Device 6 achieves this because of its formidable trials. But, it still must be said that the later challenges are pretty unforgiving and will lead some people to frustration.\n\n\n\nVERDICT: Mobile gaming is sneered at because of the copious amounts of shovelware readily available on all app stores. Yet, to determine the platform as nothing more than second-rate is to discredit the work of a developer such as Simogo. Ever exceeding expectations, the developer has followed up one of 2013’s highlights with another title that can be classed as such. With a compelling story that keeps you guessing, and a pin-point utilisation of the platform, Device 6 is an accomplishment in games design, mobile or otherwise.\n\n\n\nSUPERB. This is the mark of greatness, only awarded to games that engage us from start to finish. Titles that score 9/10 will have very few problems or negative issues, and will deliver high quality and value for money across all aspects of their design.\n\n\n\nOur Scoring Policy\n\n\n\niOS\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nDevice 6 Simogo\n\n\n\nColm Ahern\n\n\n\nHow\'s things? I\'m the video guy and would love if you\'d watch the things I do like Debatable and For Your Amusement. I spend the majority of my days explaining why The Wire is the greatest TV show ever and clamouring for a Pop-Punk revival(c. 1994) whilst singing in my best Axl Rose-esque voice. Do not say professional wrestling is “fake” around me or, he’ll bore you with, what I like to call, “the risks they take”.

As you move her around the game's environments, the story and the central mystery unfold as one - and it makes for some of the finest iPhone gaming moments in recent memory.\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\nDevice 6 looks like nothing else - a maze of text where a single sentence will take you around corners, send you trailing back on yourself, and give handfuls of strange, interactive glimpses of the game's peculiar universe. The whole thing's a joy to look at, and well-designed puzzles make it a joy to play too, as you crack codes, hunt for secrets, and slowly reconstruct your own past.\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nWhen the adventure's this exciting, you can't help but wish for more. Device 6 will keep you busy for an afternoon, but it will almost certainly leave you wanting more at the end of it all.\n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\nSimogo's come up with another unmissable game - an ingenious slice of puzzling adventure that's as imaginative as it is stylish.

But the humble text adventure hasn\'t really changed much since\n\n\n\nZork\n\n\n\n. Maybe that\'s why, outside of indie IF and amateur Twine creations, the genre has lain dormant for decades.\n\n\n\nBut Swedish indie studio Simogo, which last made eerie wander-\'em-up\n\n\n\nYear Walk\n\n\n\n, has given the forgotten genre a new lease of life in psychological sci-fi thriller\n\n\n\nDEVICE 6\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nInstead of splitting the text into pages or putting separate rooms on separate screens, the game\'s narrative is laid out like a map and the words conform to the shape and size of amnesic hero Anna\'s current location.\n\n\n\nA painting of an orange hung on the wall\n\n\n\nLong, thin, single-line paragraphs are used to describe Anna walking down corridors, while descriptions of rooms fit into neat little squares and rectangles.\n\n\n\nText might bend if a hallway takes a sharp right turn, which means you must physically tilt your iPhone to follow the text. Sentences might split off in various directions as Anna comes to crossroads or multiple doors, and you can follow one sentence before doubling back on yourself to follow the other.\n\n\n\nIt\'s an ingenious way to frame an adventure game, and gives you the feeling of a decrypt text adventure or a gamebook, while also giving the world a real sense of place.\n\n\n\nYou don\'t type ""Go East"" or turn to page 54 to walk to your right. You just swipe right. And it leaves Simogo to describe the surreal locations, from a nuclear test facility to an abandoned chapel, without having to write about all the possible doors, exits, and pathways.\n\n\n\nA peculiar safe box had been placed on the floor\n\n\n\nWhile the navigation is daring and unique, the puzzles are far more traditional. They\'re the usual logic conundrums and riddles we\'ve seen in games like\n\n\n\nThe Room\n\n\n\nand Simogo\'s own\n\n\n\nYear Walk\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nSo you might come across a computer that can take a four-digit number, and you\'ve got to scour the environment for possible passwords.\n\n\n\nThe clues for each puzzle might be hidden in the text, shown in the black and white images that flank the sentences, or even read out over gramophones and tape recorders.\n\n\n\nBut while they might be traditional, they are exceptionally well-made puzzles that require clever, multi-step solutions, a notepad, and some other hardware that we won\'t spoil.\n\n\n\nThey are some of the smartest puzzles since Cing\'s DS games - better than anything in\n\n\n\nYear Walk\n\n\n\n- and they\'ll make you feel like a genius when you finally figure out the answers.\n\n\n\nThe men\'s room was locked\n\n\n\nThe navigation is also in service to the story, which is heavily inspired by \'60s TV show\n\n\n\nThe Prisoner\n\n\n\nbut with a little (heavy-handed) social commentary thrown in for good measure. Its unanswered questions are enough to keep you pressing on, at least.\n\n\n\nThe game\'s presentation must also be mentioned. The game has a diverse soundtrack - including dreamy muzak, eerie organ rock, spy movie jazz, languid strings, and moments of silence save for gravel crunching beneath Anna\'s feet - that fits the game perfectly.\n\n\n\nThe visual design is also a great fit. The actual game is more about function than form - it\'s just a readable font on parchment paper. But the Penguin-style book covers that start every chapter, and the stark and colourful tests that end them, look fantastic.\n\n\n\nDEVICE 6\n\n\n\nis a welcome addition to a genre we thought was dead and buried. It\'s got an engrossing narrative, and an ingenious design that makes the world easy and enjoyable to navigate. And on top of that, it\'s got a series of truly excellent puzzles.\n\n\n\nWhat\'s this?\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nDEVICE 6\n\n\n\nMark Brown | 17 October 2013\n\n\n\nFollow @britishgaming\n\n\n\nIn turning a text adventure into a world map, Simogo has resurrected a long-dead genre with style and confidence.

Your head hurts. Judging from the view from a window, you’re in a tower. You head downstairs, open a door, and turn. At least, that’s what your character, Anna, is experiencing; for you, the player, things are just as disorienting.\n\n\n\nYou see Anna’s story displayed on your screen in text. You swipe down as you read, and see a small graphic of a window inset into the text. As Anna sees that she’s in a tower and makes out a lighthouse, you’ve scrolled the text down far enough for that lighthouse to appear in the window frame. The words stack like stairs as she begins her descent. When she opens the door at the bottom and heads to the right, the text turns as well – and you turn your iPad to keep up. You never take direct control of Anna. Instead, you swipe along branching paths of text, solving puzzles and reading about her fate along the way.\n\n\n\nSimogo Games’ horror title Year Walk showed that a modern game could effectively provide scares without relying on gross-out visuals or overly complex gameplay. The mobile release also cleverly played with the concept of apps, with an optional free companion providing valuable insight into Year Walk’s folklore and help for puzzles. Device 6 shows a continued fascination with both the peculiarities of mobile gaming and an even more stripped-down approach to adventure.\n\n\n\nI’d advise you to play with a notebook nearby; there are loads of little details sprinkled throughout, and even things that seem insignificant can be critically useful later on. Chapters are short enough that backtracking (or reading) isn’t bothersome. Puzzles are tricky without being needlessly obscure. Because each chapter is self-contained, you usually have access to everything you need to complete each one within a few minutes. Of course, that assumes that you’ve been paying close attention. The puzzles are stripped down as much as the visuals, usually only requiring button presses between two options. They’re no less satisfying than those with full visual inventories, however, and my internal “Hell yeah!” moments were just as loud as in any other puzzle-heavy game.\n\n\n\nOnce you complete a chapter, Simogo doesn’t exactly break the fourth wall, as much as it presses firmly against it. There are a lot of clever things going on within (and outside of) the game’s story, and I hate to ruin it for prospective players. Without going into detail, I will say that I loved the regular pendulum swing between drollness and desperation.\n\n\n\nSound is used to great effect throughout the game. Device 6 opens with a jazzy tune that would be perfect for most retro spy movies, and espionage-inspired audio elements are retained throughout the game. Many of the recordings that you hear in the game reminded me of those mysterious numbers stations heard on shortwave radios. There are light touches throughout, too. Anna leaves crunching footsteps as players scroll, and sound effects seemed to have been timed perfectly for when my eyes would hit the appropriate moment. It’s a visually sparse experience, and the audio helps to fill in some of those atmospheric gaps.\n\n\n\nI wasn’t expecting to discover that one of my new favorite point-and-click adventure games would feature so little pointing and clicking, but that’s what Device 6 has done. I felt more than a little silly rotating my iPad around to read Anna along a new path, but her story was worth it in the end.\n\n\n\n8.75\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nGame Informer's Review System\n\n\n\nConcept\n\n\n\nSolve the mystery of how you got to a strange island through a clever blend of animated text, sound effects, and puzzles\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\n\nWords are your building blocks, with little animated videos and other visuals serving as the mortar\n\n\n\nSound\n\n\n\nEffects are timed to ratchet up the unsettling atmosphere, and are used sparingly.

Average based on 2 ratings\n\n\n\nWhat if instead of stepping through the looking glass, Alice fell through a stylish ‘60s-style mirror into a topsy-turvy world full of talking dolls, mysterious strangers, and intricate puzzles? Simogo, the indie creators of Year Walk , have created just such a scenario in their new iOS adventure game DEVICE 6 , an interactive text mystery with unique mechanics that will have you reading, puzzling, swiping, and turning the phone around as you play. It’s every bit as odd as it sounds, but it features fun and challenging puzzles, even if its story and gameplay never quite adhere together as well as they should.\n\n\n\nYou meet Anna as she awakes in a room that doesn\'t seem to be the same one promised to her by her landlady… Wait. Let\'s back up a bit. You\'ll actually start the game as you, the player (in my case, I was Player249). You\'ll be asked to do a variety of things to ""test your engagement"" with Device 6 (though you’re never really given any understandable explanation for what this device actually is) before being introduced to Anna, and then again at the end of each chapter. This includes holding the phone in front of your face for a ""scan,"" answering a number of multiple choice questions such as what shape you think a particular chapter is, and stumbling across instructions not related to Anna\'s adventure, such as notes pointing to previous devices (""read the Device 4 manual for important information about electromagnetic waves.""). Though the interruptions can be fun, I didn\'t really see that doing any of these things actually gathered information or changed my gameplay in any way.\n\n\n\nBut back to the story proper. Anna\'s exploration through such locations as a tower, a garden, and a lighthouse are revealed to you via text. As she investigates and attempts to escape her environs, you\'ll read through the text and swipe to read further. Traveling further into the looking glass, however, the text begins to slip sideways and swirl around as Anna traipses down staircases, or it will move up vertically as she discovers new paths. You\'ll even need to find a new way of looking at the text to make sense of its strange presentation at times. Though the story is told in the third-person, Anna\'s thoughts intrude into the narrative as side text throughout the story, letting you know that she\'s desperately hungry or hates the music that\'s playing. Outside of these small asides, however, you won\'t really get much more insight into Anna\'s motivations or her background. Little clues let you know that she is not exactly safe or anywhere close to the normal reality she remembers before falling asleep: An animatronic bear repeats the phrase, ""I don\'t know who to trust anymore,"" and barnyard animal parts make inglorious entrances into delicious dessert treats.\n\n\n\nWhile most of the story is revealed through text, there are photos interspersed throughout. I played this on my iPhone, so the images were small as they shared space with text. Some of these images, like a stern-looking elephant wearing a bowler hat, are static. Others change as you swipe across the screen, making it appear as though you are moving past an open window. You’ll also stumble across schematic drawings and watch as lines and circles grow and move across the screen as you solve puzzles, sometimes indicating where you should read next. Some images have interactive elements where you can tap the screen to enter codes and attempt to open locked doors. You’ll encounter more than just doors to interact with, however, as one object that screamed long and loud (literally) when I pressed it can attest to.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, you won\'t always know what to do with these interactive elements the first time you come across them. Once you\'ve reached the end of a chapter and figured out how to solve a puzzle, you\'ll need to backtrack (including scrolling sideways and turning your phone around and around) to get back to the interactive hotspot. This becomes especially challenging because the text branches in multiple, nonlinear ways, so at times I found myself scrolling all the way to the right only to realize that the hotspot was actually all the way to the left. It would have helped if the developers had come up with a more seamless way of interacting with elements sitting far apart from each other on the written screen.\n\n\n\nOne nice immersive element is that you won\'t be doing all of this reading in silence. As you swipe across the screen you\'ll hear footsteps, the sound of a man shouting at you from the bottom of a well, a door slowly creaking open, a crowded hall full of plates clinking and people talking. Various revelations that Anna experiences in the text are often accompanied by background music suddenly sounding, providing an additional layer of tension. And you\'ll need to pay attention to the various recordings that you hear, whether it\'s the sound of a voice coming out of a stuffed bear or a tinny recording played in a room full of mannequins sitting down to dinner. You\'ll also get odd musical interludes like a hopped up, synthesized ""Flight of the Valkyries.""\n\n\n\nIt should go without saying in an adventure that as you explore, you\'ll need to carefully observe everything you discover. Whether it\'s a small detail in a photo or a description of a group of people, often the codes you\'ll need to crack require either a good memory or great note-taking skills or even a little math (as well as patience as you scroll back through the text to reread a section or re-examine an image). The absurd nature of this alternate reality makes it all the more challenging, as almost everything you encounter is abnormal and could be clue. Did I need to pay heed to that priest with a gramophone for a head? How about those random schematics that appear with phrases like ""present tense to past translation output""?\n\n\n\nThe game is broken up into six chapters, five of which require you to solve large, multilayered puzzles as you aid Anna in searching for a way out of this surreal nightmare. Anna’s experiences become more bizarre – from waking up at what appears to be her own funeral, to finding herself in a dark woods surrounded by a flock of screaming, shrieking sheep, to sitting in a theater with a man singing a single song over and over again – and she becomes increasingly angered at whatever mysterious entity might be putting her through all of these tests.\n\n\n\nThe feeling of being tested is further amplified by all of the puzzles you encounter. There are no inventory puzzles, although you will pick up a mask at one point that will alter how you see your environment when you put it on. This particular puzzle involves remembering items that you encounter both with your mask on and with it off. As you progress further into the game, the puzzles become more convoluted. It got to the point for me that I was so busy going back and forth trying to remember what details were simply part of the story and which were clues for puzzles that I often lost the flow of the story entirely.\n\n\n\nDuring my two hours of playing time, I ultimately stopped trying to make too much sense of a tale that had Lord Nelson, Napoleon, and General Custer all sitting at the same table, and I did what Anna did as she ""calmed down and giggled at the absurdity of it all."" I did enjoy the intricate puzzles and the general sense of oddness and menace that the game conveyed. The novel interaction between you, the text, and the images was a nice break from your typical text adventure or casual gaming experience. However, the need to constantly scroll back and forth made the overall presentation disjointed, lacking in immersion, and at times just plain annoying. A more visual presentation could have made the backtracking feel much more like you were exploring a physical space. As it was, I felt as if I were rewinding a bit of tape, which is hardly the best solution for keeping the flow of a story going in this, the digital age.\n\n\n\nI never really did understand why Anna was locked in this dreamlike prison full of locked puzzles and codes the first time I played through, and I found it hard to see what her experiences had to do with my own experiences as Player249. My scrolling back and forth and feverish puzzle-solving the first go-round made Anna’s descent into an increasingly nonsensical and dangerous world seem like one large jumble of surreal scenarios. Reading through the story a second time without worrying about finding puzzle clues allowed me to piece together the larger narrative in addition to enjoying each chapter on its own bizarre terms. For me, being unable to fully appreciate the larger story during my first playthrough made me feel like the developers were just on the brink of achieving a truly awesome interactive experience but didn’t quite make it. As it is, DEVICE 6 is certainly an interesting entry into the iOS adventure realm, but could have used some better integration of story and puzzling. Perhaps it would make a little more sense with a Device 7 upgrade.\n\n\n\nWhat our readers think of DEVICE 6\n\n\n\nNo reader reviews yet...

Thomas\n\n\n\nYou know you watched it.\n\n\n\nIt was your favorite guilty pleasure. It aired on the Lifetime network in the \'90s. It was the game show that birthed your dreams of running wild in a grocery store -- it was Supermarket Sweep. The sensational shopping cart free-for-all to find and grab as many everyday items as possible was a cult classic on cable, and even kept new episodes airing all the way up until 2004. Sadly, it\'s since been cancelled -- but now, here to fill the gap, is Mart Racer .\n\n\n\nMart Racer is the latest racing game to come to Nintendo\'s digital download WiiWare service, and it\'s thematically right in line with the good old Supermarket Sweep show. It tasks you to take command of a happy couple and a shopping cart, run crazy through the aisles of convenience stores and mega-marts, pick up a pre-selected set of six different items and then get back to the checkout counter first (before the other, competing teams can do the same).\n\n\n\nIt\'s essentially Mario Kart \'s multiplayer battle mode made into the focus of a full game, as you\'ll drive, dash and drift your way through freezer aisles and produce sections while simultaneously warring against your rivals -- your weapons being standard comical fare like projectile-attacking plungers, oil-slick-making bottles of canola and enormous, oversized football helmets that serve as shields from the assaults of the opposition.\n\n\n\nVegetables, eh? Even the video game world is going organic.\n\n\n\nIt all sounds pretty good. It\'s not.\n\n\n\nMart Racer\'s theme and premise will certainly resonate with some, especially those who once watched and enjoyed the Supermarket Sweep game show. But after you get past any initial excitement, you won\'t find much to keep that smile on your face.\n\n\n\nThe first issue is control. A common complaint with Wii games, and particularly WiiWare releases -- but unfortunately a valid one here. The default control setting has you holding the Remote sideways, twisting it forward and back to accelerate while also turning it left and right to turn, slide and drift. It\'s a tough sell on concept alone, and then it\'s made worse by the fact that it always feels like the calibration is off.\n\n\n\nYou\'ll find yourself slamming your cart into the side of an aisle and coming to a dead stop frequently, then it won\'t respond when you try to turn around and go the other way. If that\'s meant to be a simulation of the old ""one wobbly wheel"" that you always seem to get stuck with at real supermarkets, then it\'s doing a good job of evoking the same feelings of frustration.\n\n\n\nA second control scheme that takes away the motion elements and just lets you use the D-Pad saves the game in the short run, but then it only offers you other disappointments -- like the second issue, slowdown. Some of Mart Racer\'s expansive supermarket levels are apparently a bit too packed full of people and products for the game to handle, and the framerate suffers as a result. You\'ll chug along, dealing with the choppy frame-skipping, for sometimes the entire duration of a race. Which is unfortunate, because the game\'s visuals (and cel-shaded style) wouldn\'t be all that bad otherwise.\n\n\n\nThird up, lack of variety in gameplay. Mart Racer presents 12 different levels, but the experience is pretty much the same throughout all of them -- run and get the items, get back to the checkout counter. There\'s no functional difference to going after groceries versus seeking out clothing, or whatever else it has you going on a wild goose chase about in any given stage.\n\n\n\n""Price check, Aisle 1. One goth girl. No barcode on her.""\n\n\n\nFourth, lack of challenge. You\'ll never lose a race in single-player, because the computer-controlled opponents are too dumb.\n\n\n\nFifth, inflated price tag. This is a game that should have shipped at the 500 Wii Point low end of the WiiWare spectrum, instead of making the grab for eight bucks.\n\n\n\nSixth, Nintendo WiFi Connection. Now you\'d think this would be a redeeming feature, and it\'s certainly an admirable inclusion -- few developers go the extra mile to include online multiplayer support in their WiiWare releases. It\'s just an empty promise in Mart Racer, though. No one else is online looking for a match, so even though the functionality is supposedly there you\'ll never be able to use it.\n\n\n\n. . . and I think six is enough. For such a simple and easy-to-understand concept, Mart Racer\'s very quick to rack up an imposing list of flaws and faults that, even more quickly, drain almost all the fun out of the design. Most of these are issues that could have been addressed pretty easily before Mart Racer was released to the public, but in the grand tradition of WiiWare the decision makers in charge of this one decided to offer a basically unfinished product to us instead.\n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\nIf you\'re like me, Supermarket Sweep was a fun and inoffensive daytime diversion back in the \'90s -- the sort of game show you flipped on when you were home sick from school, or watched while eating your lunch in the summertime when taking a break from getting into trouble outside. This game might have some appeal for you if you can relate, but don\'t let that actually compel you to purchase it --\n\n\n\nMart Racer\n\n\n\nis much better left to sit on the shelf.\n\n\n\nI do, however, recommend you click over to YouTube and check out some of the old Sweep episodes to be found there. Makes me want to go run over other shoppers in the aisles right now.\n\n\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\nMart Racer\n\n\n\nReleased Sep. 14th, 2009\n\n\n\nWii\n\n\n\nBad\n\n\n\n24 Sep 2009\n\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nRead our review standards\n\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\nPresentation\n\n\n\nThe theme is fun, and brings up memories of cult classic game shows like Supermarket Sweep. Some odd choices are made, though, like sending you straight back to the title screen after every race.\n\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\n\nAverage at best. Mart Racer\'s cel-shaded style works well enough, but in motion you\'ll frequently get slowdown and dropped frames.\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nSound\n\n\n\nFair effects work and background music.\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nGameplay\n\n\n\nA mostly poor racing design that adapts a battle mode concept into an entire game. Motion control is dreadful, but the game isn\'t compelling with the alternate D-Pad control either.\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nLasting Appeal\n\n\n\nLimited and repetitive. Mart Racer offers 12 different levels with varied themes, but they all end up being essentially the same thing. You\'d be done with this game faster than a single real grocery t\n\n\n\nBuying Guide\n\n\n\nPowered by IGN Deals\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\nDick Grayson and Jason Todd Face Off in Our Exclusive Titans First Look\n\n\n\nAssassin\'s Creed Odyssey DLC Plan Announced\n\n\n\nFirst Man Review\n\n\n\nWhy It\'s Insane That Warner Bros.

At the risk of making heretical statements, Ghost Trick outshines these previous efforts as a triumph of storytelling, gameplay, and presentation. From start to finish it cannot be put down, and years from the hardware\'s release it utilizes the Nintendo DS\'s core functionality as if the system were built for it.\n\n\n\nIn Ghost Trick you play as Sissel, a man who woke up to find that not only has he been murdered, but that he\'s also forgotten everything about who he is and how he was killed. Now a free-floating spirit, he encounters another restless soul residing in a desk lamp. The spirit, who calls himself Ray (short for ""Ray of Light""), points out another murder victim, a young woman named Lynne. Ray tells Sissel that if he wants to solve the mysteries of his life and death he needs to save Lynne, because she is the key to unraveling the mystery. More importantly, he has to do it tonight because at dawn his spirit will disappear forever.\n\n\n\nThat\'s you in the chair. Dead.\n\n\n\nEach chapter in Ghost Trick involves Sissel saving the life of someone connected to the mystery of his identity. To do this, he must determine both how the victim was killed, and how to save them. Being a ghost does have some advantages, as he is able to go back in time four minutes prior to a body\'s death in order to change their fate.\n\n\n\nSissel can enter ""Ghost Mode"" by clicking a button on the touch screen. In Ghost Mode, time stops and he can move between objects within a limited range of his current position. He can also communicate with the spirits of the dead, or those of people he has saved from death earlier. Outside of Ghost Mode time progresses, but he can use his ""Ghost Tricks"" to interact with the item he is possessing, making the item perform a specific action (turn on a light, open a door, roll a ball, etc.). Each move he makes changes the narrative of the victim\'s final minutes, and can buy him some time. If time runs out he fails, and as a result the victim is killed, he then has to rewind time again and start over.\n\n\n\nSissel moving in Ghost Mode. He is going to turn on that siren and be a nuisance.\n\n\n\nThe entire game is a series of environmental puzzles. Sissel always knows what the final objective is, and understands how the victim was killed. It\'s his job to use his powers to change the environment to alter the victim\'s fate. One puzzle tasks him with preventing a sniper from killing Lynne, which he does by using lights to illuminate the various places the sniper uses to hide and forcing him to the only secluded spot remaining, under the heavy payload of a crane. One flip of the crane\'s control levers and the assassin isn\'t a threat anymore.\n\n\n\nThe DS works perfectly with the game as all controls can be executed using only the stylus. The only actions to perform are either drawing lines to move Sissel, or clicking an on-screen button to make him perform his Ghost Tricks.\n\n\n\nDespite the similar objectives and limited number of tasks Sissel can perform, the game never feels like it has outstayed its welcome. It waits until just before all possible ideas seem to have been exhausted to introduce new mechanics. Each puzzle requires critical thinking and proper timing to successfully evade the impending danger. As the game progresses it continues to offer new and exciting challenges, and each resolution feels rewarding and serves to whet the appetite for further challenges.\n\n\n\nThat said, it would have been nice if some of the levels presented more difficult challenges. The majority of the puzzles are rather straightforward; however, the handful that require a lot of observation, planning, and thought are the most exciting to solve.\n\n\n\nGhost Trick\'s story blends well with its gameplay. A ghost story is the perfect vehicle for a game about manipulating an environment to solve puzzles. At the heart of Ghost Trick is the mystery of Sissel\'s identity. In seeking to discover who he is and why he died, Sissel discovers that he is just part of a much larger and more troubling conspiracy. Yet, the story manages to feel cool, absurd, and have a keen sense of comedic timing, all while maintaining dramatic intensity. Each twist of the plot is well-crafted, the pacing is quick, and the overall quality of storytelling is a testament to the skills of Shu Takumi and his team.\n\n\n\nThe visual style features animation reminiscent of rotoscoping techniques, resulting in movements that seem impossibly smooth for the DS. The game features dancing security guards, festive walks, moving backgrounds, and other elements that show off the title\'s accomplishments in animation. The art itself relies on bright, cell-shaded visuals and they look fantastic. It seems as if colorful pop art has sprung to life with some of the most organic movement in gaming, and the net effect is that of undeniable coolness.\n\n\n\nHis dancing is amazingly fluid, and situationally inappropriate.\n\n\n\nThe audio design is equally well executed. Like the Ace Attorney titles, the music is tense and dramatic. The effects sound right, such as hearing the sound of a door being unlocked, the knob turned, and it finally opening. While it features no voice work, players will not miss it.\n\n\n\nThe game features no multiplayer mode, but it does clock in at about 12 hours, and it is infinitely replayable. Players can select their favorite chapters from the main menu if they desire.\n\n\n\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective is a rare title. Its inventive and addicting gameplay was clearly built in such a way as to place maximum value on the DS touch screen. A compelling and engrossing story was constructed around these gameplay mechanics, and an attractive and unique visual style was created to display such a game. However, the best thing to be said about Ghost Trick is that there isn\'t much negative to say. Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is an absolutely amazing title.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\n\nAwesome gameplay\n\n\n\nGreat storytelling\n\n\n\nSlick presentation\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nToo few complex puzzles\n\n\n\nTalkback\n\n\n\nKiller_Man_Jaro\n\n\n\nTom Malina, Associate Editor (Europe)\n\n\n\nJanuary 09, 2011\n\n\n\nSweet. I had been worried that the stage reset every 4 minutes would get annoying, but you\'ve convinced me to pick this up at the end of the month. Decent length too.\n\n\n\nCrimm\n\n\n\nJames Jones, Associate Editor\n\n\n\nJanuary 09, 2011\n\n\n\nIt\'s not really 4 minutes. Often times it\'s based on how fast the action on the top screen is moving. Also, you don\'t usually need to reset time more than once and that\'s just because you need to watch how they died the first time.\n\n\n\nRagnaBlade\n\n\n\nJanuary 09, 2011\n\n\n\nHow similar is the style of humor to that of the Ace Attorney games?\n\n\n\nCrimm\n\n\n\nJames Jones, Associate Editor\n\n\n\nJanuary 09, 2011\n\n\n\nIt\'s still a ""humor of the absurd,"" but it is more restrained and used selectively. There\'s no Guy Eldoon (HIS HAIR IS NOODLES, HIS HAT A BOWL, AND HIS NAME IS NOODLE BACKWARDS) but there are characters that just seem off. There\'s a security guard who dances when he gets nervous. His partner spends many scenes beseeching him to stop. So while the scene itself is still rather tense, the on-screen action is actually quite absurd. It\'s still quite funny, but it doesn\'t roll one punch-line to the next. And it isn\'t trying to.\n\n\n\nJasonMaivia\n\n\n\nJanuary 10, 2011\n\n\n\nNice review, James. You\'ve pushed me to add this game on my ""To Buy"" list for DS.\n\n\n\nTheFleece\n\n\n\nJanuary 11, 2011\n\n\n\nI\'ve really been looking forward to this game. I like the demo that was (is?) up on the Nintendo Channel. I\'m going to pick this up to counter play me freaking out about puzzles in 999.

Also, I heart this game\n\n\n\nTalesOfFan\n\n\n\nJames Dawson, Associate Editor\n\n\n\nJanuary 16, 2011\n\n\n\nThanks for the review!

Each of the game's 15 levels introduces mission objectives that must be completed to progress to the next level. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines. Ground defenses are more varied and include battle and destroyer droids, laser and missile turrets, Armored Assault Tanks (AATs), Multi-troop transports (MTTs), gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform (STAPs).The heads-up display features a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. Depending on the level, the player can control several different air, land and water vehicles. Aircraft are the Naboo N-1 Starfighter, the Naboo Bomber and Police Cruiser, while land and watercraft are the Flash and Gian speeders, the Trade Federation Gunboat and the Heavy STAP. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft that falls within its air, land or watercraft specification. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level. Seven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft for the remainder of the game.The player's performance is measured throughout the game, and performance statistics are checked after each level against four medal benchmarks. Each benchmark contains six categories: completion time, number of enemies destroyed, shot accuracy, number of friendly craft and structures saved, number of bonuses collected and lives remaining. If a player's performance exceeds one of the level's four benchmarks in all five categories, a medal—bronze, silver, gold or platinum—is awarded on completion. Unlike other medal benchmarks, platinum medal benchmarks are undisclosed to the player. Acquiring medals promotes the player's rank and helps unlock hidden content.



=== Unlockable content ===



Battle for Naboo includes a number of unlockable secrets. The player can unlock three bonus levels: ""Trade Federation Secrets"", ""Coruscant Encounter"" and ""Dark Side"". These levels are made available when the player obtains all bronze, silver or gold medals, respectively, on every level. Alternatively, they can be unlocked via password. Several craft are also available when unlocked. The Sith Infiltrator, a Swamp Speeder and an AAT may be selected when the player enters the correct passwords or achieves all gold or platinum medals, respectively, on all levels. A TIE fighter and a playable model of a 1969 Buick Electra 225 based on a car owned by the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember, can be unlocked via password only.The development team also included early game design sketches and audio commentary for each of the game's 15 standard levels, unlockable via passwords. Each level features more than five minutes of audio that totals over an hour of commentary in all. IGN likened the ""captivating"" commentary to DVD bonus material and believed the addition could start a trend in video games. MTV reporter Stephen Totilo believes that this audio commentary ""may very well be"" the earliest in video gaming.",Star Wars Episode I: Battle for Naboo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_Battle_for_Naboo

ups and other goodies .\', \'there is a lot of interactivity in the game , between characters as well as the environments . characters can literally be combined using the character customizer which will allow you to make your own star wars characters out of any of the existing characters’ body parts . how about chewleia or darth3po ? a plethora of objects constructed out of lego blocks can be smashed and reassembled into other objects such as stairs or ramps to help you gain access to a hard - to - reach area . in this game , as opposed to the first one , the vehicles that you build such as the tie fighters and star destroyer can actually be used .\', \'another player can join in anytime and instantly access the co - op mode . there is always another ai character with you and the player will assume the role of that particular character the instant he or she enters the game . that character can then be relegated back to the ai at anytime and the main player will not be affected at all by the change . this is a well thought - out system that will encourage multi - playing with even the most inexperienced of gamers . it’s unfortunate there isn’t an online mode but considering how much is offered in this title , one can’t really complain much .\', \'the production values are good but they aren’t great . there are some camera issues but you do have more control over it than with the first game . there are some framerate hiccups but overall it’s relatively smooth going . the characters look amazing and the stages are filled with detail and depth totally befitting the lego / star wars universe – which is basically composed of shiny , plastic , material . there aren’t any voiceovers but i hope you weren’t expecting this to be voiced by the original cast . the score is obviously composed by john williams and even though you’ve heard it before , there’s nothing else that could be more fitting , save perhaps the entire orchestration performed through a shiny , plastic , casio keyboard .\', \'in a nutshell , lego star wars ii is action , adventure , collecting , puzzles , races , mini - game , co - op mode and your favorite star wars characters all having a great time . all you need is a copy of this game to join in on the fun . highly recommended for players of all ages .\', \'relive the fun in a whole new way ! the game that lets you combine the fun of lego with all the action and excitement of star wars now lets you battle through all your favorite moments in the original star wars trilogy ( episodes iv , v and vi ) .\', \'from luke and princess leia to han solo and darth vader , now play over 50 of your favorite characters in a humorous and unique lego setting .\', \'build and customize with a galaxy of new features . for the first time ever , you can build and ride new vehicles and creatures and get in and out to explore the world of the original star wars trilogy . create and customize new characters with new abilities . with even more destructible environments and more challenging puzzles , playing lego star wars has never been more fun .\', \'play with your buddies . the drop -

colored “planks” of a pirate ship or a square , boxy build of a race car , the only limitation to what you can build is the imagination . so when last year , lucasarts reached into our childhoods with their retelling of episodes one through three in lego star wars . answering the calls of countless fans , myself included , lucasarts will now retell the original trilogy in lego star wars ii : the original trilogy .\', \'starring the cast of the original trilogy , lego star wars ii will refine the formula set by its predecessor in providing fun adventure gameplay and combat while remaining fairly accessible to casual gamers . one of the most important adjustments to the “ease” in gameplay will be the adjustable difficulty . if , throughout a level perhaps , you are getting your rear handed to you by various storm troopers and the like , the game will adjust its difficulty down to allow players to continue making progress through the game instead of giving up in frustration . on the other hand , if you are slaughtering everything you come across without so much as a ding , which may have been the case for some players of the original , then the difficulty will ratchet upwards to keep play interesting .\', \'lego star wars allowed players to play as their favorite characters throughout the game and unlock countless goodies , but the original trilogy will go one better by allowing players to customize their character with interchangeable parts . that’s right , you can have the head of princess leia on the body of han solo carrying a light - saber while donning darth vader’s black cape . lucasarts will be rewarding owners of the original by using their save files to unlock the original unlockable characters . including the original characters , over 100 characters will be accessible in the original trilogy , including luke , lando , greedo , and every other memorable character imaginable .\', \'the customization doesn’t end there either . like in the original , players will construct different vehicles throughout the game to accomplish goals and clear levels . this time around , however , all non - droid characters will be able to construct vehicles from parts strewn across the stage . these pieces will be found behind obstacles and whatnot , requiring various character skills to access . additionally , hidden model kit pieces will be hidden in each of the levels throughout the trilogy , allowing you to use custom vehicles , which aren’t found by default in game , through specific stages .\', \'character specific combat and moves will be expanded upon , making the difference between playing as han solo and chewbacca two completely different gameplay experiences . while vader may be able to use a force choke - hold to defeat opponents , chewbacca will be adept at ripping the lego arms off of stormtroopers . as stated above , various characters will be able to solve specific puzzles as well . chewbacca’s brute strength would be useless in a specific stage , for instance , where luke’s force abilities would be required .\', \'these improvements and more , such as bigger level designs and a more competent camera system , will ensure that fans of the original will be more than satisfied by the lego telling of episodes four through six . look for the lego pieces to start flying late this summer .\', ""steam now selling uncensored adult games pubg drops to under one million players nintendo announces nintendo switch pokemon bundles breaking down the best of sony’s pre -

friendly action adventure game that inexplicably rendered the exploits of young anakin skywalker and obi - wan kenobi to look as though they were made out of lego building blocks . it was a curious combination , but it worked because the gameplay was novel enough , the combined nostalgia for star wars and legos was potent , and the experience was delivered with a humorous , lighthearted flair . lego star wars ii is an even better package than the original , due almost entirely to the fact that the emotional connection to a new hope , empire strikes back , and return of the jedi is much stronger for most people ."", \'t works best as a nostalgia piece , but lego star wars ii is good fun on its own .\', \'you start out in the mos eisley cantina , which serves as a hub from which you can access all three episodes , as well as a counter where you can purchase extras like cheats and additional playable characters , and a new character creation counter . initially you \\\' ll have access only to a new hope , though you \\\' ll gain access to empire and jedi after beating the first chapter . the game hits nearly all of the most memorable sequences from all three films , and it does it all with a goofy sense of humor . since the game will no doubt attract some hardcore star wars fans , it \\\' s also worth noting that lego star wars ii seems to be taking most of its cues from the original theatrical releases . this means you can expect han to shoot first , darth vader to have eyebrows , and return of the jedi to end with the classic "" yub yub "" ewok song . they \\\' re all minor points , but it \\\' s the kind of stuff that fans will definitely appreciate .\', ""lego star wars ii is still primarily an action adventure game in which you control a group of characters as they blast their way through enemies and do some light puzzle - solving and the occasional platform - jumping . the size of your group expands and contracts regularly , growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times . you control only one character at a time , and you can switch characters easily on the fly . your artificial intelligence - controlled companions are pretty worthless , save for a few specific scripted sequences . there \' s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters , which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed . usually , though , the characters you \' re dragging around are there for a reason , as there are several different classes of characters , each with unique abilities that you \' ll need to progress . jedi characters sport lightsabers , can perform double - jumps , and can use their force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment . regular hero characters like princess leia and han solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot . c3po and r2d2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment , and r2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances . short characters like jawas and ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas ."", ""these character classes were all in the original , though they \' ve been tweaked slightly . all nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of legos into usable devices , something that originally only jedi were capable of ; many blaster - wielding characters will now auto - dodge incoming blaster fire ; and most characters now have unique melee attacks - - it \' s great to watch chewie rip a stormtrooper \' s arms right out of their sockets or to see lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were ryu . not only do all these refinements make non - jedi characters more useful , they also lend the game a bit more personality . new to lego star wars ii are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters . since you \' ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode , you \' ll have to rely on special helmet machines , which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter . it \' s a fragile ruse , though , because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off . the bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators , which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects ."", ""lego star wars ii puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original . you \' ll happen upon small carts , landspeeders , and at - sts that you can pilot in the action adventure chapters , though there are also chapters dedicated to memorable sequences like destroying both of the death stars , fighting off imperial forces in your snowspeeder on hoth , and racing speeder bikes through the forests of endor . these dedicated vehicle chapters make the game feel more epic and break up the action nicely , but hoth has been done to death already , and some of the sequences aren \' t as visceral as you might like . this is due largely to a stiff camera , something that occasionally hampers the action adventure levels as well . the camera usually stays in a fixed position , and though you \' re allowed a little wiggle room , there are a few specific points where it \' s easy to get stuck because the path is obscured ."", ""there \' s no dedicated multiplayer component to lego star wars ii , though it does offer cooperative play , and at any point a second player can just jump right in . it works seamlessly and reduces the number of generally useless ai companions , but it \' s also disappointing that no version of lego star wars ii features online co - op . whether you \' re playing alone or with a friend , lego star wars ii is easy . as long as you \' re pointing in the general direction , blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own , and death is barely punished with a small loss of money . it should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around , but there \' s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back ."", ""once you play through a level in the story mode , you can play it again in free play mode , which gives you some control over which characters you \' ll play as , and you \' ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn \' t get to with the story mode characters . you \' ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game , but there are others that you \' ll need to purchase in the shop , and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original lego star wars , if it appeared on the system you \' re playing on . the free play mode also lets you use your own custom - made characters , which you can build using pieces of other playable characters . it doesn \' t effect the gameplay , but there \' s still something really funny about putting darth vader \' s head on princess leia \' s body when she \' s in her slave costume . several different types of collectibles , an unlockable series of bounty hunter missions , and time trial mode all help to create some good lasting value ."", \'though the game is appearing on no less than eight different platforms , most of these versions are virtually indistinguishable . featurewise , the gamecube , playstation 2 , xbox , xbox 360 , and pc versions of lego star wars ii are nearly identical , and the psp version is awfully close , though it takes a slightly different approach to certain unlockables , and it also has much more pronounced loading times . the current - gen console versions all look slightly better than the original lego star wars , while the pc version looks a bit better than those , since it can run at much higher resolutions . by default , the pc version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme , though it’s easily modified . there’s also gamepad support , and we found that a wired xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons .\', \'the character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations .\', ""the xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair , with better reflections , better explosions , and a cool lens - focus effect that makes objects too close to or too far from the camera appear slightly blurry . it \' s definitely the best - looking version , but it \' s also got a very minor frame rate problem that crops up when there are a lot of particle effects . the achievement points in the xbox 360 version are pretty well balanced . you’ll probably get almost 200 points just by playing through all three episodes , though there is also a string of achievements that require you to complete entire chapters without dying once , which in some cases is no small feat ."", ""regardless of the platform , though , the visuals have a ton of charm . getting to see recognizable lego pieces mingling with recognizable star wars characters and locales is just really endearing , and lego star wars ii does it quite well . a vast library of recognizable sound effects and that unshakably rousing john williams score make the experience feel that much more authentic , and even though there \' s no real voice acting in the game , some miming and appropriate - sounding mumbles make it apparent what \' s going on ."", ""as much fun as lego star wars ii is , it \' s unfortunate that it had to come second . some of the novelty of the gameplay , as well as the concept itself , isn \' t quite as potent as it was the first time around . the original star wars trilogy just seems more deserving of this nostalgic treatment than the prequels . still , anyone with even a sliver of nostalgia for star wars will find this to be a fun , good -

person perspective , and takes place in a 3d game world that contains objects , environments and characters designed to resemble lego pieces . its gameplay—a combination of the action - adventure , platform , and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of lego star wars : the video game ( 2005 ) . while lego star wars followed the events of the phantom menace ( 1999 ) , attack of the clones ( 2002 ) , and revenge of the sith ( 2005 ) , lego star wars ii is based on star wars ( 1977 ) , the empire strikes back ( 1980 ) , and return of the jedi ( 1983 ) . the game comically retells the trilogy ' s events using cutscenes without dialogue . the player assumes the roles of the films ' characters , each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities . at any time , a second player can join the game , by activating a second controller . during gameplay , players can collect lego studs – small , disk - shaped objects , that serve as the game ' s currency . the player has a health meter , which is displayed on the game ' s heads - up display . the player ' s health is represented by four hearts ; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away . however , they instantly respawn and can often re - collect the lost studs . the game ' s central location is the mos eisley cantina , a spaceport bar on the planet tatooine . at the counter , the player may use their lego studs to purchase characters , vehicles , gameplay hints and extras , or activate cheat codes . in a small area outside the cantina , players may view collected vehicles . the game is broken into levels , which are accessed from the cantina ; each film is represented by six levels , representing key locations and scenes in that film . the locations include hoth , bespin , dagobah , tatooine , the death star , and endor . the game also features bonus levels . during levels , the player defeats enemies , builds objects out of lego bricks and drives vehicles , certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles , including a tie fighter , a snowspeeder , and the millennium falcon . levels must first be played in story mode . this unlocks the next level as well as a free play mode for the recently completed level . gameplay is identical in the two modes . however , story mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on , while free play offers all those unlocked . levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items . three types of secret items are available : gold bricks , minikits , and power bricks . within each level is hidden one power brick . when a power brick is collected , its corresponding extra , such as invincibility or stud multipliers , becomes available for purchase . each level also contains ten hidden minikits , that is , ten pieces of a star wars vehicle . when all ten have been collected , the player is awarded a gold brick . collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards , such as a spigot that spews out studs . gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed , and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level ; ninety - nine gold bricks are available . the vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina . as each vehicle is completed ( all ten minikits collected ) , it becomes available for play in a bonus level .



 == playable characters == 



over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game , including variations of luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , chewbacca , lando calrissian , r2 - d2 , c - 3po , darth vader , wicket the ewok , and boba fett . character abilities have a greater role in lego star wars ii than in lego star wars . certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas . characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles , double jump and use the force . r2 - d2 , c - 3po , and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors . small characters like the ewok and jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas . bounty hunters , such as boba fett , may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects . sith , like darth vader , can use the force to manipulate black lego objects . some characters have unique abilities ; for example , chewbacca can rip enemies ' arms from their sockets , darth vader can choke enemies with the force , princess leia possesses a slap attack , and lando calrissian can use a kung - fu - like attack . special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets , and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities . this means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode . the player can unlock the "" use old save "" extra , which imports all unlocked characters from lego star wars for use in free play ; however , a lego star wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains lego star wars ii ' s save data . players can create two customized characters in the mos eisley cantina . these characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters ; 2 , 258 , 163 , 204 combinations are possible . entering two cheat codes , publicized by ign , makes pieces for a santa claus character available . the game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used ( for example , a character made from pieces of darth vader and c - 3po might have the name "" darth - 3po "" ) ; alternately , the player may create a name .",lego star wars ii : the original trilogy,"['doctype html\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nSkip to sections navigation\n\n\n\nSkip to content\n\n\n\nSkip to footer\n\n\n\nOur network\n\n\n\nSubscribe Log In\n\n\n\nOpen\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nSubscribe -\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nclose\n\n\n\nSearch Site\n\n\n\nSections\n\n\n\nNetwork\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nSydney\n\n\n\nNSW\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n\nNSW\n\n\n\nVictoria\n\n\n\nQueensland\n\n\n\nACT\n\n\n\nWestern Australia\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nThe economy\n\n\n\nMarkets\n\n\n\nCompanies\n\n\n\nBanking & finance\n\n\n\nSmall business\n\n\n\nConsumer affairs\n\n\n\nWorkplace\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nNorth America\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n\nAsia\n\n\n\nMiddle East\n\n\n\nOceania\n\n\n\nCentral America\n\n\n\nSouth America\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\n\nNational\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nVictoria\n\n\n\nQueensland\n\n\n\nACT\n\n\n\nWestern Australia\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nNRL\n\n\n\nRugby Union\n\n\n\nAFL\n\n\n\nSoccer\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nRacing\n\n\n\nMotorsport\n\n\n\nNetball\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nBasketball\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nNFL\n\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\n\nSwimming\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nSailing\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nMovies\n\n\n\nTV & Radio\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nCelebrity\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nComedy\n\n\n\nDance\n\n\n\nMusicals\n\n\n\nOpera\n\n\n\nTheatre\n\n\n\nArt & design\n\n\n\nTV guide\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nLife & relationships\n\n\n\nHealth & wellness\n\n\n\nFashion\n\n\n\nBeauty\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nSuper & retirement\n\n\n\nInvesting\n\n\n\nBanking\n\n\n\nBorrowing\n\n\n\nSaving\n\n\n\nTax\n\n\n\nPlanning & budgeting\n\n\n\nInsurance\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nConservation\n\n\n\nClimate Change\n\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\n\nWeather\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nFood & wine\n\n\n\nExecutive style\n\n\n\nToday\'s Paper\n\n\n\nFor subscribers\n\n\n\nLetters\n\n\n\nEditorial\n\n\n\nColumn 8\n\n\n\nObituaries\n\n\n\nGood Weekend\n\n\n\nQuizzes\n\n\n\nWeather\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nThe Age\n\n\n\nBrisbane Times\n\n\n\nWAtoday\n\n\n\nThe Canberra Times\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Review\n\n\n\nDomain\n\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\n\n\nAllhomes\n\n\n\nDrive\n\n\n\nGood Food\n\n\n\nTraveller\n\n\n\nExecutive Style\n\n\n\nOver Sixty\n\n\n\nEssential Baby\n\n\n\nEssential Kids\n\n\n\nFind A Babysitter\n\n\n\nThe Store\n\n\n\nWeatherzone\n\n\n\nRSVP\n\n\n\nAdzuna\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nGames\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nBy Jason Hill\n\n\n\n16 September 2006 — 10:00am\n\n\n\nNormal text size Larger text size Very large text size\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II PS2, PSP, PC, Xbox and 360, GameCube From $49.95 PG Rating: 5/5\n\n\n\nThis is one of the most entertaining games of the year, an epic Lego adventure where you will be called upon to swing lightsabres, fire blasters, pilot ships and use the Force to stop Darth Vader building his evil empire.\n\n\n\nBased on the beloved original film trilogy, Lego Star Wars II is a significant improvement on its delightful predecessor, which sold more than four million copies.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFew will be able to resist the game\'s incredible charm. The dinky characters are packed with charisma and the retelling of the story over 18 levels along with the hilarious film clips is both a loving tribute and a side-splitting parody.\n\n\n\nThanks to simple controls and the inspired decision to not penalise mistakes harshly, anyone can pick up a joypad and instantly have fun. But in response to the original\'s popularity among ""hardcore"" gamers, levels are now significantly larger and the puzzles more complex, which might mean youngsters need an occasional helping hand.\n\n\n\nFortunately, this is a perfect game for parents to enjoy with their kids. It fosters teamwork, lets players jump in and out of the action and it does not matter if one player is more skilled than another.\n\n\n\nOther improvements include a lot more secrets to reveal, more Lego building elements, new (and amusing) melee attacks, the chance to dodge incoming fire, animals to ride and vehicles to pilot, such as X-wings, Snowspeeders and the Millennium Falcon. Vehicle-based stages are now more in keeping with the on-foot action and plenty of ships are available, ensuring young players don\'t get frustrated.\n\n\n\nThe number of secrets to unlock makes the prospect of replaying levels even more appealing, especially with such a large cast. There\'s also a new character-combination feature that lets you mix parts from different characters to make new heroes, such as Han Vader.\n\n\n\nEndgame: A wonderful game that rewards experimentation and co-operation.

Yes, the game lampoons the classic cinematic series but in the process it creates an alternate but independent Star Wars universe based on LEGO models which are based on the original Star Wars characters. This game has single handedly broken two cultural barriers: Star Wars isn’t just for nerds, and LEGO isn’t just for kids.\n\n\n\nAmazingly LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy follows the events of the first three Star Wars movies – in other words, the good ones. Liberties are taken with the plot but that’s all part of the fun. The Story mode does a great job of keeping characters and events in chronological order. All of your favorite Star Wars characters are featured in this game including Luke, Obi, Hans, the Princess, Chewy, R2, C3PO and Darth Vader. If you played the first LEGO Star Wars game you’ll be able to import your favorite characters from that game into this one. Each character has unique powers which will come in handy for different situations. While the gameplay is rather simple, there are tons of unlockables to find which creates its own kind of challenge. You will have to scour the levels from top to bottom to find these goodies which include everything from new characters to new modes. The only way that you can access all of the areas in each level is to exploit the different characters’ abilities.\n\n\n\nGet exclusive PC Game Trainers at Cheat Happens\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nThe Shame of Your Gaming Backlog\n\n\n\nThe Endless Tragedy of Digital Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nIs The Division Afraid to Get Political?\n\n\n\nIs Gaming Addiction a Thing (And Why We Can’t Decide)\n\n\n\nWhy You Might Be a Game Glitch Snob\n\n\n\nHow Gaming Ruins Relationships (And Why It Should Stop)\n\n\n\nWhy Video Game Secrets Matter\n\n\n\nCan Non-Fans Enjoy Sports Games?\n\n\n\nLet\'s Trade Microtransactions for Unlockables\n\n\n\nThis Sequel Will Send You into a RAGE!\n\n\n\nWhere Should Nintendo’s Classics Go Next?\n\n\n\nHow Fortnite Became #1 (and PUBG Didn\'t)\n\n\n\nWhy Deadpool Is F%#king Awesomesauce\n\n\n\nWhy PUBG Is Screwing up Big Time\n\n\n\nHow Video Games Can Get You Arrested\n\n\n\nMore Special Features...\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nLuke and Obi have the Force on their side. With it they can move LEGO objects that would otherwise be immovable. They are also equipped with lightsabers which not only take care of enemies quite nicely but can also be used to foil laser traps which will get them into inaccessible areas. When it comes to ranged combat, Hans Solo and Princess Leia use laser blasters to take out the enemy from a relatively safe distance. They are also equipped with grappling hooks so that they can climb walls and get to higher regions. To get through locked doors you will need the skills of the droids. This is where R2 and C3PO earn their keep. They can hack into computer networks and retrieve access codes to open sealed doors. With his attached rockets, R2D2 has the added ability to propel himself across wide expanses. Being evil has its benefits as well. The dark Sith lord, Darth Vader also has the Force at his command and can also move various LEGO blocks and objects. In fact there are certain ones that can only be moved by those who have joined the dark side. All of these different powers will allow you to seek out hidden treasures located throughout each level. You may just want to tackle the Story mode first and come back for the collectibles later. Regardless of how you pace yourself there is always plenty of things to do in this game.\n\n\n\nAside from the main Story mode, there is a Free Mode which lets you play as any character in any level that you’ve previously unlocked. This is why it may be to your benefit to complete the Story mode first so that you can go back as any character to search for the unlockables. The Super Story mode is a race against time. You have one hour to get through one of the three movie episode levels. You won’t have any time to waste so you’ll just have to push through it. If you manage to accomplish this task you’ll be rewarded with gold bricks which you can use to unlock even more levels. In the bonus rounds you will be able to collect LEGO studs, a million of them to be exact. These studs are used like money. With them you can purchase weapons, power-ups and other goodies.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of interactivity in the game, between characters as well as the environments. Characters can literally be combined using the Character Customizer which will allow you to make your own Star Wars characters out of any of the existing characters’ body parts. How about ChewLeia or Darth3PO? A plethora of objects constructed out of LEGO blocks can be smashed and reassembled into other objects such as stairs or ramps to help you gain access to a hard-to-reach area. In this game, as opposed to the first one, the vehicles that you build such as the Tie Fighters and Star Destroyer can actually be used.\n\n\n\nAnother player can join in anytime and instantly access the Co-op mode. There is always another AI character with you and the player will assume the role of that particular character the instant he or she enters the game. That character can then be relegated back to the AI at anytime and the main player will not be affected at all by the change. This is a well thought-out system that will encourage multi-playing with even the most inexperienced of gamers. It’s unfortunate there isn’t an online mode but considering how much is offered in this title, one can’t really complain much.\n\n\n\nThe production values are good but they aren’t great. There are some camera issues but you do have more control over it than with the first game. There are some framerate hiccups but overall it’s relatively smooth going. The characters look amazing and the stages are filled with detail and depth totally befitting the LEGO/Star Wars universe – which is basically composed of shiny, plastic, material. There aren’t any voiceovers but I hope you weren’t expecting this to be voiced by the original cast. The score is obviously composed by John Williams and even though you’ve heard it before, there’s nothing else that could be more fitting, save perhaps the entire orchestration performed through a shiny, plastic, Casio keyboard.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, LEGO Star Wars II is action, adventure, collecting, puzzles, races, mini-game, Co-op mode and your favorite Star Wars characters all having a great time. All you need is a copy of this game to join in on the fun. Highly recommended for players of all ages.\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n\nRelive the Fun in a Whole New Way!

From the simple building blocks of a house to the multi-colored “planks” of a pirate ship or a square, boxy build of a race car, the only limitation to what you can build is the imagination. So when last year, LucasArts reached into our childhoods with their retelling of Episodes One through Three in LEGO Star Wars. Answering the calls of countless fans, myself included, LucasArts will now retell the original trilogy in LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy.\n\n\n\nStarring the cast of the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II will refine the formula set by its predecessor in providing fun adventure gameplay and combat while remaining fairly accessible to casual gamers. One of the most important adjustments to the “ease” in gameplay will be the adjustable difficulty. If, throughout a level perhaps, you are getting your rear handed to you by various storm troopers and the like, the game will adjust its difficulty down to allow players to continue making progress through the game instead of giving up in frustration. On the other hand, if you are slaughtering everything you come across without so much as a ding, which may have been the case for some players of the original, then the difficulty will ratchet upwards to keep play interesting.\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars allowed players to play as their favorite characters throughout the game and unlock countless goodies, but The Original Trilogy will go one better by allowing players to customize their character with interchangeable parts. That’s right, you can have the head of Princess Leia on the body of Han Solo carrying a light-saber while donning Darth Vader’s black cape. LucasArts will be rewarding owners of the original by using their save files to unlock the original unlockable characters. Including the original characters, over 100 characters will be accessible in The Original Trilogy, including Luke, Lando, Greedo, and every other memorable character imaginable.\n\n\n\nThe customization doesn’t end there either. Like in the original, players will construct different vehicles throughout the game to accomplish goals and clear levels. This time around, however, all non-droid characters will be able to construct vehicles from parts strewn across the stage. These pieces will be found behind obstacles and whatnot, requiring various character skills to access. Additionally, hidden model kit pieces will be hidden in each of the levels throughout the trilogy, allowing you to use custom vehicles, which aren’t found by default in game, through specific stages.\n\n\n\nCharacter specific combat and moves will be expanded upon, making the difference between playing as Han Solo and Chewbacca two completely different gameplay experiences. While Vader may be able to use a Force Choke-Hold to defeat opponents, Chewbacca will be adept at ripping the LEGO arms off of stormtroopers. As stated above, various characters will be able to solve specific puzzles as well. Chewbacca’s brute strength would be useless in a specific stage, for instance, where Luke’s force abilities would be required.\n\n\n\nThese improvements and more, such as bigger level designs and a more competent camera system, will ensure that fans of the original will be more than satisfied by the LEGO telling of Episodes four through six.

It was a curious combination, but it worked because the gameplay was novel enough, the combined nostalgia for Star Wars and Legos was potent, and the experience was delivered with a humorous, lighthearted flair. Lego Star Wars II is an even better package than the original, due almost entirely to the fact that the emotional connection to A New Hope , Empire Strikes Back , and Return of the Jedi is much stronger for most people.\n\n\n\nt works best as a nostalgia piece, but Lego Star Wars II is good fun on its own.\n\n\n\nYou start out in the Mos Eisley Cantina, which serves as a hub from which you can access all three episodes, as well as a counter where you can purchase extras like cheats and additional playable characters, and a new character creation counter. Initially you\'ll have access only to A New Hope, though you\'ll gain access to Empire and Jedi after beating the first chapter. The game hits nearly all of the most memorable sequences from all three films, and it does it all with a goofy sense of humor. Since the game will no doubt attract some hardcore Star Wars fans, it\'s also worth noting that Lego Star Wars II seems to be taking most of its cues from the original theatrical releases. This means you can expect Han to shoot first, Darth Vader to have eyebrows, and Return of the Jedi to end with the classic ""Yub Yub"" Ewok song. They\'re all minor points, but it\'s the kind of stuff that fans will definitely appreciate.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II is still primarily an action adventure game in which you control a group of characters as they blast their way through enemies and do some light puzzle-solving and the occasional platform-jumping. The size of your group expands and contracts regularly, growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times. You control only one character at a time, and you can switch characters easily on the fly. Your artificial intelligence-controlled companions are pretty worthless, save for a few specific scripted sequences. There\'s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters, which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed. Usually, though, the characters you\'re dragging around are there for a reason, as there are several different classes of characters, each with unique abilities that you\'ll need to progress. Jedi characters sport lightsabers, can perform double-jumps, and can use their Force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment. Regular hero characters like Princess Leia and Han Solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot. C3PO and R2D2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment, and R2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances. Short characters like Jawas and Ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n\n\nThese character classes were all in the original, though they\'ve been tweaked slightly. All nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of Legos into usable devices, something that originally only Jedi were capable of; many blaster-wielding characters will now auto-dodge incoming blaster fire; and most characters now have unique melee attacks--it\'s great to watch Chewie rip a stormtrooper\'s arms right out of their sockets or to see Lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were Ryu. Not only do all these refinements make non-Jedi characters more useful, they also lend the game a bit more personality. New to Lego Star Wars II are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters. Since you\'ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode, you\'ll have to rely on special helmet machines, which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter. It\'s a fragile ruse, though, because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off. The bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators, which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original. You\'ll happen upon small carts, landspeeders, and AT-STs that you can pilot in the action adventure chapters, though there are also chapters dedicated to memorable sequences like destroying both of the Death Stars, fighting off imperial forces in your snowspeeder on Hoth, and racing speeder bikes through the forests of Endor. These dedicated vehicle chapters make the game feel more epic and break up the action nicely, but Hoth has been done to death already, and some of the sequences aren\'t as visceral as you might like. This is due largely to a stiff camera, something that occasionally hampers the action adventure levels as well. The camera usually stays in a fixed position, and though you\'re allowed a little wiggle room, there are a few specific points where it\'s easy to get stuck because the path is obscured.\n\n\n\nThere\'s no dedicated multiplayer component to Lego Star Wars II, though it does offer cooperative play, and at any point a second player can just jump right in. It works seamlessly and reduces the number of generally useless AI companions, but it\'s also disappointing that no version of Lego Star Wars II features online co-op. Whether you\'re playing alone or with a friend, Lego Star Wars II is easy. As long as you\'re pointing in the general direction, blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own, and death is barely punished with a small loss of money. It should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around, but there\'s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back.\n\n\n\nOnce you play through a level in the story mode, you can play it again in free play mode, which gives you some control over which characters you\'ll play as, and you\'ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn\'t get to with the story mode characters. You\'ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game, but there are others that you\'ll need to purchase in the shop, and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original Lego Star Wars, if it appeared on the system you\'re playing on. The free play mode also lets you use your own custom-made characters, which you can build using pieces of other playable characters. It doesn\'t effect the gameplay, but there\'s still something really funny about putting Darth Vader\'s head on Princess Leia\'s body when she\'s in her slave costume. Several different types of collectibles, an unlockable series of bounty hunter missions, and time trial mode all help to create some good lasting value.\n\n\n\nThough the game is appearing on no less than eight different platforms, most of these versions are virtually indistinguishable. Featurewise, the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PC versions of Lego Star Wars II are nearly identical, and the PSP version is awfully close, though it takes a slightly different approach to certain unlockables, and it also has much more pronounced loading times. The current-gen console versions all look slightly better than the original Lego Star Wars, while the PC version looks a bit better than those, since it can run at much higher resolutions. By default, the PC version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme, though it’s easily modified. There’s also gamepad support, and we found that a wired Xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons.\n\n\n\nThe character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations.\n\n\n\nThe Xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair, with better reflections, better explosions, and a cool lens-focus effect that makes objects too close to or too far from the camera appear slightly blurry. It\'s definitely the best-looking version, but it\'s also got a very minor frame rate problem that crops up when there are a lot of particle effects. The achievement points in the Xbox 360 version are pretty well balanced. You’ll probably get almost 200 points just by playing through all three episodes, though there is also a string of achievements that require you to complete entire chapters without dying once, which in some cases is no small feat.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the platform, though, the visuals have a ton of charm. Getting to see recognizable Lego pieces mingling with recognizable Star Wars characters and locales is just really endearing, and Lego Star Wars II does it quite well. A vast library of recognizable sound effects and that unshakably rousing John Williams score make the experience feel that much more authentic, and even though there\'s no real voice acting in the game, some miming and appropriate-sounding mumbles make it apparent what\'s going on.\n\n\n\nAs much fun as Lego Star Wars II is, it\'s unfortunate that it had to come second. Some of the novelty of the gameplay, as well as the concept itself, isn\'t quite as potent as it was the first time around. The original Star Wars trilogy just seems more deserving of this nostalgic treatment than the prequels. Still, anyone with even a sliver of nostalgia for Star Wars will find this to be a fun, good-natured romp.\n\n\n\nUpvote\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nView Comments (0)\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\nFun use of both the <i>Star Wars</i> and Lego licenses\n\n\n\nSeamless co-op play\n\n\n\nLonger, more challenging than predecessor\n\n\n\nMore vehicle sequences give better variety\n\n\n\nLoads of unlockable content\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nCamera occasionally obscures the action\n\n\n\nNo online co-op\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\nAbout GameSpot\'s Reviews\n\n\n\nOther Platform Reviews for Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nDS /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nXbox 360 /\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nRyan Davis\n\n\n\nMore GameSpot Reviews\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA 2K19 Review - Another Year, Another Baller\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nShadow Of The Tomb Raider Review - Guerilla Girl\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nValkyria Chronicles 4 Review - Soar High\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA Live 19 Review -- Dribbling Forward\n\n\n\nLoad Comments (0)\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\n\n%gameName%\n\n\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\n\n\n\nYou\'re Good to Go!\n\n\n\nWe\'ll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n\nFirst Released\n\n\n\nSep 12, 2006\n\n\n\nreleased\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance\n\n\n\n+ 8 more\n\n\n\nGameCube\n\n\n\nMacintosh\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPlayStation 2\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy has you controlling LEGO versions of the original Star Wars heroes.\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\nAverage Rating\n\n\n\n10920 Rating(s)\n\n\n\nPlease\n\n\n\nSign In\n\n\n\nto rate\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nDeveloped by:\n\n\n\nAmaze Entertainment\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTraveller\'s Tales\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nRobosoft Technologies\n\n\n\nPublished by:\n\n\n\nLucasArts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nElectronic Arts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFeral Interactive\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTHQ Wireless\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nActivision\n\n\n\nGenre(s):\n\n\n\nAdventure\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nTheme(s):\n\n\n\nSci-Fi\n\n\n\nEveryone 10+ Cartoon Violence, Crude Humor\n\n\n\n© 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

Its gameplay—a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005). While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs – small, disk-shaped objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.



=== Playable characters ===



Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities.  This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the ""Use Old Save"" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data.Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley Cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible. Entering two cheat codes, publicized by IGN, makes pieces for a Santa Claus character available. The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used (for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name ""Darth-3PO""); alternately, the player may create a name.",Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars_II:_The_Original_Trilogy

org / tr / rec - html40 / loose . dtd ""\', \'there’s something to be said for the evergreen appeal of trivia games . chiefly , their charm has always endured in how they can be played by folk of all ages and skill levels . that trivia game , by developer the gameroom , is no different in that regard . able to be enjoyed by both gamers and non - gamers alike , the game’s accessible charms are bolstered by a pick - up - and - play maxim that operates at its core .\', \'a decent but arguably unspectacular recreation of this timeless test of knowledge , that trivia game relies more on the actual trivia itself than attempting to compliment the experience with additional modes or aesthetics .\', \'underscoring the strength of the game’s accessibility , that trivia game allows players to get stuck right into a single or multiplayer trivia session from the offset and with little delay . sadly , those folks looking to test their knowledge against online opponents will find themselves a little disappointed , as multiplayer is available locally only ; its absence a symptom of the game’s impressive , but ultimately narrow focus .\', \'still , should you have the requisite number of friends locally , multiplayer is where that trivia game shines . the tense nature of the questions and the practically non - existent barriers to entry help to make that trivia game a superb party game to bring out for both social and familial occasions , doubly so as the game places a premium on accessibility .\', \'how the developer achieves such accessibility is through a clear and concise user interface that is straightforward and easy to interpret . each player is effectively color - coded by the unique hue of their controller’s light bar , while the answers to the questions themselves map directly and naturally to each of the corresponding face buttons ; making the initiation of non - gamers into that trivia game’s digital fold a pleasingly stress - free exercise .\', \'once you and up to three other friends have chosen your in - game avatars from a motley bunch of larger - than - life archetypes , including the likes of hook - handed pirates and punk rockers , the quiz begins in earnest and is subsequently divided into four distinct rounds .\', \'one round for example , has players betting an amount of their existing points on a single answer while another , is a rapid - fire affair which is guaranteed to raise the intensity in a social setting as players rush to get their answers in first . the whole affair is briskly paced too , with all four rounds able to be finished in around ten minutes , that trivia game fulfils its pick up and play mandate with admirable aplomb .\', \'easily the greatest strength of that trivia game though , is the trivia itself . boasting a variety of questions and topics from movies and music to science , history and much more besides , players will be hard pressed to identify the same question reeled off twice in a short period of time . better yet , the difficulty of these questions is extremely well tuned also ; ensuring that each player is almost guaranteed to get at least a small handful of questions correct during their run .\', \'if the bulk of the developer’s budget and time has gone into its impressive bank of brain - teasing questions , then it’s equally clear to see the trade - offs which have occurred elsewhere .\', \'the most immediate example of where the game appears lesser is in the number of game types and modes , or lack thereof , which are available . as mentioned previously , there are just two modes – single player and multiplayer , but within those modes there exists no diversification outside of the individual rounds and the random nature of the questions themselves .\', \'another tell - tale sign of reined - in ambition is in regard to the game’s aesthetics . framed as a tv quiz show , that trivia game fails to aesthetically impress with its simplistic avatars , basic animation and teeth - grindingly cheesy presenter .\', \'and what a presenter he is ; if only there was a way to mute him . looking like a puppet version of the talk show host from the hunger games movies , his screeching tones and immeasurably condescending attitude will make you want to plug your ears with a variety of kitchen utensils after just a single session .\', \'one other area ,

ready to take it all in one final choice . some games capture this feeling with the finesse of a multi - flavored gummy bear while others have not done so well . that trivia game definitely holds up with some questions and answers that will make some scholars face palm but it definitely has its shortcomings that keep it from being memorable .\', \'that trivia game brings the trivia feel to the

and avatar but they don’t have any impact , at all . the avatars are just a vehicle for the buzzards as they don’t have any differences in speed or otherwise , even when playing alone against an npc . anyone can , literally , pick up a controller and get playing immediately even if they have never heard of a playstation but this is a downfall for those veteran trivia seekers , such as me , who will look for something deeper in this kind of game .\', \'the game , however you start off , either multiplayer or single player , consist of four rounds that play relatively the same with the addition of the final and penultimate rounds . the third round is an elimination round where incorrect answers will disappear , a feature that’s inaccessible to players who may be totally blind or with severe limited vision . it can be very difficult to tell what answer has vanished before a fully sighted competitor . the last round proves even harder for visually impaired people because it consists of flashing answers around random spots of the screen and the contestants have to press x when they see the correct answer flash . as someone who’s visually impaired , i wasn’t able to read the answers by myself so i enlisted readers to tell me the answers that flashed on screen . if a totally blind person is playing alone , however , the game is not accessible . only the questions are read aloud . the answers , nor categories players have to choose at the beginning of rounds , are not read at all . some questions require visually impaired players to identify pictures . thankfully , if a player has some vision , the questions and answers , as well as menus , are very easy to read . if you’re someone who can’t read very fast , such as someone with dyslexia , you’ll need some help reading the answers in order to answer the question before the timer runs out .\', \'people who have physical challenges will be able to play that trivia game without any issues at all because , in the first three rounds , each answer corresponds to a face button . in the final round , you will only have to press x at the exact moment the correct answer flashes on screen .\', \'that trivia game has more

once out of all the games . there isn’t a campaign to unlock anything , and , at the time of this writing , there isn’t any dlc available either , which left little incentive for me to play on my own . when i couldn’t group a gaggle of friends together to bring on the knowledge i didn’t want to play this game a lot . while playing alone i found the npc’s to be really dim witted , even on the simplest questions . there isn’t a way to play online , either , but the developer claims in the playstation blog comments that there could be a future version that will allow for online multiplayer ,

configure , so deaf players are stuck reading the questions and answers . while playing with my deaf friend , and scoring way higher than him , i had to interpret the point changes , and features of all the rounds . if a hard of hearing player were playing alone , they won’t know the subtle differences in the rounds with the exception of the final round which has a radically different play style

encounter . with no motivation to entice players to play on their own , gamers , especially disabled gamers will soon forget this game after the apartment has been cleaned up and everyone goes home . there are trivia games out there that are fully accessible to all disabled players , even the totally blind , such as you don’t know jack . this game doesn’t hold onto the trivia feeling long enough

sprinkles , or even external goodies to make it long lasting . gamers , including disabled gamers , will find other trivia games that provide more education for their dollar , along with an accessible

up was always going to appeal to me on a very deep level . even putting aside the many licensed games that koei works on , the characters of which clearly weren’t available ( so , no arslan or guts from berserk , sadly ) , it’s a testament to the sheer depth of koei’s ip that a roster of close to 30 feels thin . but what is there is delightful , on every level .\', ""warriors all - stars brings together characters from the following franchises : dynasty warriors , samurai warriors , toukiden , dead or alive , deception , atelier , nioh , as well as a couple of incidentals that either haven’t been localised into english ( koei runs some popular dating games in japan for ladies that it hasn’t seen fit to localise yet ) , or are truly obscure now – opoona and nobunyaga make an appearance , for example . as you can probably assume given the links between these franchises are almost non - existent , the plot that has been built into warriors all - stars to explain how they \' re all together is utterly nonsense ; basically they’re all summoned into a fantasy world to help out a fox - faced noble take the throne , and battle others that have the same idea and their own team of heroes ."", \'but , while it’s nonsense , the way that each major battle focuses in on one or two different characters does allow koei to highlight their personalities , and that’s all that’s really important . for characters from franchises who had previously had minimal backstory , this has been an opportunity to get a better sense of them . marie rose and honoka from dead or alive 5 , for example , came as roster additions only after the original release of the initial game , and so had a minimal role in the broader plot as a result . their role in dead or alive xtreme 3 following that was simply to look gorgeous while wearing their bikinis . this is the first time that either character has had a core role in an actual plot , and i quite appreciated that . i also liked the opportunity to get to know some of the characters from koei’s japan - only franchises for the first time . darius from harukanaru toki no naka de , especially , is a character i found immediately interesting . and of the other characters , well , i love most of them , so another opportunity to bop heads with arnice or sophie , while listening to them talk in character , was most welcome indeed .\', \'warriors all - stars , as a love letter to fans of everything koei tecmo , is also quite delightful in the little references that it throws in along the way for the most committed fans . anyone who has played enough atelier games , for example , knows that characters have a weird ( and completely unexplained ) habit of saying “taru ! ” ( barrel ! ) every time they see a barrel . a few years ago i was actually talking to the producer of the series about this and , yes , gust , the developer of the atelier series , is quite aware that people actively look forward to seeing how each character exclaims “taru ! ” when he or she spots a barrel .\', \'so in warriors all - stars , in the main hub between battles , there is , of course , a barrel just sitting there . and every single character has a different way of saying “taru ! ” . nobunyaga says it with such complete disdain , which would sound sinister if it was nobunaga oda , and not a cute cat with nobunaga’s voice . marie rose , meanwhile is so utterly cute about it , and can koei please for the love of god give her the lead in her own game next . most amusing of all , though , is william from nioh . good ol’ bill actually speaks english in a world where all the other characters speak japanese . that’s in keeping with his character from nioh itself . but when he sees a barrel , he breaks out the most ridiculously deadpan “taru , ” complete with his thick irish accent . yes this barrel nonsense sounds like a tiny , little , silly thing , but as a fan of koei stuff and i giggled stupidly as i checked each and every character’s “taru” as i unlocked them .\', \'this is fanservice in the best possible sense . i’m not even going to pretend that this game will appeal to people outside of the koei faithful . it really won’t . those people could pick up any other warriors game and enjoy it far more , because the context will make more sense . you don’t need to care who the characters are in a samurai warriors game , because the action and history itself is the focus . but warriors all - stars is all about the characters . if you don’t know what a laegrinna or arnice is , then you’re just not going to care that they’re there taking down lu bu one moment before having a hotspring adventure with a marie rose the next ( oh yes , i’ve had that dream ) , and then watching a plachta and mitsunari ishida play beach volleyball shortly after . it also won’t matter that after battles you’re winning the same resources that you collect in games like trinity : souls of zill ‘oll or ninja gaiden . it’s just not going to matter to you . but this merging of worlds is delightful for those of us who\', \'spent ungodly amounts of money and time immersing ourselves in koei worlds in the past , and it’s done with such an eye for detail that you really get a rich sense of the kind of company that koei has built into one of the most important japanese developer / publishers out there .\', \'the only companies that even comparable , in terms of the raw value that their franchises hold for fans , is square enix ( which for some reason refuses to do these cross overs ) , and nintendo . warriors all - stars is every bit to koei and its fans what smash bros . is to nintendo .\', \'and that’s why i was surprised at first that the roster actually is slight when compared to other warriors games . to this day i still break out an older , but similar character mash - up in warriors orochi 3 , which had a near endless stream of characters to play with . and i really ,\', \'wanted to team lady sun up with marie rose and meruru when i first hear that warriors all - stars was in development . alas , that was not to be . but that very short moment of disappointment quickly faded , because i realised that in warriors all - stars ever character has a very distinct fighting style , whereas in warriors orochi 3 they generally all behaved similarly . on the higher difficulty settings it’s important to actually understand how each character strings combos together , and then optimise those attack patterns . warriors games are always derided for being “button mashers” but i defy anyone to try to use the same button presses with the heavy , slow william as you’d use for the nimble marie rose , or the range - orientated nobunyaga . it just can’t be done .\', \'there are characters that are what you’d called “overpowered . ” plachta is a demon in battle , for example , and i certainly found the game fundamentally easier with her . but that’s the beauty of the game not having a multiplayer focus – balance between characters doesn’t matter . what’s important is that if you play well and you can get through the game with any character , and i certainly found the challenge of mastering some of the less effective characters enjoyable . what they all share is visually entertaining super attacks and plenty of personality in their quips as the battles progress .\', \'what is slightly more disappointing is the limited character customisation . coming from spirit of sanada , which was nearly a jrpg in how you could develop characters , customisation in warriors all - stars doesn’t extend far past equipping “cards” which are awarded at the end of battles and can upgrade various statistics and abilities of each character . there’s some strategy in how limited these cards can be . there are a lot of different power up options , but only room on a card for a tiny few of them . so you do need to be really strategic about how you merge them together between battles to power them up . but then , that is a system that we’ve seen in plenty of warriors games now , and\', \'is something i’m getting tired of , as a die hard fan of the genre .\', \'what’s more interesting is the way you can take four allies into battle with you . they’ll fight on their own volition for the most part , but you can also call on them to perform super attacks , or alternatively , pair briefly with you to unleash devastating combos on enemies . each character has their own version of support , and mixing and matching an optimal team , and then understanding how to best make use of those abilities is a fun learning curve .\', \'as with all warriors games , the basic enemies are distractions , to the point that you’ll spend most of your time ignoring them altogether . enemy heroes are far tougher and you’ll need to make good use of every resource you’re got available to you to push through them . additionally , battlefields have “bases” that you need to capture by defeating a certain number of enemies so the “commander” appears . knock him out and the base changes to your side . these bases have a variety of effects , but it must be said that they’re minor , and tend to be important locations more because that’s where the missions and boss enemies tend to be than there being any strategic impetus for capturing them . some may find the flow of levels to be overly simple , especially when compared to the likes of arslan or the empires sub - series , but i’m fine with it , since the game’s about the heroes anyway , so koei’s done the right thing in keeping you on the move to these highlights .\', \'warriors all - stars is a gorgeous game . enemies themselves are delightful , having been pulled from the various franchise themselves . bopping the jelly - like punis in the atelier series has always been a delight . now you do it on a mass scale . the cute - yet - sinister toy soldiers from the nights of azure games is another highlight . the levels are also taken from the franchises ; you’ll be battling it out on zach’s beach from dead or alive one moment before invading a castle straight from nioh the next . the level designs are , again , nothing we haven’t already seen in warriors games , but seeing those designed dressed up as fanservice for people who have played the games they’re based on is a thrill .\', \'warriors all - stars is a delight . it’s explicitly a love letter to the koei tecmo faithful , and it doesn’t pretend to be otherwise . does this mean it’s for everyone ? no . not even close . i haven’t played a warriors game that assumes knowledge of the base material from which the game comes from for quite some time . but that was always going to be the case and those fans that this game is designed for will know what they need to . so the real question is whether koei tecmo fans would like a warriors game – koei’s most enduring approach to game design – that pulls beloved characters from almost all of their favourite franchises together ?\', \'the answer to that is : “of course they will . ”\', ""digitally downloaded editor -

stars features a very respectable list of fantastic characters for those , like me , who are fans of koei tecmo titles . a handful of the 30 characters in the game are selectable from the start , with others needing to be unlocked via the main story mode . selecting a character at the start determines what story route you will be going down as you represent one of the three main characters of the story : tamaki , shiki and setsuna .\', \'all three of the stories , however , are essentially the same idea , and the story itself is pretty underwhelming . an ancient spring which has sustained life on earth for years has died , and thus all of these characters from various franchises all get transported to the world together to help and save the earth . most of the main story , however , is just a bunch of nonsense about tamaki , shiki and setsuna arguing over who should be the one to claim the new throne . i doubt there is any kind of canon or continuity with any of these franchises , though . i mean , ayane shouldn \\\' t be calling kasumi "" the cowardly traitor "" anymore . the game does feature multiple endings , most of which are joke endings and a true ending , so there is plenty of reason to replay the story mode multiple times over . while it \\\' s unfortunate that there is only a single game mode—which is story—at the very least , the story mode itself provides a variety of different missions that you can choose from .\', \'aside from the story missions , there are multiple other side missions and quests on the map that you can choose to play in any order . these missions will have objectives such as preventing an ally from being killed , defeating certain officers , or capturing enemy keeps in a certain amount of time . these missions , when completed , will provide your party members with huge amounts of cash and xp . the thing about these missions , however , is that the difficulty of them can be pretty deceiving . i was running a team where all of my members were around level 15 . i decided to do one of the missions where it said the recommended level was only level 6 . i figured i would be fine , until i got into the mission itself where enemies were taking almost no damage at all from my attacks and i was getting leveled by enemies in just a few hits . the map features a "" fog of war "" system , so when you complete a mission the fog around that mission will lift and reveal more missions to complete . the biggest absence in this game , however , is that there is no free mode that just lets you play missions with any unlocked character you want and level them up . while you can easily replay missions in the story mode , it would be nice if there were a mode where we could screw around without worry .\', \'battles in warriors all - stars are exactly what you expect . run around the battlefield , hack and slash hundreds of soldiers , take enemy keeps , eliminate enemy officers . you can bring with you up to four support characters to help you in battle . each character has their own unique support ability which goes on a cooldown after it \\\' s used . some of these abilities include giving back health , buffing your attack damage or your defense , nerfing the enemy , etc . here is a tip : have millennia in your lineup at all times . she has probably the most over powered and helpful support move in the entire game , where she pulls in all enemies close by and lets you unleash a musou attack on all of them . this is incredibly helpful when needing to defeat bosses or officers . the game also features a "" bond "" system . keeping the same characters in your party will increase their bond and can unlock bonuses , including special team attacks , which can be utilized in battle . that said , these bonds are hardly anything more than small banter that occurs between characters , most of which references their time in the games they represent . for instance , if you don \\\' t play dead or alive , you probably won \\\' t know why ayane considers kasumi to be a "" traitor . ""\', \'the coolest new feature of the game is the new "" musou rush . "" during any battle you have the ability to activate musou rush which will instantly cause hundreds of soldiers to spawn around you . you are invincible while also gaining increased attack speed and damage . during musou rush you can slaughter hundreds of soldiers in mere seconds , and killing a certain amount of soldiers will extend the 20 - second time limit of musou rush . at the end , you and your teammates then unleash a nuclear explosion which wipes out anyone and anything around you . then you can stand there and bask in the absolute avalanche of items that you instantly pick up once the rush ends . i think my high score for musou rush was around 1 , 900 kills in 30 seconds .\', ""out of all of the warriors / musou games that i have played , i would put this one right up there with warriors orochi 3 and hyrule warriors as one of my favorites . it \' s still the same hack and slash action you have played many times before , but the small changes keep things fresh . that said , this game is total fan service to those who are long - time fans of the series . while it may attract some people who are fans of characters from the various series , i can \' t exactly think that this is going to make any new players of this long - time series . myself however , i love this game ."", ""it \' s pure fan service , and the story is absolute nonsense , but it \' s the most fun i have had playing an omega force musou game in a long time . fans of this long -

in between oka and darius from haruka : beyond the streams of time be like ? warriors all stars features encounters between characters from all over koei tecmo’s catalogue , showing that a lot of thought went into making connections between all of its characters .', 'many of these encounters translate into fights in the field . players are given a world map and central base to play around with , and that map is populated with dozens of missions for players to take on . many of these will be built around small relationships between the characters , doing rescue missions or fighting battles that draw upon shared stories of building friendships or shared goals .', 'these relationships also grow in other ways . players can get more intimate information about allies by talking to them as they hang around their home base . they can also take a moment to head to their base’s bath house , getting varied private moments between characters based on their levels and other things . those friendships even grow in combat , but more on that in a moment .', 'not all the matches are designed around building up friendships . some will help players build up gold , experience , or cards ( this game’s version of equipment ) , doing so through all - out battles , protecting certain sections of the map , saving allies , returning food stores from bandits , and any other excuse warriors all stars can find to have players bash enemies .', 'expect to clobber soldiers by the hundreds , and warriors all stars offers many ways to keep that entertaining . players will not be fighting alone ; for starters they will be bringing up to five fighters into a single battle . these characters act as ai backup , assisting as players work over basic grunts and more powerful lieutenants .', 'the backup characters have more uses than that , though . players can tap the d - pad in four different directions to force one of their allies to line up alongside them , and can bring all five together into a steamrolling wall of death . players can also separately summon each of these characters for a special attack that will do heavy damage , but they may want to use them sparingly as they have a long cooldown .', 'these allies grow in friendship as players use them , filling a buddy bar that grants players extra buffs as they become better pals with their partners . these fill up quickly—encouraging players to try new allies often—and also provide handy boosts in a hurry .', 'if players are more interested in fighting on their own in warriors all stars , each character offers unique combat abilities that feel like they set them apart . many are the wide , swiping attacks players will need to clear the field , but each character’s execution with their weapon—from giant stone fists and swords to the ball on opoona’s head—looks different enough to keep it fun .', 'players also have access to a special power that cranks their power through the roof ( they are given one use at the start of the match , and another use for every one thousand kills ) . their allies will appear on the sidelines to cheer them on as they use it , and enemies will spawn by the hundreds , allowing players to cleave through them . it’s enough to make players feel like super heroes , and works in a pinch if they are having trouble downing a challenging enemy .', 'warriors all stars isn’t exactly a pushover , so they may need the help . depending on which starting character they choose , players will meet certain allies and go through the story in a set way , but they will also have set enemies from other factions , and when ayane , ryu , and nobunyaga oda all come at once they can easily stomp a careless player . special powers will help here , but players will also want to pay attention to their brave level .', 'brave level is a separate power level that is tied to that stage . this begins at one in every match and increases as players complete side objectives , beat strong allies , or capture territory . if a player isn’t around the same brave level as an enemy character , even if they’re technically high level and decked out , they can get crushed easily . this encourages players to hurry up and complete some extra side objectives rather than gun for bosses , and is a welcome way of getting players to do more in a fight .', 'what isn’t quite as welcome is the card system . cards are equipment in warriors all stars , with characters receiving new cards in fights or through side quests ( which can be picked up at the base ) . however , the game tosses tons of useless low level cards at the player , and while it lets players merge them in hopes of making better cards , these fusions often result in more garbage cards , even when mixing up higher level ones . it feels like a broken system , and beyond a few handy boosts , their power doesn’t feel necessary to finish the game .', 'interesting friendships between varied characters from multiple games , a fun combat system with some welcome additions , and that same soldier stomping fun as previous dynasty games make warriors all stars a solid musou game , and may just be what players need who are nervous about the open world of dynasty warriors 9 .', 'interesting friendships between varied characters from multiple games , a fun combat system with some welcome additions , and that same soldier stomping fun make warriors all stars a solid musou game .']"", '[\'in the early days of dynasty warriors on the playstation 2 , every new release felt like a new experience to be heralded in , no matter if it were a core entry , xtreme legends , or empires . as the series grew long in the tooth , it took omega force trying to expand into other historical time periods or popular franchises to keep the series feeling fresh . as more and more ip’s grew under the warriors umbrella , some marketing executive must’ve had the brilliant idea to mix together a majority of the ips koei tecmo has gotten their hands on . the culmination of twenty years of warriors games is finally here in north america : warriors all - stars for the playstation 4 .\', \'crossover cameos are nothing new for the warriors series , with warriors orochi 3 ultimate most famously dipping into the atelier series , in addition to soul calibur and dead or alive to bill its roster of one hundred - plus soldiers from multiple franchises . sadly , namco properties such as soul calibur haven’t made their return in warriors all - stars , instead focusing on some of koei tecmo’s most famous franchises of recent years , plus a few faces that should feel brand new to american audiences . ryu hayabusa , ayane , and kasumi are instantly recognizable for anyone that’s played a dead or alive title in the past fifteen years , but what about more obscure franchises such as opoona or neuromance ? koei tecmo’s newest ips also get a fair bit of representation , with a handful of characters from both toukiden titles as well as the hero of nioh himself , william .\', \'the bulk of the thirty - member roster are returning heroes from both samurai warriors and dynasty warriors that mark some of the more popular characters in the franchise , yet both ma chao and nobunaga oda seem to have barely missed the cut . the latter exists in another form , namely that of nobunyaga oda of a little known social franchise called samurai cats . i appreciate warriors all - stars building a diverse roster of characters from some of their more obscure franchises such as fatal frame or rygar . to make fans like myself happy , there’s a wide berth of musical selections that feature that signature dynasty warriors heavy metal touch , so if you’ve been aching for some new monster rancher tracks , warriors all - stars has you covered .\', \'warriors all - star’s story centers around a power struggle between three furry siblings , each wielding a mystical weapon and each sharing an equal right to succession to a recently vacated throne . depending on which of the three siblings you choose , the roster will open up with members of that party , though it doesn’t take much time at all to unlock the remaining cast members for the full group . across an ever expanding world map , fights can be chosen at the player’s discretion and feature a wide array of objectives . key missions are tagged with yellow or red crystals and need to be undertaken to advance the story . otherwise , players are free to take on any other mission that pops up , earning additional experience , gold , or cards in the process .\', \'in a properly cryptic fashion , certain yellow key missions need to be taken while others ignored if the player wants to reach the true ending with their chosen patriarch unless they want to finish up the story mode quickly and start anew ( carrying over character levels and other important stats , of course ) . i experienced this myself while working to achieve shiki’s goal , having gained a full roster of characters only to be forced to pick half that number to continue on . unbeknownst to me , i had picked a group at random to work with and had accidentally forgotten to bring along william , the english samurai from nioh that i had put in so much work to leveling up and raising affinities for . because of losing my highest level member , i was forced to spend a longer than usual amount to grind my way back up to fighting form . the story missions i needed to progress were all in the mid - 20’s while my highest member that i opted to bring with was only roughly 10 . it didn’t take too terribly long to get back up to a level that could progress the campaign , perhaps only an hour or two plus a hefty amount of gold to quickly bolster the remaining cast member’s levels .\', \'when you’re heading off to battle in warriors all - stars , you aren’t taking that journey alone . more than the single members of dynasty warriors or the three - person squads of the last warriors orochi title , the diverse cast can work together in five - man teams to achieve their goal . with a lead character that gains all of the experience and perks , four extra party members can join in on the battlefield for additional combos or special attacks . swapping to another character is only a temporary effect , unlike the freely rotating squads from warriors orochi . to offset this , both characters ( or up to all five ) can all attack at once , covering a much wider range of attack and clearing most bases with ease . the more i played around with different squad compositions in warriors all - stars , the more i grew to appreciate this change as it felt all more satisfying to carve up entire groups of enemies at once .\', \'if attacking enemies by the dozens doesn’t satisfy your craving of mass combat , warriors all - stars has a unique rush mode that every character can put to use . for roughly a minute , enemies rush out in greater swarms , numbering in the hundreds that can be cut down in reckless abandon . the higher your kill combo , the more your squadmates will cheer you on , extending the timer and occasionally throwing in an extra attack or two into the fray . with characters that have wide sweeping attacks , such as lu bu , it isn’t uncommon to break the thousand - kill count in a single rush mode . of course , the ai takes a hit and simply stands around as you slaughter their companions in battle , but the warriors series has always offered a sense of gratifying kill counts at the expense of enemies that can properly fight back .\', \'warriors all - stars offers a small variety of mission types that usually range from either having to defend an objective / officer for a set amount of time or go on the offensive and conquer the battlefield instead . one of the more infamous mission types is brought back from hyrule warriors : death battles where both the player and enemy die in a single hit . as these tend to be the fastest way to level a character , it’s worth the challenge , assuming you can survive to the end without getting hit . if possible , take the time to upgrade your player’s card with the resurrection ability , giving them a second chance to finish the mission before seeing that infamous game over screen .\', \'variety and diversity are something that warriors all - stars aims for , but none of it feels quite as in - depth as the other warriors titles . there’s a diverse cast , but only from a small number of franchises . there are character upgrades , but only in the form of equipable cards , not in additional weapons and accessories . and lastly , there are diverse battlegrounds that pull from the represented franchises , but again , you’ll be replaying the same maps over and over throughout the story , although with varying objectives each time .\', \'warriors all - stars does a solid job of trying to bring the musou series back to its roots after so many of omega force’s spinoffs and licensed titles . with a smaller roster than usual , all - stars tries to showcase some of koei tecmo’s popular titles of recent years without giving any of them the attention they so rightly deserve . after enjoying the grand buffet of warriors orochi 3 ultimate’s roster , warriors all -

of’ compilation , pulling characters from all of koei - tecmo’s top franchises ( as well as some less popular ones ) into a story about a world of fox - people in desperate need of heroes to save them from a cataclysmic event just a few days away .\', \'warriors all - stars lets players pick which of three various factions to side with at the start of the game , then lets them fight through a series of branching missions while learning the secrets of the world , recruiting new heroes , and working their way towards one of over a dozen endings . all of the missions follows the traditional musou structure with bases to be captured , heroes to drive off , and treasure to collect .\', \'much of all - stars ‘ charm comes from seeing the faithful translation of familiar characters and locations into an entirely new genre . running around evil mansions from deception or sunny atelier meadows is something i’ve done dozens of times , but seeing them filled with thousands of soldiers thirsty for my blood was a thrilling change of pace . the developers have done an incredible job of making everyone fit into the musou world — while it’s easy to adapt characters who already brawl from ninja gaiden or dead or alive , seeing rpg faces like sophie and platcha , or a pachinko game hostess like rio conjuring spells and kicking ass is a complete surprise in the most delightful way .\', \'the combat is extremely well - built , faster and more accessible than in other musous i’ve played , presumably to make sure it can be easily played by people unfamiliar with the genre and drawn in by the appearance of favorite characters . in addition to the basic light / strong attacks and super moves , players go into the field accompanied by up to four supporting heroes . while they can’t be freely switched between , each of the supports has a special technique that can be triggered at will , as well as the ability to form a line of attackers . using this ability , up to five characters can be onscreen at once , fighting in unison and wiping out hordes of foes with simultaneous combos .\', \'the developers have also done a great job of keeping combat fair even while the player’s characters are monstrously overpowered . this is done via a ‘bravery’ stat that acts as an attack and defense multiplier . defeating enemies , securing camps , and completing side objectives all fill up the bravery meter , which goes from one all the way up to ten . so , while leveling characters is important , it’s not vital in the way battlefield strategy is . players are encouraged to start with skirmishes to build up bravery , fighting low - level captains and heroes until they’re strong enough to take on the field’s bosses . this system gives each individual battle its own unique flow , keeping them from feeling repetitive or stale .\', \'in addition to the story missions , the developers have come up with a half - dozen other types of missions that players can take on to level up their characters and boost relationship stats between teammates . while most of them are basic battles in a variety of settings , there are also a good number of quirky and innovative fights , including ‘rush battles’ where the player has to continuously defeat foes to keep a timer from running out , ‘death matches’ where one hit will kill anything , and team battles which challenge the player to defeat ten heroes in a row , each stronger than the last . all are intriguing spins on the musou format .\', \'while the story isn’t particularly innovative or surprising , it’s well - told with great voice - acting from the characters . more importantly , all - stars is incredibly decent about helping someone find all the endings . at any time players can open up the pause menu and take a look at a roadmap for how to unlock various missions and characters – it starts out covered in question marks , but as more and more entries are filled in , it soon becomes a clearly - delineated path showing the way to anything someone might have missed .\', \'on one level , it’s incredibly satisfying just to see popular characters from various franchises hanging out with one another . especially when the franchises are as incredibly different as these – what could william from\', \'? a lot more than one would think , apparently . beyond the fan -

stars pulls this off . expected battlefield specialists like dynasty warriors’ lu bu and samurai warriors’ yukimura sanada will face off against ninja gaiden’s ryu and dead or alive’s kasumi . as the warriors orochi series also exists , this is not too surprising . then we have characters like nobunyaga oda , from samurai cats teaming up with deception’s laegrinna and things start to get weird . the developers made an intentional decision not to redraw the characters so that they have a unifying art style , giving conversations and battles a jarring lack of cohesion . as these are denizens of other worlds , each with existing fans , it makes sense to maintain the original look of each hero , and frankly , redrawing sophie from the atelier series so that she looks more in line with a musou title would have robbed it of some of the charm .', 'the developers did ensure that the heroes fight like they belong in the same game . my current favorite is deception’s laegrinna . for those unfamiliar with the deception series , it centers around setting chains of traps to send encroaching heroes to embarrassing demises . the “protagonist” is weak in direct combat and must use a malevolent cleverness to punish the righteous . omega force translated this into a warriors character by giving her the ability to throw out a river of traps in front of her , giving her a range that expands the further along the combo string the player goes . laegrinna can also lay stationary traps during her combo string that can be triggered by pressing the strong attack button . it really works , capturing the flavor of the reference source’s gameplay while still feeling like a straight up musou title . this type of attention was paid to all of the oddball characters and the game is much more interesting because of it . the only potential complaint that can be leveled at the character selection is in the fact that it is much smaller than that last major cross over title in the series , warriors orochi 3 .', 'the battles themselves will feel quite familiar to series veterans . throughout the stages , players are given primary and secondary objectives to complete as they work their way across the field , conquering bases that give passive buffs and provide much needed health items . the wrinkle here is in the bravery system . at the start of the stage , the player is at a level one bravery and enemy officers will have their own bravery level attached . through accomplishing side missions and just plain knocking the crud out of the enemy , the player’s bravery level will increase , bolstering their stats . this system is in addition to the already existing character level systems , weapons equipped and use of support characters that join the player in battle . the other fresh introduction comes in the form of the musou rush . clicking the right stick activates this mode , and the player has a limited time to cause as many enemy casualties as possible . the enemies don’t stop coming here . time is added when the player does well enough to cause a supporting character to pop up on the side of the screen and start cheering . in short order , there will be four characters cheering , the player is knocking hundreds of enemies into the air , all to a rainbow colored overlay and peppy music , creating a moment that causes one to wonder what illicit substances the design team was enjoying . it’s bizarrely cool .', 'one new aspect to character improvement comes in the form of the equipable cards . this can be confounding initially as some cards can be fed to other cards , like a free - to - play mobile game . they can also be broken down , sold and enhanced . the easiest way to get around this is just to think of them as weapons . that’s all they are in the end . once the player switches their internal understanding , the collection of these things makes perfect sense . it’s almost as though the developer realized that cards were popular right now and wanted to capitalize on the trend , but didn’t know how to do it .', 'the biggest issue here comes in the form of the lack of multiplayer . these games were made for the cooperative experience . playing final fight solo is a decent time , but playing with a friend is so much better . as these games are the evolution of that style of play , it brings along the same needs . this is a drum that has been beaten before and it’s one that will continue to pop up as long as omega force ignores the best feature of the series since dynasty warriors 3 . for the record , it doesn’t need to be online . we’re just looking for local co - op and are willing to except that the framerate and pop in will go pear shaped when rendering that stuff . we’re used to it and don’t mind .', 'lack of local multiplayer notwithstanding , warriors all - stars is another worthy entry into the musou series . this is one for fans who want to get a little silly with it and ones who have an affinity for other koei tecmo titles . it provides players with a respectable roster of heroes that don’t belong together to go to town , creating a unique experience under a well - known template . it also provides hours of gameplay , with branching paths and multiple heroes to use . most importantly , it is rife with opportunities to inspire the rule 34 crowd . they come aboard and the franchise is set for life .', '© 2018 hardcore gamer llc . all rights reserved .']"", '[""you \' ve come this far . . ."", \'one of last year \\\' s more pleasant surprises was undoubtedly lego star wars , the tt games - developed ode to george lucas \\\' incredibly popular sci - fi universe . with its unique art style , "" pick up and play "" mechanics , and the best use of a popular license that we \\\' d seen in a long , long time , it literally came out of nowhere to win critics and consumers over with its charming mix of action and humor . with a resume like that and three movies that could still be "" legofied "" remaining , a sequel was inevitable .\', \'eighteen months later we have it ( and for the first time , on psp ) . like the empire strikes back which inspired it , lego star wars ii : the original trilogy improves on its predecessor in just about every way . its stage design , source material , musical score , visual presentation , and jokes are all of a higher quality than they were before . there are even a number of additions that are new for the series altogether and extra mini - games thrown in just for the heck of it . in other words , the original trilogy is almost the perfect sequel .\', ""explaining how lego star wars works is actually quite simple . the main gameplay mechanics are essentially the same one - dimensional bits that make up most actioners out there ( with an attack , jump , and special button available ) . using basic strikes and defensive skills , players will regularly chop or blast their way through an unending army of stormtroopers , sand people , and bounty hunters while fighting the occasional boss or mid - boss every couple of levels . but that \' s where it \' s similarities to other titles ends ."", ""what makes lego star wars truly unique is that players will be in control of at least two characters at a time , and sometimes as many as six . with a quick tap of the button , gamers can hop back and forth between anybody in their party - - be they jedi , rebel , droid , or whatever - - and each of these archetypes play entirely different . so while luke skywalker and obi - wan kenobi may be ideal for taking out large groups thanks to their jumping lightsaber attacks , only droids can access certain areas that allow you entry to the next section . moreover , the standard blaster characters can mean the difference between life and death when fighting enemies from a distance and traveller \' s tales has done an excellent job of balancing things so that you \' ll have to rely on all these styles to succeed ."", ""this combination of straightforward mechanics and a clever use of strategy is what makes lego star wars so fun to play . but character selection for battles and the occasional door access isn \' t all there is to it . part of the game \' s brilliance is how it mixes puzzles with combat and how it makes use of the lego license by allowing players to build or destroy structures . fans of the first game are no doubt familiar with this system , but lego star wars ii has added a few new goodies to make the puzzles that much more elaborate and the pace that much faster . the fact that any non - droid character can now build items instead of just a jedi , for example , encourages the use of non - force personalities more than before . multi - screen puzzles with a couple of multi - solution outcomes are also welcome additions , while the inclusion of about a billion secrets is a good thing too ."", \'if multiplayer is your thing , then lego star wars has that also . just like last year \\\' s title , the original trilogy allows for immediate "" drop in / drop out "" two - player co - op at any time ( via ad hoc ) with a few small tweaks thrown in for good measure . take the camera , for instance . now it draws back much further than it use to before requiring characters to move closer to one another . there \\\' s an all - new ( and extensive ) character creation feature built - in as well , and it allows users of vastly different play styles and preferences to hook up however they want . sadly , infrastructure co - op isn \\\' t supported in lsw2 , and even if you \\\' re playing via wi -

stars is the latest one - versus - thousand action title bringing together many of koei tecmo games’ most beloved characters for an all - new warriors style experience .\', \'koei tecmo already has a crossover title with the warriors orochi series . for fans of both samurai warriors and dynasty warriors , the crossover was a big deal since they finally saw fan favorite characters interact . the company itself has enough characters and franchises that are ripe for the proven musou formula , and what better way to put them all together than in one big crossover title , warriors all - stars ?\', ""the story is somewhat expected for a big crossover title like this . a faraway world is on the brink of dying due to a spring that has stopped providing its life - giving water . the widowed queen , who \' s also a priestess of the world , foretold that only heroes from other worlds would be able to save them from doom . the heroes were summoned , but the spell wasn \' t strong enough to have them gather in one place , and they were scattered all over the kingdom . the queen \' s two children and her nephew went their separate ways to gather these heroes to save the world — while attempting to win the throne for themselves ."", ""the generic story is an excuse for the characters of the various franchises to be in the same world at the same time , and it doesn \' t get better as you progress . the three characters fall into the expected anime tropes and aren \' t interesting in their own right . even if you \' re not familiar enough with the characters , their interactions in the cut scenes are often amusing enough to play through the game multiple times in order to see them all . the only drawback is that some of the more interesting dialogue pieces come in the middle of a fight , so you \' ll often be too busy to appreciate what \' s being said ."", ""there are roughly 30 playable characters throughout the entire game , and while that roster count may seem small to musou fans , the breadth of the game library more than makes up for that . musou fans will appreciate the appearance of fan favorites like lu bu and yukimura sanada , but those familiar with the company \' s popular and obscure games will also see their favorites represented . given the popularity of ninja gaiden and dead or alive , it shouldn \' t be surprising to see ryu hayabusa , kasumi and marie rose . fans of the atelier games will appreciate seeing plachta and sophie neuenmuller , and characters from both toukiden and deception also make appearances . even william from this year \' s big hit nioh is present , but the more interesting characters are from obscure titles such as rio from the pachinko game of the same name , opoona from the very obscure wii title , and nobunyaga oda from samurai cats , an old trading card game from the early days of the android ."", ""for the most part , the fighting mechanics follow the basics of the musou formula rather closely . you have the basic and strong attacks , which can be chained together to create some good combos . hit enough enemies to build your super meter , and you can unleash a super move to take out more enemies at a time or deal hefty damage to a boss or captain of the outpost . leveling is also back , so you can increase your stats automatically and learn some new combos for your character . mounts are not here , however , so you \' ll have to run to all of your battles instead of relying on a horse or similar creature ."", ""following that musou formula also means that the game comes with those same criticisms that are so ingrained in the series that fans accept them as part of the charm . enemies still use their time - honored tactic of crowding around you and waiting to be hit . the battlefields are more like labyrinths with their winding corridors and pathways , and while there \' s always one central objective , so many ancillary ones pop up during a battle that you \' ll likely run around the battlefield exploring every nook and cranny . outposts litter the field , and while some have bonuses like refilling your health , they all require killing a set number of people before you have an opportunity to take over ."", ""the crossover theme isn \' t limited to the characters . while the layout of some stages is the same as some of the levels in earlier titles , they take on the themes of the other games , whether it \' s a full - fledged casino or an interpretation of a medieval european town . the enemies also take on the themes , so while you may usually fight anthropomorphic canines , you \' ll also run into smiling slime creatures and feudal japanese soldiers . the creature and environment themes often clash , so there \' s more crossover to be had at every turn ."", ""one of the newer additions to the fighting mechanics is the bravery system . much like a moba , bravery is a separate sort of level that \' s contained in each battlefield . it climbs at a much higher pace than your regular xp and is gained more swiftly once you accomplish various side tasks , such as killing a number of soldiers under five minutes . that bravery system acts as a gateway for how far you can go in a battle , since enemies with higher bravery aren \' t damaged much by your attacks . the mechanic is interesting on paper , but it feels like an artificial way of extending the game since players were never gated like this in the past ."", \'unlike the last time that koei tecmo shoehorned a few dead or alive cameos into warriors orochi 3 , the inclusion of these characters means that they all have attacks of their own . ayane and honoka go in without weapons . sophie summons large bombs and creatures from the sky and administers electric shocks . laegrinna implements traps for her attacks , so her character is faithful to her deception roots . rio has the more oddball attacks , as she uses giant dice , poker chips , a roulette wheel and slot machines for attacks . the fighters feel very different this time around , giving players a reason to change characters to see those variations .\', ""though most of the elements will be familiar , there are a few new things thrown in for good measure . you now have the ability to take four additional characters into battle . they \' ll automatically follow you and attack on their own or become part of your combo chain . you can also summon them for special abilities , like health refills or to dispel curses placed on you . they can also be called upon to link up with you , so you can take control of all of them simultaneously for a limited time . one of the more interesting abilities in your arsenal is musou rush . given to you at the beginning of each battle and earned once more for every 1 , 000 kills , musou rush puts you in a frenzied state where , for 20 seconds , an endless supply of enemies surround you and you \' re free to kill as many as you can . your allies appear on - screen to cheer you on , and reaching certain milestones extends your time in this mode . once the timer expires , you unleash a final screen - clearing attack and gain a ton of items ."", ""outside of combat , the game has seen some other changes . much like the recent samurai warriors : spirit of sanada , the game has a central hub town , where you can talk to people for fun or see the crossover characters do things , like play with slot machines and arcades or play volleyball . useful activities in the hub town include getting special missions in exchange for items that can be used to augment character cards . those character cards , which are gained in battle , can power up characters with abilities like extra fire damage , resistance to certain curses , or blocking rear attacks . cards can also be sold for cash or crafted into newer cards , so copies of the same character card don \' t go to waste . the town also features a sparring area where players can grind for xp without starting a full - blown mission . finally , the affinity system means that you gain abilities when you have someone else in your party , as long as you keep partnering with them over time ."", ""the mission structure , however , is completely new . finish the first training mission , and you \' ll be introduced to a huge world map that functions similarly to a map in a rts game . new areas are opened up once you complete a mission that \' s next to a darkened zone . from here , you can access the next story - based mission , but that are surrounded by several side missions , which include tasks like raiding bases , protecting bases and gaining new characters for your party . there are even missions that \' ll only appear for a short period of time , and you \' ll receive big bonuses for finishing them . the missions are enough to keep you busy and lengthen each character \' s game , so even though the roster may be smaller than usual , the overall game length for completionists is on par with those older titles ."", \'sadly , warriors all - stars is very sparse when it comes to modes . story mode is the only actual game mode here with the rest of the game being taken up by galleries and encyclopedias for every character here . with things like co - op and free roam gone , the game can feel rather lacking for those well versed in past entries .\', ""the audio is all over the place , but in a good way . the game maintains the series \' use of japanese - only audio , which makes for great voice work at the expense of being able to follow the story during battle sequences . the sound effects are solid , but the music is the real treat . since this is a crossover title , you \' ll get some familiar songs from every represented series , but they come in two flavors : the original and a newer version that \' s done in the series \' famous guitar rock style . it \' s a nice touch that fans will appreciate ."", ""graphically , warriors all - stars brings back memories of the series during the ps3 era . the environments are fine but don \' t display much flourish , even when the themes are different from what the series has seen before . the characters are a bright spot , as they retain the same appearance from their original games . seeing hajime arima from haruka : beyond the stream of time show up in complete cel - shaded form may contrast with the 3 - d environments , but it looks better than having that character \' s appearance become mangled in full polygonal 3 - d . the frame rate is a letdown , as we \' re back to a sub - 30 fps after finally cracking a more consistent 60 fps . it \' s baffling since there isn \' t a massive increase in simultaneous fighters on - screen and the special effects have been pared back ."", ""your reaction to warriors all - stars will depend on how big of a musou fan you are . if you \' re a hardcore fan of the series and have played through many of the main entries and a number of the side titles , then you may be fine with renting this one or getting it when it \' s cheaper . the crossover appeal and the new mechanics are very nice , but the lack of modes can make this feel incomplete . if you \' re a more casual fan or new to the series , this is much easier to recommend , as it \' s a good introduction to past games and prepares you for the changes in the upcoming ninth game in the main series ."", \'capcom cancels several development projects at vancouver . . .\', ""\' kingdom hearts iii \' ( all ) introduces big hero 6 world -

offs from legend of zelda to one piece , and think the tried and true beat - em - up / hack - and - slash formula has some life left in it . to commemorate a whole slew of games , koei - tecmo released warriors all - stars , a crisis crossover event featuring characters from different titles of the company . with a cast of thirty characters , does it have what it takes to become the pinnacle of the franchise ?\', \'with more than a dozen series represented in warriors all - stars , it’s only natural that an original storyline would hastily connect them together : in a kingdom far away , a magical spring is starting to wither . princess tamaki summons heroes from all over time and space , but an unfortunate accident causes them to become separated . due to this , characters will join forces with either tamaki , older brother shiki , or cousin setsuna to try and save the kingdom from destruction , with the ulterior motive to claim the throne as their own . the campaign that you enter depends on which one of the initial playable heroes you select . the initial storyline , while slightly generic and underwhelming at times , is serviceable enough to get engaged , and near the end becomes more intriguing .\', \'now , the main draw here is the character roster . while warriors orochi tackles a crossover between the dynasty warriors and samurai warriors franchises , warriors all - stars is more of a celebration of different series in general . while you have your usual dynasty warriors and samurai warriors representatives ( including a new addition to the upcoming dynasty warriors 9 , zhou cang ) , you’ve got other characters from popular games like ninja gaiden and nioh to obscure titles that haven’t seen the light of day here in north america ( rio is a representative of… rio , a gambling game that was japan - exclusive ) . it’s an eclectic cast that really highlights the diverse gameplay of koei - tecmo , and it really shows since many of them play distinctly from one another ; ryu hayabusa can zip through enemies quickly , while rio employs a bevy of casino related items in the fray . while you do get a good portion of selectable characters to start out with , you’ll have to unlock the others during a playthrough , and that’s where the meat of the game lies .\', \'the first couple of stages ( where you’re dropped into a scenario based on which character you picked first ) , will acclimate the basic game flow of most of the game : you have different bases you can liberate from the enemy , highlighted as blue ( yours ) and red / yellow ( other opponents ) . after beating enough enemies , you’ll take the base for yourself and be granted with whatever bonus that base acquired , ranging from health pickups to random equipment . aside from that , you have sub and main missions , the latter of which you’re required to fulfill in order to win the stage .\', \'while a one man army initially , you can recruit up to four more characters in order to fight alongside you as bodyguards . with the tap of a button , you can either summon them for a brief support attack or momentarily control them before you have to reset a cooldown gauge to use them again . these also tie into a bravery system ; the more enemies you kill in a stage , the higher your bravery increases . this can lead to more devastating support attacks , which help out in the long run . it was cool seeing weaker party members become wrecking balls midway into a stage , and i love that feeling of destroying your enemies when they have the upper hand . additionally , forming a party with different members will unlock different regard towards you , which will increase the more you interact with them . this can grant you bonuses like gallery unlocks to hero cards ( which acts as warriors all - stars’ weapon equipment ) , and it’s worth switching your party around to level up each person’s regard meter .\', \'other than your basic attacks ( which you can chain together for combos ) , you have your devastating musou attacks ( which can be unleashed once you give or receive enough damage ) , and a star rush , which will randomly place literally thousands of mooks in your line of sight so you can mow them down like the sunday lawn . while this last attack is admittedly entertaining to watch the first few times , after an hour of playtime , it just becomes repetitive and tedious . it was a cool addition at first , but ends up being a bit distracting .\', \'after these stages , you will open a world map and different activities will appear on the screen . these activities can range from ally garrisons ( where you protect a base from enemies ) , to monster battles ( where it’s basically a regular stage , except with monsters ! ) . like the star rush attacks , they’re a cool addition at first , but they end up becoming repetitive filler the longer you play , which is a shame because the rest of the game is pretty solid .\', \'aside from the generic missions you can encounter during gameplay , a number of key battles and hero battles will also unlock as you level up . while the former advances the main plot , the latter influences your current party : by choosing to fight different battles at different times , and even having a certain character in your party , you can recruit more heroes into your roster . in between stages , you can also rest at a central hub , where you can accept missions from heroes as well as hang out with them in the spa . these small interactions highlight the eclectic nature of the cast , and it’s always funny seeing william from nioh fail at an arcade game .\', \'because of how factions work , around half the cast is unavailable for most of a given playthrough ( save the true ending ) , so it’s a game that encourages different branching playthroughs , and will reward different endings based on criteria met . with so much to do , it’s actually a pretty neat idea to increase the replay value of the game . i just wished the padding of the generic stages wasn’t so prevalent .\', \'with so much to unlock and experience , it’s interesting to see which endings you can unlock ; these are also key battles that appear after meeting certain criteria . however , one of the biggest flaws with this game is that it’s single - player only . while 30 characters is admittedly small for a warriors title , the fact that the cast plays very differently means that it would’ve been suitable for couch co - op , a staple in almost every warriors game to date . the exclusion of it is jarring , and i really wanted to play this with a friend . it’s not like the ps4 can’t handle it , either . the lack of multiplayer is by no means a deal breaker , but the omission will be felt for those that want a co - op warriors game . it would’ve been cool to see some enemies from different series pop up as well , not just a select assortment of monsters ; as it stands , beating anthropomorphic troops is unique to the game , but it could’ve been cool to fight some npcs from dead or alive or the atelier games .\', \'while warriors all -

solving and the occasional platform - jumping . the size of your group expands and contracts regularly , growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times . you control only one character at a time , and you can switch characters easily on the fly . your artificial intelligence - controlled companions are pretty worthless , save for a few specific scripted sequences . there \' s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters , which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed . usually , though , the characters you \' re dragging around are there for a reason , as there are several different classes of characters , each with unique abilities that you \' ll need to progress . jedi characters sport lightsabers , can perform double - jumps , and can use their force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment . regular hero characters like princess leia and han solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot . c3po and r2d2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment , and r2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances . short characters like jawas and ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas ."", ""these character classes were all in the original , though they \' ve been tweaked slightly . all nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of legos into usable devices , something that originally only jedi were capable of ; many blaster - wielding characters will now auto - dodge incoming blaster fire ; and most characters now have unique melee attacks - - it \' s great to watch chewie rip a stormtrooper \' s arms right out of their sockets or to see lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were ryu . not only do all these refinements make non - jedi characters more useful , they also lend the game a bit more personality . new to lego star wars ii are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters . since you \' ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode , you \' ll have to rely on special helmet machines , which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter . it \' s a fragile ruse , though , because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off . the bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators , which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects ."", ""lego star wars ii puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original . you \' ll happen upon small carts , landspeeders , and at -

op . whether you \' re playing alone or with a friend , lego star wars ii is easy . as long as you \' re pointing in the general direction , blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own , and death is barely punished with a small loss of money . it should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around , but there \' s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back ."", ""once you play through a level in the story mode , you can play it again in free play mode , which gives you some control over which characters you \' ll play as , and you \' ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn \' t get to with the story mode characters . you \' ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game , but there are others that you \' ll need to purchase in the shop , and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original lego star wars , if it appeared on the system you \' re playing on . the free play mode also lets you use your own custom -

gen console versions all look slightly better than the original lego star wars , while the pc version looks a bit better than those , since it can run at much higher resolutions . by default , the pc version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme , though it’s easily modified . there’s also gamepad support , and we found that a wired xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons .\', \'the character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations .\', ""the xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair , with better reflections , better explosions , and a cool lens -

person perspective , and takes place in a 3d game world that contains objects , environments and characters designed to resemble lego pieces . its gameplay—a combination of the action - adventure , platform , and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of lego star wars : the video game ( 2005 ) . while lego star wars followed the events of the phantom menace ( 1999 ) , attack of the clones ( 2002 ) , and revenge of the sith ( 2005 ) , lego star wars ii is based on star wars ( 1977 ) , the empire strikes back ( 1980 ) , and return of the jedi ( 1983 ) . the game comically retells the trilogy ' s events using cutscenes without dialogue . the player assumes the roles of the films ' characters , each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities . at any time , a second player can join the game , by activating a second controller . during gameplay , players can collect lego studs – small , disk - shaped objects , that serve as the game ' s currency . the player has a health meter , which is displayed on the game ' s heads - up display . the player ' s health is represented by four hearts ; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away . however , they instantly respawn and can often re - collect the lost studs . the game ' s central location is the mos eisley cantina , a spaceport bar on the planet tatooine . at the counter , the player may use their lego studs to purchase characters , vehicles , gameplay hints and extras , or activate cheat codes . in a small area outside the cantina , players may view collected vehicles . the game is broken into levels , which are accessed from the cantina ; each film is represented by six levels , representing key locations and scenes in that film . the locations include hoth , bespin , dagobah , tatooine , the death star , and endor . the game also features bonus levels . during levels , the player defeats enemies , builds objects out of lego bricks and drives vehicles , certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles , including a tie fighter , a snowspeeder , and the millennium falcon . levels must first be played in story mode . this unlocks the next level as well as a free play mode for the recently completed level . gameplay is identical in the two modes . however , story mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on , while free play offers all those unlocked . levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items . three types of secret items are available : gold bricks , minikits , and power bricks . within each level is hidden one power brick . when a power brick is collected , its corresponding extra , such as invincibility or stud multipliers , becomes available for purchase . each level also contains ten hidden minikits , that is , ten pieces of a star wars vehicle . when all ten have been collected , the player is awarded a gold brick . collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards , such as a spigot that spews out studs . gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed , and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level ; ninety - nine gold bricks are available . the vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina . as each vehicle is completed ( all ten minikits collected ) , it becomes available for play in a bonus level .

Chiefly, their charm has always endured in how they can be played by folk of all ages and skill levels. That Trivia Game, by developer The Gameroom, is no different in that regard. Able to be enjoyed by both gamers and non-gamers alike, the game’s accessible charms are bolstered by a pick-up-and-play maxim that operates at its core.\n\n\n\nA decent but arguably unspectacular recreation of this timeless test of knowledge, That Trivia Game relies more on the actual trivia itself than attempting to compliment the experience with additional modes or aesthetics.\n\n\n\nUnderscoring the strength of the game’s accessibility, That Trivia Game allows players to get stuck right into a single or multiplayer trivia session from the offset and with little delay. Sadly, those folks looking to test their knowledge against online opponents will find themselves a little disappointed, as multiplayer is available locally only; its absence a symptom of the game’s impressive, but ultimately narrow focus.\n\n\n\nStill, should you have the requisite number of friends locally, multiplayer is where That Trivia Game shines. The tense nature of the questions and the practically non-existent barriers to entry help to make That Trivia Game a superb party game to bring out for both social and familial occasions, doubly so as the game places a premium on accessibility.\n\n\n\nHow the developer achieves such accessibility is through a clear and concise user interface that is straightforward and easy to interpret. Each player is effectively color-coded by the unique hue of their controller’s Light Bar, while the answers to the questions themselves map directly and naturally to each of the corresponding face buttons; making the initiation of non-gamers into That Trivia Game’s digital fold a pleasingly stress-free exercise.\n\n\n\nOnce you and up to three other friends have chosen your in-game avatars from a motley bunch of larger-than-life archetypes, including the likes of hook-handed pirates and punk rockers, the quiz begins in earnest and is subsequently divided into four distinct rounds.\n\n\n\nOne round for example, has players betting an amount of their existing points on a single answer while another, is a rapid-fire affair which is guaranteed to raise the intensity in a social setting as players rush to get their answers in first. The whole affair is briskly paced too, with all four rounds able to be finished in around ten minutes, That Trivia Game fulfils its pick up and play mandate with admirable aplomb.\n\n\n\nEasily the greatest strength of That Trivia Game though, is the trivia itself. Boasting a variety of questions and topics from movies and music to science, history and much more besides, players will be hard pressed to identify the same question reeled off twice in a short period of time. Better yet, the difficulty of these questions is extremely well tuned also; ensuring that each player is almost guaranteed to get at least a small handful of questions correct during their run.\n\n\n\nIf the bulk of the developer’s budget and time has gone into its impressive bank of brain-teasing questions, then it’s equally clear to see the trade-offs which have occurred elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe most immediate example of where the game appears lesser is in the number of game types and modes, or lack thereof, which are available. As mentioned previously, there are just two modes – single player and multiplayer, but within those modes there exists no diversification outside of the individual rounds and the random nature of the questions themselves.\n\n\n\nAnother tell-tale sign of reined-in ambition is in regard to the game’s aesthetics. Framed as a TV quiz show, That Trivia Game fails to aesthetically impress with its simplistic avatars, basic animation and teeth-grindingly cheesy presenter.\n\n\n\nAnd what a presenter he is; if only there was a way to mute him. Looking like a puppet version of the talk show host from The Hunger Games movies, his screeching tones and immeasurably condescending attitude will make you want to plug your ears with a variety of kitchen utensils after just a single session.\n\n\n\nOne other area, though, where the game fares well is in Remote Play. A perfect candidate for the functionality, That Trivia Game plays effortlessly on PlayStation Vita and is perfect for players looking to get some much-needed practice away from the confines of their living rooms.\n\n\n\nEvocative of the Buzz! games that preceded it on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, That Trivia Game aims to fill a part of the PlayStation 4’s portfolio that has been criminally underserviced up until this point, albeit with far less flair than its last-gen predecessors.\n\n\n\nSure enough while the game might be lacking in features and overall polish, the developers of That Trivia Game have focused on what really counts – the trivia and that proves to be a well-judged design decision. As such, That Trivia Game stands as a decent, fun and accessible take on trivia that can be enjoyed by all ages.\n\n\n\nScore\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nThe Final Word\n\n\n\nA fine recreation of trivia with a real focus on the questions, That Trivia Game is best enjoyed with friends as its limited additional content and modes will struggle to sustain the interest of a lone player.\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\nhtml PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd""\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 Screenshots Released\n\n\n\nadmin / September 17, 2018\n\n\n\nA mass of stunning new Red Dead Redemption 2 screenshots have been revealed, and some of them will make some …\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\nhtml PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd""\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nPSN Store Update: New PS4 Games For September 18, 2018\n\n\n\nMargret Fermin / September 17, 2018\n\n\n\nThe new PlayStation PSN store update brings in loads of new PS4 games.

They are penalized with 1500 points if they choose the wrong answer and awarded one thousand for a correct guess.\n\n\n\nBecause the penalty for a bad reaction is so big, the round can turn the entire game on its head, but the structure also makes it very tense and tends to create the kind of experience that I was referring to at the start of the review.\n\n\n\nWith a full complement of four gamers, That Trivia Game can become even more interesting, and curses, victory shouts and more could often be heard around the room, to the extent that some of those involved actively failed to pay attention to the questions at times.\n\n\n\nThe title also has a solid list of categories and questions, and in almost 12 sessions, we only had a few of them repeated; fortunately, some of the more obscure ones where I had already forgotten the answers that had been revealed before.\n\n\n\nOne critique that can be made is that That Trivia Game is a little too focused on North America, especially when it comes to categories linked to geography and politics, which can be a problem for gamers who are not familiar with things like baseball and TV dinner inventors.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the enjoyable core gameplay of That Trivia Game is undermined by the rather limited quality of the graphics, which cannot be excused given that the game is offered on the very powerful PlayStation 4.\n\n\n\nThe presenter and the avatars of the players are jaggy and weird looking, and there’s no attempt to make either the set or the crowds watching the show interesting or part of the contest.\n\n\n\nThere’s little variation when it comes to the style between rounds and the title would have benefited greatly from a little more color here and there.\n\n\n\nIt’s also hard to understand why the development team chose to drop online multiplayer and only offers options for local play, given that trivia is the kind of experience where meeting strangers and challenging them to contests of intelligence and knowledge is a great idea.\n\n\n\nI enjoy playing with friends, but I am sure that, unless I carefully manage groups and rotations, we will get bored of each other and will abandon a game that could have had a much bigger replayability factor if it had simply used the PlayStation Network.\n\n\n\nThat Trivia Game shows that not all titles launched on the PlayStation 4 need to be high-profile shooters or quirky indies, and that there’s a niche for classic game experiences that can benefit from the automation that a home console can offer.\n\n\n\nThe core mechanics of the game are pretty solid, but unfortunately That Trivia Game lacks the presentation and the multiplayer required to be enjoyable in the long term.\n\n\n\nWe have two other EU keys for That Trivia Game to give out, so please leave a comment about the title below with a valid e-mail adress to get one.\n\n\n\nstory\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\ngameplay\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nconcept\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\ngraphics\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\naudio\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nmultiplayer\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nfinal rating\n\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n\nEditor's review\n\n\n\nfair\n\n\n\nNEXT REVIEW: Sniper Elite 3\n\n\n\nFresh Reviews\n\n\n\nLarger battery, more storage, improved cameras\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9 Review - Agent 007 [UPDATED]\n\n\n\nA darker and clumsier take on some of King Arthur's myths\n\n\n\nSword Legacy: Omen Review (PC)\n\n\n\nSamsung’s latest iPad killer is finally here\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S4 Review - Happy Medium\n\n\n\nA well-balanced expansion that's exceptionally fun to play\n\n\n\nHearthstone – The Boomsday Project Review (PC)\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nUpdate bringing IE improvements on older Windows\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Launches Windows 7 Cumulative Update KB4463376\n\n\n\nNew build with no known issues pushed to the Fast ring\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Releases Windows 10 October 2018 Update Build 17760\n\n\n\nThe game will include all of the content released so far\n\n\n\nDiablo III Eternal Collection to Arrive on Nintendo Switch in November\n\n\n\nHundreds of thousands of computers still vulnerable\n\n\n\nPersistent EternalBlue-Powered Wannamine Cryptominer Still Alive\n\n\n\nGrant to offer instruction, training, and certifications\n\n\n\nUS Rep.

Two friends in a match in a trivia game and it is all down to one question. Fingers hover over the buttons, ready to settle the winning score in a blitz of wits. The announcer utters the final question. Fingers twitch. The game is almost over and all players are sweating rivers ready to take it all in one final choice. Some games capture this feeling with the finesse of a multi-flavored gummy bear while others have not done so well. That Trivia Game definitely holds up with some questions and answers that will make some scholars face palm but it definitely has its shortcomings that keep it from being memorable.\n\n\n\nThat Trivia Game brings the trivia feel to the PS4 , allowing for gamers and non-gamers alike to easily pick up and play with no problem at all. The setup is really simple and offers an environment to just get started, even if you are not a gamer. The main menu offers two main options, single player, and multiplayer that holds up to four local slots. There aren’t any options to customize except for people selecting their buzzer sound and avatar but they don’t have any impact, at all. The avatars are just a vehicle for the buzzards as they don’t have any differences in speed or otherwise, even when playing alone against an NPC. Anyone can, literally, pick up a controller and get playing immediately even if they have never heard of a PlayStation but this is a downfall for those veteran trivia seekers, such as me, who will look for something deeper in this kind of game.\n\n\n\nThe game, however you start off, either multiplayer or single player, consist of four rounds that play relatively the same with the addition of the final and penultimate rounds. The third round is an elimination round where incorrect answers will disappear, a feature that’s inaccessible to players who may be totally blind or with severe limited vision. It can be very difficult to tell what answer has vanished before a fully sighted competitor. The last round proves even harder for visually impaired people because it consists of flashing answers around random spots of the screen and the contestants have to press X when they see the correct answer flash. As someone who’s visually impaired, I wasn’t able to read the answers by myself so I enlisted readers to tell me the answers that flashed on screen. If a totally blind person is playing alone, however, the game is not accessible. Only the questions are read aloud. The answers, nor categories players have to choose at the beginning of rounds, are not read at all. Some questions require visually impaired players to identify pictures. Thankfully, if a player has some vision, the questions and answers, as well as menus, are very easy to read. If you’re someone who can’t read very fast, such as someone with dyslexia, you’ll need some help reading the answers in order to answer the question before the timer runs out.\n\n\n\nPeople who have physical challenges will be able to play That Trivia Game without any issues at all because, in the first three rounds, each answer corresponds to a face button. In the final round, you will only have to press X at the exact moment the correct answer flashes on screen.\n\n\n\nThat Trivia Game has more than a thousand questions in a wide range of categories that are randomly generated. This means that you can play around 40 games of That Trivia Game without seeing repeating questions but the category selection often repeats per round. On four separate games, playing multiplayer, movies, and TV were an option in every round on every game I hosted and books and literature only appeared once out of all the games. There isn’t a campaign to unlock anything, and, at the time of this writing, there isn’t any DLC available either, which left little incentive for me to play on my own. When I couldn’t group a gaggle of friends together to bring on the knowledge I didn’t want to play this game a lot. While playing alone I found the NPC’s to be really dim witted, even on the simplest questions. There isn’t a way to play online, either, but the developer claims in the PlayStation blog comments that there could be a future version that will allow for online multiplayer, which will be a great addition.\n\n\n\nThe game is capable of drawing any player into the game show arena but there’s one audience that will miss out on some of the extra bits of information, prohibiting them from fully sinking into the atmosphere. For players who are deaf or hard of hearing the game is marginally accessible. The game isn’t subtitled at all and there are no options to configure, so deaf players are stuck reading the questions and answers. While playing with my deaf friend, and scoring way higher than him, I had to interpret the point changes, and features of all the rounds. If a hard of hearing player were playing alone, they won’t know the subtle differences in the rounds with the exception of the final round which has a radically different play style, as I said before.\n\n\n\nThat Trivia Game doesn’t have any problems plunking friends together on the same couch with a bag of Cheetos being passed around between rounds. The game draws players into vastly competitive situations, especially when playing with four players because the questions and answers are top notch but there will be some sort of small barrier that some disabled players will encounter. With no motivation to entice players to play on their own, gamers, especially disabled gamers will soon forget this game after the apartment has been cleaned up and everyone goes home. There are trivia games out there that are fully accessible to all disabled players, even the totally blind, such as You Don’t Know Jack . This game doesn’t hold onto the trivia feeling long enough to keep playing. The effort put into the questions and answers is stellar and something that will have people flocking to this game like a tasty cake but, sadly, the cake has no icing, no sprinkles, or even external goodies to make it long lasting. Gamers, including disabled gamers, will find other trivia games that provide more education for their dollar, along with an accessible experience. That Trivia Game could have been a bath of brain benders accessible to everyone but it just isn’t. It could have been, though.\n\n\n\nShare this post\n\n\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nGiveaway - Warface: Collector's Early Access Pack Worth £61.99\n\n\n\nFull details ›\n\n\n\nVersion tested:\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nAlso available on:\n\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\nDeveloper:\n\n\n\nThe Game Room\n\n\n\nPublisher:\n\n\n\nThe Game Room\n\n\n\nGenre:\n\n\n\nTrivia/Party\n\n\n\nStaying up to date\n\n\n\nReceive email updates\n\n\n\nYouTube channel 99k subscribers\n\n\n\nFollow on twitter\n\n\n\nRSS Feed\n\n\n\nLike our Facebook page\n\n\n\nWrite news for DarkZero\n\n\n\nWe're looking for a new face to join our team of volunteers.

Now, I\'m guessing that if you\n\n\n\ndid\n\n\n\npass on playing the first game that it was because you thought it was ""a dumb kid\'s game"" or because ""the game\'s based on the\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nprequels, and those suck."" Well, that second excuse won\'t fly anymore because this sequel is based on the original trilogy. You know, the one that everyone likes.\n\n\n\nAs for that first excuse, the\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars\n\n\n\ngames are more family games than pure kid\'s games (and they\'re hardly ""dumb""). Sure, they\'re simple enough for a kid to pick up and enjoy, and a skilled player can plow through the main story mode in a few hours, but there\'s a lot more depth below the surface.\n\n\n\nFor the benefit of those who may not have noticed the\n\n\n\nmultiple recent previews of the game\n\n\n\n, here\'s what\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II\n\n\n\nis all about. It\'s based on the popular line of LEGO sets that are based on the popular movies. The game\'s Story Mode is split up into three parts, each one focusing on one of the original\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nfilms. Within each of these film-based sections, there are six stages.\n\n\n\nThe first time you play through each stage, the characters that you can control are dependent on the movie\'s storyline. When on the swamp world of Dagobah, for instance, you can only play as Luke, R2-D2, and Yoda since they were the only characters on that planet in\n\n\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\n\n\n. After completing each stage, you typically unlock new playable characters, including most of the enemies that you face in the game. Completed stages can then be revisited in Free Mode, which allows you to select whatever character you want to play as, and a party of other characters is automatically chosen to accompany you in the level.\n\n\n\nThey\'re Full of Surprises\n\n\n\nHaving a wide variety of characters in Free Mode is important since there are lots of secrets to discover and many characters have unique skills. Jedi characters like Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi use their lightsabers to deflect incoming laser fire, and the Force allows them to manipulate certain LEGO elements within each stage. Some LEGO bricks can only be controlled by evil Sith lords. Here\'s where Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine come into play. ""Blaster"" characters are those armed with laser guns, including Han Solo and Princess Leia. They can not only attack enemies from afar with their lasers, but they\'re also armed with grappling hooks that allow them to reach high places. Locked doors need droids to open, so keep R2-D2 and C-3PO around. R2 can even use his leg-mounted rockets (which is only used in the prequel trilogy) to cross large pits. Bounty hunters like Boba Fett can toss explosive thermal detonators that are required to destroy certain objects and obstacles. Making proper use of each of the characters\' abilities is necessary in order to track down all the hidden goodies in each level.\n\n\n\nYour exploration efforts will be rewarded with new gameplay modes, all of which have you competing against the clock (and another player, if you choose). The Character Bonus places you within a maze-like arena inspired by different levels and times you on how quickly you can collect a million LEGO studs (this may sound like a daunting task, but it can typically be done in less than five minutes). If you\'ve played the original\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars\n\n\n\n, you will remember collecting Minikit Canisters which were used to build model vehicles. In that game, the vehicles could just be admired, but now, they have a purpose. Any vehicle that you construct can be used in the Minikit Bonus levels. They play just like the Character Bonus stages, except you can pilot several different ships. If you ever wanted a game that let you fly around one of Jabba\'s skiffs or a Star Destroyer, then look no further.\n\n\n\nNext:\n\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n\n>>\n\n\n\nPage:\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nLatest Reviews\n\n\n\nShin Megami Tensei: Persona 4\n\n\n\n(Dec 18, 2008)\n\n\n\nFIFA Soccer 09\n\n\n\n(Oct 15, 2008)\n\n\n\nYakuza 2\n\n\n\n(Sep 22, 2008)\n\n\n\nTNA iMPACT!\n\n\n\n(Sep 15, 2008)\n\n\n\nGuitar Hero: Aerosmith\n\n\n\n(Jul 7, 2008)\n\n\n\n::\n\n\n\nMore Reviews...\n\n\n\nFollow GameSpy on Twitter\n\n\n\nGet the Latest in Gaming News\n\n\n\nAround the Network\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The... at IGN\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The...

Or Oichi, Meruru, Casty from Ar Nosurge, Firis, one of the girls from Blue Reflection, and any number of my other favourite characters? This game is terrible!\n\n\n\nI jest, of course. Warriors All-Stars actually has a stellar cast, and I’m happy to say upfront that it’s my favourite Warriors game that has ever been produced. It’s rare that Koei Tecmo produces a game that I don’t like, and generally speaking I like the games in great part because I love the characters. So the idea of bringing together heroes from all the company’s various IPs into one giant mash-up was always going to appeal to me on a very deep level. Even putting aside the many licensed games that Koei works on, the characters of which clearly weren’t available (so, no Arslan or Guts from Berserk, sadly), it’s a testament to the sheer depth of Koei’s IP that a roster of close to 30 feels thin. But what is there is delightful, on every level.\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars brings together characters from the following franchises: Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Toukiden, Dead or Alive, Deception, Atelier, Nioh, as well as a couple of incidentals that either haven’t been localised into English (Koei runs some popular dating games in Japan for ladies that it hasn’t seen fit to localise yet), or are truly obscure now – Opoona and Nobunyaga make an appearance, for example. As you can probably assume given the links between these franchises are almost non-existent, the plot that has been built into Warriors All-Stars to explain how they're all together is utterly nonsense; basically they’re all summoned into a fantasy world to help out a fox-faced noble take the throne, and battle others that have the same idea and their own team of heroes.\n\n\n\nBut, while it’s nonsense, the way that each major battle focuses in on one or two different characters does allow Koei to highlight their personalities, and that’s all that’s really important. For characters from franchises who had previously had minimal backstory, this has been an opportunity to get a better sense of them. Marie Rose and Honoka from Dead or Alive 5, for example, came as roster additions only after the original release of the initial game, and so had a minimal role in the broader plot as a result. Their role in Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 following that was simply to look gorgeous while wearing their bikinis. This is the first time that either character has had a core role in an actual plot, and I quite appreciated that. I also liked the opportunity to get to know some of the characters from Koei’s Japan-only franchises for the first time. Darius from Harukanaru Toki no Naka de, especially, is a character I found immediately interesting. And of the other characters, well, I love most of them, so another opportunity to bop heads with Arnice or Sophie, while listening to them talk in character, was most welcome indeed.\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars, as a love letter to fans of everything Koei Tecmo, is also quite delightful in the little references that it throws in along the way for the most committed fans. Anyone who has played enough Atelier games, for example, knows that characters have a weird (and completely unexplained) habit of saying “taru!” (barrel!) every time they see a barrel. A few years ago I was actually talking to the producer of the series about this and, yes, Gust, the developer of the Atelier series, is quite aware that people actively look forward to seeing how each character exclaims “taru!” when he or she spots a barrel.\n\n\n\nSo in Warriors All-Stars, in the main hub between battles, there is, of course, a barrel just sitting there. And every single character has a different way of saying “taru!”. Nobunyaga says it with such complete disdain, which would sound sinister if it was Nobunaga Oda, and not a cute cat with Nobunaga’s voice. Marie Rose, meanwhile is so utterly cute about it, and can Koei please for the love of God give her the lead in her own game next. Most amusing of all, though, is William from Nioh. Good ol’ Bill actually speaks English in a world where all the other characters speak Japanese. That’s in keeping with his character from Nioh itself. But when he sees a barrel, he breaks out the most ridiculously deadpan “taru,” complete with his thick Irish accent. Yes this barrel nonsense sounds like a tiny, little, silly thing, but as a fan of Koei stuff and I giggled stupidly as I checked each and every character’s “taru” as I unlocked them.\n\n\n\nThis is fanservice in the best possible sense. I’m not even going to pretend that this game will appeal to people outside of the Koei faithful. It really won’t. Those people could pick up any other Warriors game and enjoy it far more, because the context will make more sense. You don’t need to care who the characters are in a Samurai Warriors game, because the action and history itself is the focus. But Warriors All-Stars is all about the characters. If you don’t know what a Laegrinna or Arnice is, then you’re just not going to care that they’re there taking down Lu Bu one moment before having a hotspring adventure with a Marie Rose the next (oh yes, I’ve had that dream), and then watching a Plachta and Mitsunari Ishida play beach volleyball shortly after. It also won’t matter that after battles you’re winning the same resources that you collect in games like Trinity: Souls of Zill ‘Oll or Ninja Gaiden. It’s just not going to matter to you. But this merging of worlds is delightful for those of us who\n\n\n\nhave\n\n\n\nspent ungodly amounts of money and time immersing ourselves in Koei worlds in the past, and it’s done with such an eye for detail that you really get a rich sense of the kind of company that Koei has built into one of the most important Japanese developer/publishers out there.\n\n\n\nThe only companies that even comparable, in terms of the raw value that their franchises hold for fans, is Square Enix (which for some reason refuses to do these cross overs), and Nintendo. Warriors All-Stars is every bit to Koei and its fans what Smash Bros. is to Nintendo.\n\n\n\nAnd that’s why I was surprised at first that the roster actually is slight when compared to other Warriors games. To this day I still break out an older, but similar character mash-up in Warriors Orochi 3, which had a near endless stream of characters to play with. And I really,\n\n\n\nreally\n\n\n\nwanted to team Lady Sun up with Marie Rose and Meruru when I first hear that Warriors All-Stars was in development. Alas, that was not to be. But that very short moment of disappointment quickly faded, because I realised that in Warriors All-Stars ever character has a very distinct fighting style, whereas in Warriors Orochi 3 they generally all behaved similarly. On the higher difficulty settings it’s important to actually understand how each character strings combos together, and then optimise those attack patterns. Warriors games are always derided for being “button mashers” but I defy anyone to try to use the same button presses with the heavy, slow William as you’d use for the nimble Marie Rose, or the range-orientated Nobunyaga. It just can’t be done.\n\n\n\nThere are characters that are what you’d called “overpowered.” Plachta is a demon in battle, for example, and I certainly found the game fundamentally easier with her. But that’s the beauty of the game not having a multiplayer focus – balance between characters doesn’t matter. What’s important is that if you play well and you can get through the game with any character, and I certainly found the challenge of mastering some of the less effective characters enjoyable. What they all share is visually entertaining super attacks and plenty of personality in their quips as the battles progress.\n\n\n\nWhat is slightly more disappointing is the limited character customisation. Coming from Spirit of Sanada, which was nearly a JRPG in how you could develop characters, customisation in Warriors All-Stars doesn’t extend far past equipping “cards” which are awarded at the end of battles and can upgrade various statistics and abilities of each character. There’s some strategy in how limited these cards can be. There are a lot of different power up options, but only room on a card for a tiny few of them. So you do need to be really strategic about how you merge them together between battles to power them up. But then, that is a system that we’ve seen in plenty of Warriors games now, and\n\n\n\nthat\n\n\n\nis something I’m getting tired of, as a die hard fan of the genre.\n\n\n\nWhat’s more interesting is the way you can take four allies into battle with you. They’ll fight on their own volition for the most part, but you can also call on them to perform super attacks, or alternatively, pair briefly with you to unleash devastating combos on enemies. Each character has their own version of support, and mixing and matching an optimal team, and then understanding how to best make use of those abilities is a fun learning curve.\n\n\n\nAs with all Warriors games, the basic enemies are distractions, to the point that you’ll spend most of your time ignoring them altogether. Enemy heroes are far tougher and you’ll need to make good use of every resource you’re got available to you to push through them. Additionally, battlefields have “bases” that you need to capture by defeating a certain number of enemies so the “commander” appears. Knock him out and the base changes to your side. These bases have a variety of effects, but it must be said that they’re minor, and tend to be important locations more because that’s where the missions and boss enemies tend to be than there being any strategic impetus for capturing them. Some may find the flow of levels to be overly simple, especially when compared to the likes of Arslan or the Empires sub-series, but I’m fine with it, since the game’s about the heroes anyway, so Koei’s done the right thing in keeping you on the move to these highlights.\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars is a gorgeous game. Enemies themselves are delightful, having been pulled from the various franchise themselves. Bopping the jelly-like punis in the Atelier series has always been a delight. Now you do it on a mass scale. The cute-yet-sinister toy soldiers from the Nights of Azure games is another highlight. The levels are also taken from the franchises; you’ll be battling it out on Zach’s beach from Dead or Alive one moment before invading a castle straight from Nioh the next. The level designs are, again, nothing we haven’t already seen in Warriors games, but seeing those designed dressed up as fanservice for people who have played the games they’re based on is a thrill.\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars is a delight. It’s explicitly a love letter to the Koei Tecmo faithful, and it doesn’t pretend to be otherwise. Does this mean it’s for everyone? No. Not even close. I haven’t played a Warriors game that assumes knowledge of the base material from which the game comes from for quite some time. But that was always going to be the case and those fans that this game is designed for will know what they need to. So the real question is whether Koei Tecmo fans would like a Warriors game – Koei’s most enduring approach to game design – that pulls beloved characters from almost all of their favourite franchises together?\n\n\n\nThe answer to that is: “Of course they will.”\n\n\n\n- Matt S.\n\n\n\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n\n\nFind me on Twitter: @digitallydownld\n\n\n\nPlease Support Me On Patreon!\n\n\n\nTitle : Review: Warriors All-Stars (Sony PlayStation 4)\n\n\n\nPosted by :\n\n\n\nMatthew Sainsbury\n\n\n\nDate : 8/29/2017 11:00:00 PM\n\n\n\nLabels :\n\n\n\nbrawler , Koei Tecmo , PlayStation 4 , PS4 Review , Reviews , Warriors , Warriors All-Stars\n\n\n\nItem Reviewed:\n\n\n\nReview: Warriors All-Stars (Sony PlayStation 4)\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\nout of\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nbased on\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nratings.\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\nuser reviews.\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\nMatthew Sainsbury\n\n\n\nat 8/29/2017 11:00:00 PM\n\n\n\nEmail This\n\n\n\nBlogThis!\n\n\n\nShare to Twitter\n\n\n\nShare to Facebook\n\n\n\nShare Article:\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nGoogle+\n\n\n\nStumbleUpon\n\n\n\nDigg\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nNewer Post Older Post\n\n\n\nBlogger Comments\n\n\n\nFacebook Comments\n\n\n\nDDNet Goods Store\n\n\n\nPosters, apparel, iPhone cases, and much more merchandise for sale!\n\n\n\n100 Best Games of All Time\n\n\n\nWe're on YouTube, too!\n\n\n\nJoin us on Discord!\n\n\n\nCome join in!\n\n\n\nBuy my book; Game Art (By No Starch Press)!\n\n\n\nDigitally Downloaded editor-in-chief, Matt Sainsbury, has written a book about games as works of art, from America to Japan, Australia to Europe.

Some are great, some are just okay, but, for the most part, they have all had something about them to enjoy. Truth is, most of these games are all the same but no matter how many of these games that I play, they just never get old to me. Being able to destroy hundreds of soldiers in seconds with insane, over-the-top attacks is oh so satisfying. So, here we are, and Omega Force has now released Warriors All-Stars. A game that takes of ton of characters from various Koei Tecmo games and puts them all into one fantastic game.\n\n\n\nInstead of having a massive roster of around 100 characters like previous Musou Games (mostly the Warriors Orochi series, which is another ""compilation"" crossover game), Warriors All-Stars instead focuses on a smaller roster of 30 characters from various Koei-Tecmo titles including: Dead or Alive, Ninja Gaiden, Nioh, Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Deception, Toukiden, Nights of Azure and more. From Kasumi, Marie Rose, William, Lu Bu, Yukimura Sanada, Arnice and others, Warriors All-Stars features a very respectable list of fantastic characters for those, like me, who are fans of Koei Tecmo titles. A handful of the 30 characters in the game are selectable from the start, with others needing to be unlocked via the main story mode. Selecting a character at the start determines what story route you will be going down as you represent one of the three main characters of the story: Tamaki, Shiki and Setsuna.\n\n\n\nAll three of the stories, however, are essentially the same idea, and the story itself is pretty underwhelming. An ancient spring which has sustained life on earth for years has died, and thus all of these characters from various franchises all get transported to the world together to help and save the earth. Most of the main story, however, is just a bunch of nonsense about Tamaki, Shiki and Setsuna arguing over who should be the one to claim the new throne. I doubt there is any kind of canon or continuity with any of these franchises, though. I mean, Ayane shouldn\'t be calling Kasumi ""the cowardly traitor"" anymore. The game does feature multiple endings, most of which are joke endings and a true ending, so there is plenty of reason to replay the story mode multiple times over. While it\'s unfortunate that there is only a single game mode—which is story—at the very least, the story mode itself provides a variety of different missions that you can choose from.\n\n\n\nAside from the story missions, there are multiple other side missions and quests on the map that you can choose to play in any order. These missions will have objectives such as preventing an ally from being killed, defeating certain officers, or capturing enemy keeps in a certain amount of time. These missions, when completed, will provide your party members with huge amounts of cash and XP. The thing about these missions, however, is that the difficulty of them can be pretty deceiving. I was running a team where all of my members were around Level 15. I decided to do one of the missions where it said the recommended level was only Level 6. I figured I would be fine, until I got into the mission itself where enemies were taking almost no damage at all from my attacks and I was getting leveled by enemies in just a few hits. The map features a ""fog of war"" system, so when you complete a mission the fog around that mission will lift and reveal more missions to complete. The biggest absence in this game, however, is that there is no free mode that just lets you play missions with any unlocked character you want and level them up. While you can easily replay missions in the story mode, it would be nice if there were a mode where we could screw around without worry.\n\n\n\nBattles in Warriors All-Stars are exactly what you expect. Run around the battlefield, hack and slash hundreds of soldiers, take enemy keeps, eliminate enemy officers. You can bring with you up to four support characters to help you in battle. Each character has their own unique support ability which goes on a cooldown after it\'s used. Some of these abilities include giving back health, buffing your attack damage or your defense, nerfing the enemy, etc. Here is a tip: have Millennia in your lineup at all times. She has probably the most over powered and helpful support move in the entire game, where she pulls in all enemies close by and lets you unleash a Musou attack on all of them. This is incredibly helpful when needing to defeat bosses or officers. The game also features a ""bond"" system. Keeping the same characters in your party will increase their bond and can unlock bonuses, including special team attacks, which can be utilized in battle. That said, these bonds are hardly anything more than small banter that occurs between characters, most of which references their time in the games they represent. For instance, if you don\'t play Dead or Alive, you probably won\'t know why Ayane considers Kasumi to be a ""traitor.""\n\n\n\nThe coolest new feature of the game is the new ""Musou Rush."" During any battle you have the ability to activate Musou Rush which will instantly cause hundreds of soldiers to spawn around you. You are invincible while also gaining increased attack speed and damage. During Musou Rush you can slaughter hundreds of soldiers in mere seconds, and killing a certain amount of soldiers will extend the 20-second time limit of Musou Rush. At the end, you and your teammates then unleash a nuclear explosion which wipes out anyone and anything around you. Then you can stand there and bask in the absolute avalanche of items that you instantly pick up once the rush ends. I think my high score for Musou Rush was around 1,900 kills in 30 seconds.\n\n\n\nOut of all of the Warriors/Musou games that I have played, I would put this one right up there with Warriors Orochi 3 and Hyrule Warriors as one of my favorites. It\'s still the same hack and slash action you have played many times before, but the small changes keep things fresh. That said, this game is total fan service to those who are long-time fans of the series. While it may attract some people who are fans of characters from the various series, I can\'t exactly think that this is going to make any new players of this long-time series. Myself however, I love this game.\n\n\n\nIt\'s pure fan service, and the story is absolute nonsense, but it\'s the most fun I have had playing an Omega Force Musou game in a long time. Fans of this long-running series of games will love this, but it won\'t do much to make anyone looking in give the series a chance.\n\n\n\nRating: 8.5 Very Good\n\n\n\n* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.\n\n\n\nAbout Author\n\n\n\n. I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember. My earliest gaming memories come from playing Lady Bug and Snafu on my fathers Colecovision and Intellivision respectively. It wasnt until I was 6 years old and played a Mortal Kombat 2 arcade machine in a game room at a hotel that I truly fell in love with a videogame. I have so many wonderful memories of my dad and I playing Mortal Kombat on SNES every night after dinner. Throughout my childhood NES, SNES, Gameboy and Sega Genesis were the loves of my life. Here I am 29 years old and still as much in love with videogames as I ever was. And for the record...

This time, though, players get a roster composed of characters from dozens of Koei Tecmo games, and watch how well characters from Ninja Gaiden , Dead or Alive , Deception , Opoona , and many more would get along with one another. It’s unabashed fan service fun for lovers of Koei Tecmo games, and an utter blast to play.\n\n\n\nWarriors All Stars – gameplay images courtesy of Koei Tecmo America\n\n\n\nWarriors All Stars features a story that follows cat people politics, which may not ignite any literary fires, but the game’s interactions between its characters are a big draw. How does Zhao Yun of Dynasty Warriors get along with Oka from Toukiden upon meeting her in the field? What would a run-in between Oka and Darius from Haruka: Beyond the Streams of Time be like? Warriors All Stars features encounters between characters from all over Koei Tecmo’s catalogue, showing that a lot of thought went into making connections between all of its characters.\n\n\n\nMany of these encounters translate into fights in the field. Players are given a world map and central base to play around with, and that map is populated with dozens of missions for players to take on. Many of these will be built around small relationships between the characters, doing rescue missions or fighting battles that draw upon shared stories of building friendships or shared goals.\n\n\n\nWarriors All Stars – gameplay images courtesy of Koei Tecmo America\n\n\n\nThese relationships also grow in other ways. Players can get more intimate information about allies by talking to them as they hang around their home base. They can also take a moment to head to their base’s bath house, getting varied private moments between characters based on their levels and other things. Those friendships even grow in combat, but more on that in a moment.\n\n\n\nNot all the matches are designed around building up friendships. Some will help players build up gold, experience, or cards ( this game’s version of equipment ), doing so through all-out battles, protecting certain sections of the map, saving allies, returning food stores from bandits, and any other excuse Warriors All Stars can find to have players bash enemies.\n\n\n\nExpect to clobber soldiers by the hundreds, and Warriors All Stars offers many ways to keep that entertaining. Players will not be fighting alone; for starters they will be bringing up to five fighters into a single battle. These characters act as AI backup, assisting as players work over basic grunts and more powerful lieutenants.\n\n\n\nWarriors All Stars – gameplay images courtesy of Koei Tecmo America\n\n\n\nThe backup characters have more uses than that, though. Players can tap the D-pad in four different directions to force one of their allies to line up alongside them, and can bring all five together into a steamrolling wall of death. Players can also separately summon each of these characters for a special attack that will do heavy damage, but they may want to use them sparingly as they have a long cooldown.\n\n\n\nThese allies grow in friendship as players use them, filling a buddy bar that grants players extra buffs as they become better pals with their partners. These fill up quickly—encouraging players to try new allies often—and also provide handy boosts in a hurry.\n\n\n\nWarriors All Stars – gameplay images courtesy of Koei Tecmo America\n\n\n\nIf players are more interested in fighting on their own in Warriors All Stars , each character offers unique combat abilities that feel like they set them apart. Many are the wide, swiping attacks players will need to clear the field, but each character’s execution with their weapon—from giant stone fists and swords to the ball on Opoona’s head—looks different enough to keep it fun.\n\n\n\nPlayers also have access to a special power that cranks their power through the roof (they are given one use at the start of the match, and another use for every one thousand kills). Their allies will appear on the sidelines to cheer them on as they use it, and enemies will spawn by the hundreds, allowing players to cleave through them. It’s enough to make players feel like super heroes, and works in a pinch if they are having trouble downing a challenging enemy.\n\n\n\nWarriors All Stars isn’t exactly a pushover, so they may need the help. Depending on which starting character they choose, players will meet certain allies and go through the story in a set way, but they will also have set enemies from other factions, and when Ayane, Ryu, and Nobunyaga Oda all come at once they can easily stomp a careless player. Special powers will help here, but players will also want to pay attention to their Brave level.\n\n\n\nWarriors All Stars – gameplay images courtesy of Koei Tecmo America\n\n\n\nBrave level is a separate power level that is tied to that stage. This begins at one in every match and increases as players complete side objectives, beat strong allies, or capture territory. If a player isn’t around the same brave level as an enemy character, even if they’re technically high level and decked out, they can get crushed easily. This encourages players to hurry up and complete some extra side objectives rather than gun for bosses, and is a welcome way of getting players to do more in a fight.\n\n\n\nWhat isn’t quite as welcome is the card system. Cards are equipment in Warriors All Stars , with characters receiving new cards in fights or through side quests (which can be picked up at the Base). However, the game tosses tons of useless low level cards at the player, and while it lets players merge them in hopes of making better cards, these fusions often result in more garbage cards, even when mixing up higher level ones. It feels like a broken system, and beyond a few handy boosts, their power doesn’t feel necessary to finish the game.\n\n\n\nWarriors All Stars – gameplay images courtesy of Koei Tecmo America\n\n\n\nInteresting friendships between varied characters from multiple games, a fun combat system with some welcome additions, and that same soldier stomping fun as previous Dynasty games make Warriors All Stars a solid Musou game, and may just be what players need who are nervous about the open world of Dynasty Warriors 9 .\n\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n\nInteresting friendships between varied characters from multiple games, a fun combat system with some welcome additions, and that same soldier stomping fun make Warriors All Stars a solid Musou game.\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\nGet the latest gaming stories straight to your inbox!\n\n\n\nSIGNUP\n\n\n\nDon’t worry, we never send spam\n\n\n\n© 2010- 2018 CGMagazine\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\n\n\nPress\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nContests\n\n\n\n© 2010- 2018 CGMagazine\n\n\n\nScroll back to top\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nArticles\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nInterviews\n\n\n\nPreviews\n\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\n\nThe Vault\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nGame Reviews\n\n\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n\n\nComic Reviews\n\n\n\nAnime Reviews\n\n\n\nBook Reviews\n\n\n\nBoard Game Reviews\n\n\n\nHardware Reviews\n\n\n\nMusic Reviews\n\n\n\nTV Reviews\n\n\n\nGuides\n\n\n\nMedia\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nVideo Reviews\n\n\n\nSound Off\n\n\n\nVideo Interviews\n\n\n\nWeekly Goods\n\n\n\nFirst Fifteen\n\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\n\nStore\n\n\n\nClose', ""html\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars (PS4) Review - William Never Expected to Be a Dynasty Warrior\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nFinance\n\n\n\nDeals\n\n\n\nPC Builder\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars (PS4) Review – William Never Expected to Be a Dynasty Warrior\n\n\n\nBy Kai Powell\n\n\n\nAug 29, 2017\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\nShares\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\nGAME INFO\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars\n\n\n\nAugust 29th, 2017\n\n\n\nPlatform PlayStation 4, PC\n\n\n\nPublisher Koei Tecmo\n\n\n\nDeveloper Omega Force\n\n\n\nIn the early days of Dynasty Warriors on the PlayStation 2, every new release felt like a new experience to be heralded in, no matter if it were a core entry, Xtreme Legends, or Empires. As the series grew long in the tooth, it took Omega Force trying to expand into other historical time periods or popular franchises to keep the series feeling fresh. As more and more IP’s grew under the Warriors umbrella, some marketing executive must’ve had the brilliant idea to mix together a majority of the IPs Koei Tecmo has gotten their hands on. The culmination of twenty years of Warriors games is finally here in North America: Warriors All-Stars for the PlayStation 4.\n\n\n\nRelated AMD CEO Says They’re Working on Sony and Microsoft Consoles With “Specific Secret Sauce”\n\n\n\nCrossover cameos are nothing new for the Warriors series, with Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate most famously dipping into the Atelier series, in addition to Soul Calibur and Dead or Alive to bill its roster of one hundred-plus soldiers from multiple franchises. Sadly, Namco properties such as Soul Calibur haven’t made their return in Warriors All-Stars, instead focusing on some of Koei Tecmo’s most famous franchises of recent years, plus a few faces that should feel brand new to American audiences. Ryu Hayabusa, Ayane, and Kasumi are instantly recognizable for anyone that’s played a Dead or Alive title in the past fifteen years, but what about more obscure franchises such as Opoona or Neuromance? Koei Tecmo’s newest IPs also get a fair bit of representation, with a handful of characters from both Toukiden titles as well as the hero of Nioh himself, William.\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the thirty-member roster are returning heroes from both Samurai Warriors and Dynasty Warriors that mark some of the more popular characters in the franchise, yet both Ma Chao and Nobunaga Oda seem to have barely missed the cut. The latter exists in another form, namely that of Nobunyaga Oda of a little known social franchise called Samurai Cats. I appreciate Warriors All-Stars building a diverse roster of characters from some of their more obscure franchises such as Fatal Frame or Rygar. To make fans like myself happy, there’s a wide berth of musical selections that feature that signature Dynasty Warriors heavy metal touch, so if you’ve been aching for some new Monster Rancher tracks, Warriors All-Stars has you covered.\n\n\n\nRelated Spider-Man Creative Director: The Game Wouldn’t Exist If It Wasn’t for PlayStation, Having Mark Cerny Was Great\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Star’s story centers around a power struggle between three furry siblings, each wielding a mystical weapon and each sharing an equal right to succession to a recently vacated throne. Depending on which of the three siblings you choose, the roster will open up with members of that party, though it doesn’t take much time at all to unlock the remaining cast members for the full group. Across an ever expanding world map, fights can be chosen at the player’s discretion and feature a wide array of objectives. Key missions are tagged with yellow or red crystals and need to be undertaken to advance the story. Otherwise, players are free to take on any other mission that pops up, earning additional experience, gold, or cards in the process.\n\n\n\nIn a properly cryptic fashion, certain yellow key missions need to be taken while others ignored if the player wants to reach the true ending with their chosen patriarch unless they want to finish up the story mode quickly and start anew (carrying over character levels and other important stats, of course). I experienced this myself while working to achieve Shiki’s goal, having gained a full roster of characters only to be forced to pick half that number to continue on. Unbeknownst to me, I had picked a group at random to work with and had accidentally forgotten to bring along William, the English samurai from NiOh that I had put in so much work to leveling up and raising affinities for. Because of losing my highest level member, I was forced to spend a longer than usual amount to grind my way back up to fighting form. The story missions I needed to progress were all in the mid-20’s while my highest member that I opted to bring with was only roughly 10. It didn’t take TOO terribly long to get back up to a level that could progress the campaign, perhaps only an hour or two plus a hefty amount of gold to quickly bolster the remaining cast member’s levels.\n\n\n\nWhen you’re heading off to battle in Warriors All-Stars, you aren’t taking that journey alone. More than the single members of Dynasty Warriors or the three-person squads of the last Warriors Orochi title, the diverse cast can work together in five-man teams to achieve their goal. With a lead character that gains all of the experience and perks, four extra party members can join in on the battlefield for additional combos or special attacks. Swapping to another character is only a temporary effect, unlike the freely rotating squads from Warriors Orochi. To offset this, both characters (or up to all five) can all attack at once, covering a much wider range of attack and clearing most bases with ease. The more I played around with different squad compositions in Warriors All-Stars, the more I grew to appreciate this change as it felt all more satisfying to carve up entire groups of enemies at once.\n\n\n\nIf attacking enemies by the dozens doesn’t satisfy your craving of mass combat, Warriors All-Stars has a unique Rush Mode that every character can put to use. For roughly a minute, enemies rush out in greater swarms, numbering in the hundreds that can be cut down in reckless abandon. The higher your kill combo, the more your squadmates will cheer you on, extending the timer and occasionally throwing in an extra attack or two into the fray. With characters that have wide sweeping attacks, such as Lu Bu, it isn’t uncommon to break the thousand-kill count in a single Rush Mode. Of course, the AI takes a hit and simply stands around as you slaughter their companions in battle, but the Warriors series has always offered a sense of gratifying kill counts at the expense of enemies that can properly fight back.\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars offers a small variety of mission types that usually range from either having to defend an objective/officer for a set amount of time or go on the offensive and conquer the battlefield instead. One of the more infamous mission types is brought back from Hyrule Warriors: death battles where both the player and enemy die in a single hit. As these tend to be the fastest way to level a character, it’s worth the challenge, assuming you can survive to the end without getting hit. If possible, take the time to upgrade your player’s card with the Resurrection ability, giving them a second chance to finish the mission before seeing that infamous Game Over screen.\n\n\n\nVariety and diversity are something that Warriors All-Stars aims for, but none of it feels quite as in-depth as the other Warriors titles. There’s a diverse cast, but only from a small number of franchises. There are character upgrades, but only in the form of equipable cards, not in additional weapons and accessories. And lastly, there are diverse battlegrounds that pull from the represented franchises, but again, you’ll be replaying the same maps over and over throughout the story, although with varying objectives each time.\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars does a solid job of trying to bring the Musou series back to its roots after so many of Omega Force’s spinoffs and licensed titles. With a smaller roster than usual, All-Stars tries to showcase some of Koei Tecmo’s popular titles of recent years without giving any of them the attention they so rightly deserve. After enjoying the grand buffet of Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate’s roster, Warriors All-Stars ends up feeling like a tapas dinner: small plates that each have their own flavor but sometimes not quite enough to fill you up.\n\n\n\nReviewed on PlayStation 4 (code provided by the publisher).

What gives?\n\n\n\nWTF Hanging out in the spa with a robot and a couple of serial killers.\n\n\n\nWell, the good people at Omega Force have done it again, proving that there’s no end to the franchises that can be smoothly imported into the musou genre to great results. This time it’s a ‘Best-Of’ compilation, pulling characters from all of Koei-Tecmo’s top franchises (as well as some less popular ones) into a story about a world of fox-people in desperate need of heroes to save them from a cataclysmic event just a few days away.\n\n\n\n…So it’s basically the exact same premise as the Dragon Quest Heroes games, only instead of DQ characters, these desperate people summon an eclectic range of heroes, ranging from the heroic shinobi of Ninja Gaiden an d the murderous psychopaths of Deception , all the way down to a cat version of Nobunaga Oda from an all-feline reimagining of the Romance of Three Kingdoms … which is a real game, apparently?\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars lets players pick which of three various factions to side with at the start of the game, then lets them fight through a series of branching missions while learning the secrets of the world, recruiting new heroes, and working their way towards one of over a dozen endings. All of the missions follows the traditional musou structure with bases to be captured, heroes to drive off, and treasure to collect.\n\n\n\nMuch of All-Stars ‘ charm comes from seeing the faithful translation of familiar characters and locations into an entirely new genre. Running around evil mansions from Deception or sunny Atelier meadows is something I’ve done dozens of times, but seeing them filled with thousands of soldiers thirsty for my blood was a thrilling change of pace. The developers have done an incredible job of making everyone fit into the musou world — while it’s easy to adapt characters who already brawl from Ninja Gaiden or Dead Or Alive , seeing RPG faces like Sophie and Platcha, or a pachinko game hostess like Rio conjuring spells and kicking ass is a complete surprise in the most delightful way.\n\n\n\nThe combat is extremely well-built, faster and more accessible than in other musous I’ve played, presumably to make sure it can be easily played by people unfamiliar with the genre and drawn in by the appearance of favorite characters. In addition to the basic light/strong attacks and super moves, players go into the field accompanied by up to four supporting heroes. While they can’t be freely switched between, each of the supports has a special technique that can be triggered at will, as well as the ability to form a line of attackers. using this ability, up to five characters can be onscreen at once, fighting in unison and wiping out hordes of foes with simultaneous combos.\n\n\n\nThe developers have also done a great job of keeping combat fair even while the player’s characters are monstrously overpowered. This is done via a ‘bravery’ stat that acts as an attack and defense multiplier. Defeating enemies, securing camps, and completing side objectives all fill up the bravery meter, which goes from one all the way up to ten. So, while leveling characters is important, it’s not vital in the way battlefield strategy is. Players are encouraged to start with skirmishes to build up bravery, fighting low-level captains and heroes until they’re strong enough to take on the field’s bosses. This system gives each individual battle its own unique flow, keeping them from feeling repetitive or stale.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the story missions, the developers have come up with a half-dozen other types of missions that players can take on to level up their characters and boost relationship stats between teammates. While most of them are basic battles in a variety of settings, there are also a good number of quirky and innovative fights, including ‘rush battles’ where the player has to continuously defeat foes to keep a timer from running out, ‘death matches’ where one hit will kill anything, and team battles which challenge the player to defeat ten heroes in a row, each stronger than the last. All are intriguing spins on the musou format.\n\n\n\nWhile the story isn’t particularly innovative or surprising, it’s well-told with great voice-acting from the characters. More importantly, All-Stars is incredibly decent about helping someone find all the endings. At any time players can open up the pause menu and take a look at a roadmap for how to unlock various missions and characters – it starts out covered in question marks, but as more and more entries are filled in, it soon becomes a clearly -delineated path showing the way to anything someone might have missed.\n\n\n\nOn one level, it’s incredibly satisfying just to see popular characters from various franchises hanging out with one another. Especially when the franchises are as incredibly different as these – what could William from\n\n\n\nNioh\n\n\n\npossibly have to say to Ayane from\n\n\n\nNinja Gaiden\n\n\n\n? A lot more than one would think, apparently. Beyond the fan-friendly concept, the developers have put together one of the strongest and most playable musou titles, ever, and is a beautiful thing that will satisfy both genre fans and newcomers alike.\n\n\n\nRating: 8 out of 10\n\n\n\nDisclosures: This game is developed by Omega Force and published by Koei-Tecmo . It is currently available on PC and PS4. This copy of the game was obtained via publisher and reviewed on the PS4. Approximately 30 hours of play were devoted to the singleplayer mode, and the game was completed multiple times. There are no multiplayer modes.\n\n\n\nParents: According to the ESRB, this game is rated T and features Alcohol References, Suggestive Themes, and Violence. It’s pretty tame by musou standards, with foes getting knocked out rather than dismembered. Still, a lot of death is discussed, as is the prospect of getting drunk – although that’s not featured. Characters do spend a considerable amount of time in and around spas, though, and are nearly nude as they do so.\n\n\n\nDeaf & Hard of Hearing Gamers: The game is fully subtitled, and features no notable audio cues! It’s fully accessible .\n\n\n\nRemappable Controls: No, this game’s controls are not remappable.\n\n\n\nColorblind Modes: There are no colorblind modes available in the options.\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nLatest Posts\n\n\n\nDaniel Weissenberger\n\n\n\nWhat can you say about a twenty-five-year-old girl who died? Nothing relevant to this conversation, that's for sure! Because we're here to talk about (sorry, write and read about, respectively) GC_Danny, who's updating this profile for the first time in thirteen years! So let's take a gander back at that time and see what's happened! In addition to writing hundreds of video game reviews, Dan produced a book that can be legally purchased by almost anyone! He also wrote two short films, two episodes of television, and two movies! Although, sadly, and through much fault of his own, the movies have yet to be released. In addition to general game reviewing, he's also dabbled in more long-form work, writing some of the longest and most comprehensive game reviews of all time . Then there's his non-GameCritics blogging, where he's famous as the world's foremost expert on the TV show Criminal Minds , as well as the co-host of a weekly podcast - he's even working on a new videogame/critical experiment, which you can find out more about here ! If all that wasn't enough, just a few months ago he rebranded himself as 'The Hidden Object Guru', hoping to stake another claim of ultimate expertise, this time over a genre of casual games! Will he be successful? Only time will tell, but you're free to join the thrilling ride at his YouTube channel !\n\n\n\nLatest posts by Daniel Weissenberger\n\n\n\n( see all )\n\n\n\nSenran Kagura Reflexions Review\n\n\n\n- September 15, 2018\n\n\n\nStrange Brigade Review\n\n\n\n- August 29, 2018\n\n\n\nYs: Memories of Celceta Review\n\n\n\n- August 27, 2018\n\n\n\nTags: Action Atelier Dan Weissenberger Deception Dynasty Warriors Musou Nobunaga PS4 review rio Samurai Warriors\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nComment threads\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nThread replies\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nFollowers\n\n\n\nMost reacted comment\n\n\n\nHottest comment thread\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nComment authors\n\n\n\nRecent comment authors\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nnewest\n\n\n\noldest\n\n\n\nNotify of\n\n\n\nnew follow-up comments new replies to my comments\n\n\n\nGuest\n\n\n\nThe Man from Another Place\n\n\n\nWouldn’t Nubunaga Oda be from Nobunaga’s Ambition, the historical Japanese strategy title?

I’ve certainly not grown tired of it yet, and I don’t think I will anytime soon, especially when the likes of Warriors All-Stars is being freshly served up.\n\n\n\nThe first Warriors mash-up title of its kind, Warriors All-Stars brings together a cast of characters from over 12 franchises, some of which we aren’t too familiar with over here in the West. Rest assured, however, that if you’re a fan of Koei Tecmo’s output, you’ll find at least a handful that you’ll be eager to get to grips with.\n\n\n\nDelving into Warriors All-Stars one and only gameplay mode, you’ll initially have a choice of 12 characters – one from each franchise featured. There’s William from the brilliant Nioh , Kasumi from Dead or Alive , and Nobunyaga Oda from Samurai Cats to name but a few, though as you play, you can recruit many more characters to your team and even take control of them. In fact, there are over 30 characters for you to battle with overall, each with their own unique moveset and special skills.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay itself follows the usual Dynasty Warriors template. As storied heroes of faraway lands, you’ve been summoned to a mysterious world on the brink of collapse, inhabited by a race of anthropomorphic beasts. It transpires that the only way for you to return home is to help save the troubled land by restoring an unusual spring, and with three prominent figureheads all vying to be the next ruler, you’ll find yourself fighting to help one of them achieve their goal.\n\n\n\nCombat is as familiar as ever, with standard and heavy attacks that can be combined to make combos and a screen clearing special attack that’s handy for when you want to defeat enemies fast. Warriors All-Stars also has a few unique systems of its own, making combat just that bit more fanciful.\n\n\n\nWhile you only ever control one character directly in battle, you can take along up to four friends to aid you in various ways. You can extend a devastating combo by bringing them in for a final hit, for instance, or summon them to perform one of their unique skills. You can even make them fight by your side, standing in line to make a formidable wall of violence.\n\n\n\nThey’ll also gleefully cheer you on as you take the spotlight by activating Musou Rush mode. Slowing down time to allow you to mercilessly slaughter hundreds of enemies at your leisure, during Musou Rush mode your friends will look on in admiration, bestowing you with precious additional seconds of time as you reach killing milestones. And when it’s over, you’ll gain a wealth of gold and experience for your showmanship.\n\n\n\nFor all its flair though, capturing bases and defeating the heroes that stand against you toe-to-toe is still the bread and butter of Warriors All-Stars . The zaniness of its cast of characters and the wealth of unique gameplay features truly revitalises the action however, and there’s a lot of it to be done.\n\n\n\nAcross a sprawling world map, you can, and should, engage in a wide variety of field missions, fighting to gain new recruits to stand by your side as well as gold, materials and experience. Of course, there are also story missions to undertake, but by unlocking new characters you may open up new branching paths, changing how the story plays out on the whole.\n\n\n\nCompleting a handful of field missions between each bigger plot-driving battle, I reached my first Warriors All-Stars ending after around eight hours of play. With three storylines to follow, each with their own branching paths and a wealth of character development that can be carried between playthroughs, then, Warriors All-Stars can easily keep you occupied for more than 30 hours.\n\n\n\nAside from the lack of a Free Battle mode, which seems like a strange omission, perhaps the only aspect of Warriors All-Stars that falls flat is its Hero Card system that feels pretty redundant. While you can level up each of your warriors by gaining experience, and unlock some special benefits by building bonds with other characters, Hero cards can be equipped to further boost your stats and provide some additional bonuses. Unfortunately, obtaining and developing good Hero Cards is a convoluted and drawn-out process; one that doesn’t feel like it’s worth the effort.\n\n\n\nI tried both the PlayStation 4 and PC versions of Warriors All-Stars for the purposes of this review. Both have the same content and features, but while the PlayStation 4 version performed admirably aside from some strange framerate issues confined to an introductory mission, the PC version is the one I’ll be going back to thanks to its cleaner visuals and higher framerate.\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars has quickly become my favourite Warriors game of recent times. The great cast, the huge amount of content and the smattering of unique game mechanics all combine to make a game that’s fun despite its repetitive nature. It’s yet again a ridiculous power fantasy, but this time with more colour, wit and humour. That makes it a winner in my book, despite its couple of missteps.\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars is available on PlayStation 4 and PC. We played both versions for the purpose of this review.\n\n\n\nPrevious article\n\n\n\nJCB Pioneer: Mars Lands on Steam Early Access Today\n\n\n\nNext article\n\n\n\nDead Rising 4 is Crawling to PS4 Later This Year\n\n\n\nRichard Seagrave\n\n\n\nRELATED ARTICLES MORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\nWarriors Orochi 4 Gets a Release Date\n\n\n\nNobunaga’s Ambition: Taishi Review: Making History (Again)\n\n\n\nReview: Fox n Forests is a Wonderful Throwback to 16-Bit Platformers\n\n\n\nMotoGP 18 Review: Déjà Vu\n\n\n\nDie for Valhalla!

It’s a simple matter to dismiss Omega Force’s prolific Warriors series as one that’s simply milking the formula for all that it’s worth. Even dedicated fans can find themselves asking, to no one in particular, “really?” This year feels even more over the top than before, with anime adaptations, strategy games and spin-off series launching one after the other. Yet, the developers always make an effort to give each title its own flavor, its own feel. Each comes with a noticeable, but almost intangible, difference that takes the tried and true gameplay and tweaks it. Omega Force’s latest, Warriors All-Stars , is different. Pulling protagonists from all over Koei Tecmo’s stable of characters, this is a heavily anime-tinged, and almost self-consciously silly, take on the evolution of the beat ’em up. It’s something that the series needed.\n\n\n\nNo fan service inspired crossover project can get by without a convoluted plot to bring the heroes together and Omega Force didn’t disappoint. In a world populated by furry bait anime creatures, one fixture is more important than any other: the Spring. A small body of water from which all life springs forth, it has been the subject of numerous legends. It is also dying. Using the Spring’s last remaining magical power, three royal children perform a rite to summon heroes from realms near and far. Heroes that, according to legend, will rescue the world and resurrect the Spring via the healing arts of knocking innumerable heads together. Something goes wrong, though. Instead of the heroes arriving at a centralized location, they are scattered across the world, confused. Each of the three royal children look upon this situation and realize that world ending calamities and otherworldly screw ups are the perfect time to exercise their ambition. They each set forth to gather up heroes under their stable and convince them to not only rescue the Spring, but install their leader as the world’s ruler. Anime!\n\n\n\nA game focusing on mashing franchises up needs to reach far and wide to create an enticing roster. Warriors All-Stars pulls this off. Expected battlefield specialists like Dynasty Warriors’ Lu Bu and Samurai Warriors’ Yukimura Sanada will face off against Ninja Gaiden’s Ryu and Dead or Alive’s Kasumi. As the Warriors Orochi series also exists, this is not too surprising. Then we have characters like Nobunyaga Oda, from Samurai Cats teaming up with Deception’s Laegrinna and things start to get weird. The developers made an intentional decision not to redraw the characters so that they have a unifying art style, giving conversations and battles a jarring lack of cohesion. As these are denizens of other worlds, each with existing fans, it makes sense to maintain the original look of each hero, and frankly, redrawing Sophie from the Atelier series so that she looks more in line with a Musou title would have robbed it of some of the charm.\n\n\n\nThe developers did ensure that the heroes fight like they belong in the same game. My current favorite is Deception’s Laegrinna. For those unfamiliar with the Deception series, it centers around setting chains of traps to send encroaching heroes to embarrassing demises. The “protagonist” is weak in direct combat and must use a malevolent cleverness to punish the righteous. Omega Force translated this into a Warriors character by giving her the ability to throw out a river of traps in front of her, giving her a range that expands the further along the combo string the player goes. Laegrinna can also lay stationary traps during her combo string that can be triggered by pressing the strong attack button. It really works, capturing the flavor of the reference source’s gameplay while still feeling like a straight up Musou title. This type of attention was paid to all of the oddball characters and the game is much more interesting because of it. The only potential complaint that can be leveled at the character selection is in the fact that it is much smaller than that last major cross over title in the series, Warriors Orochi 3.\n\n\n\nThe battles themselves will feel quite familiar to series veterans. Throughout the stages, players are given primary and secondary objectives to complete as they work their way across the field, conquering bases that give passive buffs and provide much needed health items. The wrinkle here is in the Bravery system. At the start of the stage, the player is at a level one Bravery and enemy officers will have their own Bravery level attached. Through accomplishing side missions and just plain knocking the crud out of the enemy, the player’s Bravery level will increase, bolstering their stats. This system is in addition to the already existing character level systems, weapons equipped and use of support characters that join the player in battle. The other fresh introduction comes in the form of the Musou rush. Clicking the right stick activates this mode, and the player has a limited time to cause as many enemy casualties as possible. The enemies don’t stop coming here. Time is added when the player does well enough to cause a supporting character to pop up on the side of the screen and start cheering. In short order, there will be four characters cheering, the player is knocking hundreds of enemies into the air, all to a rainbow colored overlay and peppy music, creating a moment that causes one to wonder what illicit substances the design team was enjoying. It’s bizarrely cool.\n\n\n\nOne new aspect to character improvement comes in the form of the equipable cards. This can be confounding initially as some cards can be fed to other cards, like a free-to-play mobile game. They can also be broken down, sold and enhanced. The easiest way to get around this is just to think of them as weapons. That’s all they are in the end. Once the player switches their internal understanding, the collection of these things makes perfect sense. It’s almost as though the developer realized that cards were popular right now and wanted to capitalize on the trend, but didn’t know how to do it.\n\n\n\nThe biggest issue here comes in the form of the lack of multiplayer. These games were made for the cooperative experience. Playing Final Fight solo is a decent time, but playing with a friend is so much better. As these games are the evolution of that style of play, it brings along the same needs. This is a drum that has been beaten before and it’s one that will continue to pop up as long as Omega Force ignores the best feature of the series since Dynasty Warriors 3 . For the record, it doesn’t need to be online. We’re just looking for local co-op and are willing to except that the framerate and pop in will go pear shaped when rendering that stuff. We’re used to it and don’t mind.\n\n\n\nClosing Comments:\n\n\n\nLack of local multiplayer notwithstanding, Warriors All-Stars is another worthy entry into the Musou series. This is one for fans who want to get a little silly with it and ones who have an affinity for other Koei Tecmo titles. It provides players with a respectable roster of heroes that don’t belong together to go to town, creating a unique experience under a well-known template. It also provides hours of gameplay, with branching paths and multiple heroes to use. Most importantly, it is rife with opportunities to inspire the Rule 34 crowd. They come aboard and the franchise is set for life.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nReviewer\n\n\n\nJason Bohn\n\n\n\nReview Date\n\n\n\n2017-08-29\n\n\n\nReviewed Item\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars\n\n\n\nAuthor Rating\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nVersion Reviewed: PlayStation 4\n\n\n\n© 2018 Hardcore Gamer LLC.

Most impressive.\n\n\n\nBy Jeremy Dunham\n\n\n\nOne of last year\'s more pleasant surprises was undoubtedly LEGO Star Wars, the TT Games-developed ode to George Lucas\' incredibly popular sci-fi universe. With its unique art style, ""pick up and play"" mechanics, and the best use of a popular license that we\'d seen in a long, long time, it literally came out of nowhere to win critics and consumers over with its charming mix of action and humor. With a resume like that and three movies that could still be ""LEGOfied"" remaining, a sequel was inevitable.\n\n\n\nEighteen months later we have it (and for the first time, on PSP). Like The Empire Strikes Back which inspired it, LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy improves on its predecessor in just about every way. Its stage design, source material, musical score, visual presentation, and jokes are all of a higher quality than they were before. There are even a number of additions that are new for the series altogether and extra mini-games thrown in just for the heck of it. In other words, The Original Trilogy is almost the perfect sequel.\n\n\n\nExplaining how LEGO Star Wars works is actually quite simple. The main gameplay mechanics are essentially the same one-dimensional bits that make up most actioners out there (with an attack, jump, and special button available). Using basic strikes and defensive skills, players will regularly chop or blast their way through an unending army of Stormtroopers, Sand People, and Bounty Hunters while fighting the occasional boss or mid-boss every couple of levels. But that\'s where it\'s similarities to other titles ends.\n\n\n\nWhat makes LEGO Star Wars truly unique is that players will be in control of at least two characters at a time, and sometimes as many as six. With a quick tap of the button, gamers can hop back and forth between anybody in their party -- be they Jedi, Rebel, Droid, or whatever -- and each of these archetypes play entirely different. So while Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi may be ideal for taking out large groups thanks to their jumping lightsaber attacks, only droids can access certain areas that allow you entry to the next section. Moreover, the standard blaster characters can mean the difference between life and death when fighting enemies from a distance and Traveller\'s Tales has done an excellent job of balancing things so that you\'ll have to rely on all these styles to succeed.\n\n\n\nThis combination of straightforward mechanics and a clever use of strategy is what makes LEGO Star Wars so fun to play. But character selection for battles and the occasional door access isn\'t all there is to it. Part of the game\'s brilliance is how it mixes puzzles with combat and how it makes use of the LEGO license by allowing players to build or destroy structures. Fans of the first game are no doubt familiar with this system, but LEGO Star Wars II has added a few new goodies to make the puzzles that much more elaborate and the pace that much faster. The fact that any non-droid character can now build items instead of just a Jedi, for example, encourages the use of non-force personalities more than before. Multi-screen puzzles with a couple of multi-solution outcomes are also welcome additions, while the inclusion of about a billion secrets is a good thing too.\n\n\n\nIf multiplayer is your thing, then LEGO Star Wars has that also. Just like last year\'s title, The Original Trilogy allows for immediate ""Drop in/ Drop Out"" two-player co-op at any time (via Ad Hoc) with a few small tweaks thrown in for good measure. Take the camera, for instance. Now it draws back much further than it use to before requiring characters to move closer to one another. There\'s an all-new (and extensive) character creation feature built-in as well, and it allows users of vastly different play styles and preferences to hook up however they want. Sadly, infrastructure co-op isn\'t supported in LSW2, and even if you\'re playing via Wi-Fi, if one person moves to the next screen by himself, player two is auto-transported to that location no matter what he might be in the middle of doing.\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNext »\n\n\n\nWiki Guide 25 Pages\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\n17 Games Were Released For the Switch Today\n\n\n\nDick Grayson and Jason Todd Face Off in Our Exclusive Titans First Look\n\n\n\nBreaking Bad Star Cast in Westworld Season 3\n\n\n\nAssassin\'s Creed Odyssey DLC Plan Announced\n\n\n\nSpider-Man Miles Morales Returns in New Marvel Series\n\n\n\nThe Predator Review\n\n\n\nMarvel\'s Infinity Wars Introduces Hybrid Heroes\n\n\n\nWhy It\'s Insane That Warner Bros.

This time around, plenty of familiar faces from across the Koei Tecmo universe have come together to duke it out so let's get ready to hack and slash.\n\n\n\nBeating on hundreds of enemies is quite a change of pace for Sophie\n\n\n\nWhen I first started playing Warriors All-Stars, I didn't really understand what was going on. I figured it was just your average Dynasty Warriors formula but man, was I wrong. The core gameplay of hacking and slashing then unleashing the odd special move is intact but there's much more here than you'd expect. The most notable mechanic is the bravery system. As I began playing, I didn't consider how much of an effect this system had on success so I perished frequently but after figuring it out, I can say that it's quite a cool dynamic. Basically, whenever you claim bases for yourself (which is fun in its own right) or beat up key enemies then your bravery level will go up which makes you much more powerful. If your bravery is significantly lower than your enemy's then you'll likely lose the fight. So, the key to victory is to increase your bravery then let all hell break loose. It's engaging and addictive stuff.\n\n\n\nOf course, the characters of Warriors All-Stars are what give the experience its heart and soul. You'll eventually meet a large cast of heroes from games in the Koei Tecmo universe including Atelier Sophie , Nioh , Deception, Dead or Alive 5 , Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Toukiden , and Ninja Gaiden. Even Opoona is here which is just awesome for fans of the obscure JRPG (like me). It's kind of disappointing that there are only Japanese voices but the world is so full of charm and fun and that more than makes up for it.\n\n\n\nEvery Japanese game needs at least one character who just thinks about food\n\n\n\nBesides the immersive bravery system, there are a few other mechanics that'll keep you hooked. Characters form relationships with each other the more they fight together and considering how many heroes are available; it's very interesting to watch everyone's affinity gradually grow. Each hero can also level up and equip a card to provide boosts. One of the coolest systems is story progression where you slowly uncover a massive map that's full of missions to take on. Some of them are only available for a few seconds so just scanning around the map can result in some exciting times. There are many endings to discover, too, so the campaign is anything but short. With so much to see and do, Warriors All-Stars goes above and beyond what gamers would expect from a typical Musou game.\n\n\n\nAll of that being said, Warriors All-Stars almost entirely consists of this story campaign and doesn't include any additional modes or multiplayer features. There is an extensive encyclopedia and gallery that you can try and fill out fully but besides that, there isn't really any extra content. Playing cooperatively would probably be very fun so the lack of a multiplayer component is especially disappointing.\n\n\n\nPlachta doesn't look like she appreciates Ayane's tone\n\n\n\nEach character has their own set of moves that's quite enjoyable to master. Most of these involve using a strong attack at the end of a succession of normal attacks. Aside from that, you can perform a special attack when your meter is full, enter Musou Rush mode once you have enough kills, and command your allies to unleash hero skills whenever they can. Although this is a lot of moves, the core gameplay doesn't really change much throughout the campaign and it starts becoming repetitive after a while. That being said, it certainly isn't as monotonous as most similar games but the tedium still eventually starts to sink in so don't expect to enjoy it for hours at a time.\n\n\n\nAs I've already touched upon, Warriors All-Stars isn't a stereotypical Musou game and it has quite a steep learning curve as a result. Once you get into the groove and start to understand how to effectively play, it can be a ton of fun. However, less patient gamers may be put off by this. Therefore, I wish there was an interactive tutorial besides the explanation screens that pop up every now and then.\n\n\n\nNobunyaga Oda sure is cute for a Great Devil\n\n\n\nWith an enjoyable take on the Musou formula and boasting a fantastic cast of both mainstream and obscure Koei Tecmo characters, Warriors All-Stars is sure to delight a variety of fans and perhaps recruit a few new ones in the process.\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nEngaging gameplay with an addictive bravery system and enjoyable special moves\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nLoads of fun characters\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nRewarding story mode progression\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nCore gameplay starts becoming rather repetitive after a while\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nCould use additional modes\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nSteep initial learning curve\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nout of\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nLabyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk Review\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider Review\n\n\n\nDivinity: Original Sin II Definitive Edition Review\n\n\n\nBlade Strangers Review\n\n\n\nSNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy Review\n\n\n\nCandleman: The Complete Journey Review\n\n\n\nTop 10s\n\n\n\nTop 10 Speedruns from SGDQ 2018\n\n\n\nTop 10 Super Metroid Moments\n\n\n\nTop 10 Xbox 360 Shoot 'em Ups\n\n\n\nArticles\n\n\n\nUnique Indie Games\n\n\n\nCasual Console Games\n\n\n\nRetro-Inspired Indie Games\n\n\n\nGameplay video for Warriors All-Stars\n\n\n\n8:04\n\n\n\nPrevious review\n\n\n\nSongbringer\n\n\n\nNext review\n\n\n\nWindjammers\n\n\n\nYou may also be interested in these: Berserk and the Band of the Hawk Review , Dragon Quest Heroes II Review , Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree's Woe and the Blight Below Review , Attack on Titan 2 Review , Toukiden 2 Review , Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star Review , Atelier Lydie & Suelle: The Alchemists and the Mysterious Paintings Review , Dissidia Final Fantasy NT Review , Nights of Azure 2: Bride of the New Moon Review , and Blue Reflection Review .\n\n\n\nDiscover more games that play like Dynasty Warriors , games developed by Omega Force , and games published by Koei Tecmo .\n\n\n\nFiled under:\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n›\n\n\n\nPlayStation 4\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review then share it on Reddit .\n\n\n\nShare this review\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\nShare on Google+\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\n\n\nShare on Reddit\n\n\n\nShare via email\n\n\n\nComments for Warriors All-Stars Review\n\n\n\nA.J.

For fans of both Samurai Warriors and Dynasty Warriors , the crossover was a big deal since they finally saw fan favorite characters interact. The company itself has enough characters and franchises that are ripe for the proven Musou formula, and what better way to put them all together than in one big crossover title, Warriors All-Stars ?\n\n\n\nThe story is somewhat expected for a big crossover title like this. A faraway world is on the brink of dying due to a spring that has stopped providing its life-giving water. The widowed queen, who\'s also a priestess of the world, foretold that only heroes from other worlds would be able to save them from doom. The heroes were summoned, but the spell wasn\'t strong enough to have them gather in one place, and they were scattered all over the kingdom. The queen\'s two children and her nephew went their separate ways to gather these heroes to save the world — while attempting to win the throne for themselves.\n\n\n\nThe generic story is an excuse for the characters of the various franchises to be in the same world at the same time, and it doesn\'t get better as you progress. The three characters fall into the expected anime tropes and aren\'t interesting in their own right. Even if you\'re not familiar enough with the characters, their interactions in the cut scenes are often amusing enough to play through the game multiple times in order to see them all. The only drawback is that some of the more interesting dialogue pieces come in the middle of a fight, so you\'ll often be too busy to appreciate what\'s being said.\n\n\n\nThere are roughly 30 playable characters throughout the entire game, and while that roster count may seem small to Musou fans, the breadth of the game library more than makes up for that. Musou fans will appreciate the appearance of fan favorites like Lu Bu and Yukimura Sanada, but those familiar with the company\'s popular and obscure games will also see their favorites represented. Given the popularity of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive , it shouldn\'t be surprising to see Ryu Hayabusa, Kasumi and Marie Rose. Fans of the Atelier games will appreciate seeing Plachta and Sophie Neuenmuller, and characters from both Toukiden and Deception also make appearances. Even William from this year\'s big hit Nioh is present, but the more interesting characters are from obscure titles such as Rio from the pachinko game of the same name, Opoona from the very obscure Wii title, and Nobunyaga Oda from Samurai Cats , an old trading card game from the early days of the Android.\n\n\n\nFor the most part, the fighting mechanics follow the basics of the Musou formula rather closely. You have the basic and strong attacks, which can be chained together to create some good combos. Hit enough enemies to build your super meter, and you can unleash a super move to take out more enemies at a time or deal hefty damage to a boss or captain of the outpost. Leveling is also back, so you can increase your stats automatically and learn some new combos for your character. Mounts are not here, however, so you\'ll have to run to all of your battles instead of relying on a horse or similar creature.\n\n\n\nFollowing that Musou formula also means that the game comes with those same criticisms that are so ingrained in the series that fans accept them as part of the charm. Enemies still use their time-honored tactic of crowding around you and waiting to be hit. The battlefields are more like labyrinths with their winding corridors and pathways, and while there\'s always one central objective, so many ancillary ones pop up during a battle that you\'ll likely run around the battlefield exploring every nook and cranny. Outposts litter the field, and while some have bonuses like refilling your health, they all require killing a set number of people before you have an opportunity to take over.\n\n\n\nThe crossover theme isn\'t limited to the characters. While the layout of some stages is the same as some of the levels in earlier titles, they take on the themes of the other games, whether it\'s a full-fledged casino or an interpretation of a medieval European town. The enemies also take on the themes, so while you may usually fight anthropomorphic canines, you\'ll also run into smiling slime creatures and feudal Japanese soldiers. The creature and environment themes often clash, so there\'s more crossover to be had at every turn.\n\n\n\nOne of the newer additions to the fighting mechanics is the Bravery system. Much like a MOBA, Bravery is a separate sort of level that\'s contained in each battlefield. It climbs at a much higher pace than your regular XP and is gained more swiftly once you accomplish various side tasks, such as killing a number of soldiers under five minutes. That Bravery system acts as a gateway for how far you can go in a battle, since enemies with higher Bravery aren\'t damaged much by your attacks. The mechanic is interesting on paper, but it feels like an artificial way of extending the game since players were never gated like this in the past.\n\n\n\nUnlike the last time that Koei Tecmo shoehorned a few Dead or Alive cameos into Warriors Orochi 3 , the inclusion of these characters means that they all have attacks of their own. Ayane and Honoka go in without weapons. Sophie summons large bombs and creatures from the sky and administers electric shocks. Laegrinna implements traps for her attacks, so her character is faithful to her Deception roots. Rio has the more oddball attacks, as she uses giant dice, poker chips, a roulette wheel and slot machines for attacks. The fighters feel very different this time around, giving players a reason to change characters to see those variations.\n\n\n\nThough most of the elements will be familiar, there are a few new things thrown in for good measure. You now have the ability to take four additional characters into battle. They\'ll automatically follow you and attack on their own or become part of your combo chain. You can also summon them for special abilities, like health refills or to dispel curses placed on you. They can also be called upon to link up with you, so you can take control of all of them simultaneously for a limited time. One of the more interesting abilities in your arsenal is Musou Rush. Given to you at the beginning of each battle and earned once more for every 1,000 kills, Musou Rush puts you in a frenzied state where, for 20 seconds, an endless supply of enemies surround you and you\'re free to kill as many as you can. Your allies appear on-screen to cheer you on, and reaching certain milestones extends your time in this mode. Once the timer expires, you unleash a final screen-clearing attack and gain a ton of items.\n\n\n\nOutside of combat, the game has seen some other changes. Much like the recent Samurai Warriors: Spirit of Sanada , the game has a central hub town, where you can talk to people for fun or see the crossover characters do things, like play with slot machines and arcades or play volleyball. Useful activities in the hub town include getting special missions in exchange for items that can be used to augment character cards. Those character cards, which are gained in battle, can power up characters with abilities like extra fire damage, resistance to certain curses, or blocking rear attacks. Cards can also be sold for cash or crafted into newer cards, so copies of the same character card don\'t go to waste. The town also features a sparring area where players can grind for XP without starting a full-blown mission. Finally, the affinity system means that you gain abilities when you have someone else in your party, as long as you keep partnering with them over time.\n\n\n\nThe mission structure, however, is completely new. Finish the first training mission, and you\'ll be introduced to a huge world map that functions similarly to a map in a RTS game. New areas are opened up once you complete a mission that\'s next to a darkened zone. From here, you can access the next story-based mission, but that are surrounded by several side missions, which include tasks like raiding bases, protecting bases and gaining new characters for your party. There are even missions that\'ll only appear for a short period of time, and you\'ll receive big bonuses for finishing them. The missions are enough to keep you busy and lengthen each character\'s game, so even though the roster may be smaller than usual, the overall game length for completionists is on par with those older titles.\n\n\n\nSadly, Warriors All-Stars is very sparse when it comes to modes. Story mode is the only actual game mode here with the rest of the game being taken up by galleries and encyclopedias for every character here. With things like co-op and free roam gone, the game can feel rather lacking for those well versed in past entries.\n\n\n\nThe audio is all over the place, but in a good way. The game maintains the series\' use of Japanese-only audio, which makes for great voice work at the expense of being able to follow the story during battle sequences. The sound effects are solid, but the music is the real treat. Since this is a crossover title, you\'ll get some familiar songs from every represented series, but they come in two flavors: the original and a newer version that\'s done in the series\' famous guitar rock style. It\'s a nice touch that fans will appreciate.\n\n\n\nGraphically, Warriors All-Stars brings back memories of the series during the PS3 era. The environments are fine but don\'t display much flourish, even when the themes are different from what the series has seen before. The characters are a bright spot, as they retain the same appearance from their original games. Seeing Hajime Arima from Haruka: Beyond the Stream of Time show up in complete cel-shaded form may contrast with the 3-D environments, but it looks better than having that character\'s appearance become mangled in full polygonal 3-D. The frame rate is a letdown, as we\'re back to a sub-30 fps after finally cracking a more consistent 60 fps. It\'s baffling since there isn\'t a massive increase in simultaneous fighters on-screen and the special effects have been pared back.\n\n\n\nYour reaction to Warriors All-Stars will depend on how big of a Musou fan you are. If you\'re a hardcore fan of the series and have played through many of the main entries and a number of the side titles, then you may be fine with renting this one or getting it when it\'s cheaper. The crossover appeal and the new mechanics are very nice, but the lack of modes can make this feel incomplete. If you\'re a more casual fan or new to the series, this is much easier to recommend, as it\'s a good introduction to past games and prepares you for the changes in the upcoming ninth game in the main series.\n\n\n\nScore: 7.5/10\n\n\n\nMore articles about\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\n\n\n\ncomments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\nblog comments powered by\n\n\n\nDisqus\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nReviewers\n\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\n\n\n\'Oh My Godheads\' (ALL) Comes To Nintendo Switch - Trailer\n\n\n\nPS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'11-11: Memories Retold\'\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'The Adventure Pals\'\n\n\n\nCapcom Cancels Several Development Projects At Vancouver...\n\n\n\n\'Kingdom Hearts III\' (ALL) Introduces Big Hero 6 World -...\n\n\n\nEverything else\n\n\n\nJoin Us!\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n©2000-2018 Worthplaying', 'html\n\n\n\nYahoo\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nMail\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nView\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\nGroups\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\nShopping\n\n\n\nYahoo\n\n\n\nSign in\n\n\n\nLoading Updates\n\n\n\nMail\n\n\n\nSign in to view your mail\n\n\n\nSkip to Navigation\n\n\n\nSkip to Main content\n\n\n\nSkip to Related content\n\n\n\nMail\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFinance\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\nMore...\n\n\n\nClose this content, you can also use the Escape key at anytime\n\n\n\n\'We really think he was trying to provoke us\'\n\n\n\nFlorida police are involved after an encounter between four black students and an armed white man, who was trying to prevent them from entering a building, goes viral.\n\n\n\nVideo shows gun in man\'s hand »\n\n\n\n5704\n\n\n\npeople reacting\n\n\n\n\'Storm of a lifetime\' closes in on Carolinas\n\n\n\nActress called out for Clinton-Trump comments\n\n\n\n\'I am happy to dance on his professional grave\'\n\n\n\nAfter bike price was nearly doubled, sales spiked\n\n\n\nBad news for Oklahoma City Thunder fans\n\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\nCelebrity\n\n\n\nEntertainment Tonight\n\n\n\nMadonna&aposs Daughter Lourdes Leaves Little to the Imagination During Racy NYFW Runway Show\n\n\n\nThe 21-year-old model was basically topless in the Gypsy Sport show.\n\n\n\nLourdes Leon Leads The Next Class Of Celebrity Models At Gypsy Sport\n\n\n\nRefinery29\n\n\n\nNYFW Battle: Badgley Mischka vs. The Blonds\n\n\n\nZoomin TV\n\n\n\n6421\n\n\n\nReactions\n\n\n\nAnnonces Mercedes-Benz Suisse\n\n\n\nLe GLA dès CHF 199.- par mois.\n\n\n\nLe GLA s’adapte à une seule chose: à ta vie.

While the Dynasty and Samurai Warriors games have been criticized for being rehashes of the same storyline, I’ve been surprised with games like Warriors Orochi 3 and the licensed spin-offs from Legend of Zelda to One Piece, and think the tried and true beat-em-up/hack-and-slash formula has some life left in it. To commemorate a whole slew of games, Koei-Tecmo released Warriors All-Stars, a crisis crossover event featuring characters from different titles of the company. With a cast of thirty characters, does it have what it takes to become the pinnacle of the franchise?\n\n\n\nWith more than a dozen series represented in Warriors All-Stars, it’s only natural that an original storyline would hastily connect them together: in a kingdom far away, a magical spring is starting to wither. Princess Tamaki summons heroes from all over time and space, but an unfortunate accident causes them to become separated. Due to this, characters will join forces with either Tamaki, older brother Shiki, or cousin Setsuna to try and save the kingdom from destruction, with the ulterior motive to claim the throne as their own. The campaign that you enter depends on which one of the initial playable heroes you select. The initial storyline, while slightly generic and underwhelming at times, is serviceable enough to get engaged, and near the end becomes more intriguing.\n\n\n\nNow, the main draw here is the character roster. While Warriors Orochi tackles a crossover between the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors franchises, Warriors All-Stars is more of a celebration of different series in general. While you have your usual Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors representatives (including a new addition to the upcoming Dynasty Warriors 9, Zhou Cang), you’ve got other characters from popular games like Ninja Gaiden and Nioh to obscure titles that haven’t seen the light of day here in North America (Rio is a representative of… Rio, a gambling game that was Japan-exclusive). It’s an eclectic cast that really highlights the diverse gameplay of Koei-Tecmo, and it really shows since many of them play distinctly from one another; Ryu Hayabusa can zip through enemies quickly, while Rio employs a bevy of casino related items in the fray. While you do get a good portion of selectable characters to start out with, you’ll have to unlock the others during a playthrough, and that’s where the meat of the game lies.\n\n\n\nThe first couple of stages (where you’re dropped into a scenario based on which character you picked first), will acclimate the basic game flow of most of the game: you have different bases you can liberate from the enemy, highlighted as blue (yours) and red/yellow (other opponents). After beating enough enemies, you’ll take the base for yourself and be granted with whatever bonus that base acquired, ranging from health pickups to random equipment. Aside from that, you have sub and main missions, the latter of which you’re required to fulfill in order to win the stage.\n\n\n\nWhile a one man army initially, you can recruit up to four more characters in order to fight alongside you as bodyguards. With the tap of a button, you can either summon them for a brief support attack or momentarily control them before you have to reset a cooldown gauge to use them again. These also tie into a bravery system; the more enemies you kill in a stage, the higher your bravery increases. This can lead to more devastating support attacks, which help out in the long run. It was cool seeing weaker party members become wrecking balls midway into a stage, and I love that feeling of destroying your enemies when they have the upper hand. Additionally, forming a party with different members will unlock different regard towards you, which will increase the more you interact with them. This can grant you bonuses like gallery unlocks to hero cards (Which acts as Warriors All-Stars’ weapon equipment), and it’s worth switching your party around to level up each person’s regard meter.\n\n\n\nOther than your basic attacks (which you can chain together for combos), you have your devastating musou attacks (which can be unleashed once you give or receive enough damage), and a star rush, which will randomly place literally thousands of mooks in your line of sight so you can mow them down like the Sunday lawn. While this last attack is admittedly entertaining to watch the first few times, after an hour of playtime, it just becomes repetitive and tedious. It was a cool addition at first, but ends up being a bit distracting.\n\n\n\nAfter these stages, you will open a world map and different activities will appear on the screen. These activities can range from ally garrisons (where you protect a base from enemies), to monster battles (where it’s basically a regular stage, except with MONSTERS!). Like the star rush attacks, they’re a cool addition at first, but they end up becoming repetitive filler the longer you play, which is a shame because the rest of the game is pretty solid.\n\n\n\nAside from the generic missions you can encounter during gameplay, a number of key battles and hero battles will also unlock as you level up. While the former advances the main plot, the latter influences your current party: by choosing to fight different battles at different times, and even having a certain character in your party, you can recruit more heroes into your roster. In between stages, you can also rest at a central hub, where you can accept missions from heroes as well as hang out with them in the spa. These small interactions highlight the eclectic nature of the cast, and it’s always funny seeing William from Nioh fail at an arcade game.\n\n\n\nBecause of how factions work, around half the cast is unavailable for most of a given playthrough (save the true ending), so it’s a game that encourages different branching playthroughs, and will reward different endings based on criteria met. With so much to do, it’s actually a pretty neat idea to increase the replay value of the game. I just wished the padding of the generic stages wasn’t so prevalent.\n\n\n\nWith so much to unlock and experience, it’s interesting to see which endings you can unlock; these are also key battles that appear after meeting certain criteria. However, one of the biggest flaws with this game is that it’s single-player only. While 30 characters is admittedly small for a Warriors title, the fact that the cast plays very differently means that it would’ve been suitable for couch co-op, a staple in almost every Warriors game to date. The exclusion of it is jarring, and I really wanted to play this with a friend. It’s not like the PS4 can’t handle it, either. The lack of multiplayer is by no means a deal breaker, but the omission will be felt for those that want a co-op Warriors game. It would’ve been cool to see some enemies from different series pop up as well, not just a select assortment of monsters; as it stands, beating anthropomorphic troops is unique to the game, but it could’ve been cool to fight some NPCs from Dead or Alive or the Atelier games.\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\nWarriors All-Stars\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nReview Guidelines\n\n\n\nWhile Warriors All-Stars isn’t the best crossover, it’s great for fans of Koei-Tecmo. With a lovely cast of characters and a whole lot of content to unlock, it’s a good way to pass the time until Dynasty Warriors 9. Just be prepared to go through the motions more than you’d like to.\n\n\n\n— Elisha Deogracias\n\n\n\nPROS\n\n\n\nWide range of different characters and playstyles\n\n\n\nA bevy of content and information to unlock\n\n\n\nIn-game character interactions are used pretty well\n\n\n\nCONS\n\n\n\nNo multi-player is a glaring omission\n\n\n\nSome mechanics can get tedious pretty quickly\n\n\n\nWould’ve been cool to get some more references of the represented franchises\n\n\n\nElisha Deogracias is an aspiring accountant by day, freelance writer by night.

It was a curious combination, but it worked because the gameplay was novel enough, the combined nostalgia for Star Wars and Legos was potent, and the experience was delivered with a humorous, lighthearted flair. Lego Star Wars II is an even better package than the original, due almost entirely to the fact that the emotional connection to A New Hope , Empire Strikes Back , and Return of the Jedi is much stronger for most people.\n\n\n\nIt works best as a nostalgia piece, but Lego Star Wars II is good fun on its own.\n\n\n\nYou start out in the Mos Eisley Cantina, which serves as a hub from which you can access all three episodes, as well as a counter where you can purchase extras like cheats and additional playable characters, and a new character creation counter. Initially you\'ll have access only to A New Hope, though you\'ll gain access to Empire and Jedi after beating the first chapter. The game hits nearly all of the most memorable sequences from all three films, and it does it all with a goofy sense of humor. Since the game will no doubt attract some hardcore Star Wars fans, it\'s also worth noting that Lego Star Wars II seems to be taking most of its cues from the original theatrical releases. This means you can expect Han to shoot first, Darth Vader to have eyebrows, and Return of the Jedi to end with the classic ""Yub Yub"" Ewok song. They\'re all minor points, but it\'s the kind of stuff that fans will definitely appreciate.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II is still primarily an action adventure game in which you control a group of characters as they blast their way through enemies and do some light puzzle-solving and the occasional platform-jumping. The size of your group expands and contracts regularly, growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times. You control only one character at a time, and you can switch characters easily on the fly. Your artificial intelligence-controlled companions are pretty worthless, save for a few specific scripted sequences. There\'s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters, which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed. Usually, though, the characters you\'re dragging around are there for a reason, as there are several different classes of characters, each with unique abilities that you\'ll need to progress. Jedi characters sport lightsabers, can perform double-jumps, and can use their Force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment. Regular hero characters like Princess Leia and Han Solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot. C3PO and R2D2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment, and R2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances. Short characters like Jawas and Ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n\n\nThese character classes were all in the original, though they\'ve been tweaked slightly. All nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of Legos into usable devices, something that originally only Jedi were capable of; many blaster-wielding characters will now auto-dodge incoming blaster fire; and most characters now have unique melee attacks--it\'s great to watch Chewie rip a stormtrooper\'s arms right out of their sockets or to see Lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were Ryu. Not only do all these refinements make non-Jedi characters more useful, they also lend the game a bit more personality. New to Lego Star Wars II are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters. Since you\'ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode, you\'ll have to rely on special helmet machines, which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter. It\'s a fragile ruse, though, because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off. The bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators, which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original. You\'ll happen upon small carts, landspeeders, and AT-STs that you can pilot in the action adventure chapters, though there are also chapters dedicated to memorable sequences like destroying both of the Death Stars, fighting off imperial forces in your snowspeeder on Hoth, and racing speeder bikes through the forests of Endor. These dedicated vehicle chapters make the game feel more epic and break up the action nicely, but Hoth has been done to death already, and some of the sequences aren\'t as visceral as you might like. This is due largely to a stiff camera, something that occasionally hampers the action adventure levels as well. The camera usually stays in a fixed position, and though you\'re allowed a little wiggle room, there are a few specific points where it\'s easy to get stuck because the path is obscured.\n\n\n\nThere\'s no dedicated multiplayer component to Lego Star Wars II, though it does offer cooperative play, and at any point a second player can just jump right in. It works seamlessly and reduces the number of generally useless AI companions, but it\'s also disappointing that no version of Lego Star Wars II features online co-op. Whether you\'re playing alone or with a friend, Lego Star Wars II is easy. As long as you\'re pointing in the general direction, blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own, and death is barely punished with a small loss of money. It should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around, but there\'s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back.\n\n\n\nOnce you play through a level in the story mode, you can play it again in free play mode, which gives you some control over which characters you\'ll play as, and you\'ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn\'t get to with the story mode characters. You\'ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game, but there are others that you\'ll need to purchase in the shop, and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original Lego Star Wars, if it appeared on the system you\'re playing on. The free play mode also lets you use your own custom-made characters, which you can build using pieces of other playable characters. It doesn\'t effect the gameplay, but there\'s still something really funny about putting Darth Vader\'s head on Princess Leia\'s body when she\'s in her slave costume. Several different types of collectibles, an unlockable series of bounty hunter missions, and time trial mode all help to create some good lasting value.\n\n\n\nThough the game is appearing on no less than eight different platforms, most of these versions are virtually indistinguishable. Featurewise, the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PC versions of Lego Star Wars II are nearly identical, and the PSP version is awfully close, though it takes a slightly different approach to certain unlockables, and it also has much more pronounced loading times. The current-gen console versions all look slightly better than the original Lego Star Wars, while the PC version looks a bit better than those, since it can run at much higher resolutions. By default, the PC version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme, though it’s easily modified. There’s also gamepad support, and we found that a wired Xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons.\n\n\n\nThe character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations.\n\n\n\nThe Xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair, with better reflections, better explosions, and a cool lens-focus effect that makes objects too close to or too far from the camera appear slightly blurry. It\'s definitely the best-looking version, but it\'s also got a very minor frame rate problem that crops up when there are a lot of particle effects. The achievement points in the Xbox 360 version are pretty well balanced. You’ll probably get almost 200 points just by playing through all three episodes, though there is also a string of achievements that require you to complete entire chapters without dying once, which in some cases is no small feat.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the platform, though, the visuals have a ton of charm. Getting to see recognizable Lego pieces mingling with recognizable Star Wars characters and locales is just really endearing, and Lego Star Wars II does it quite well. A vast library of recognizable sound effects and that unshakably rousing John Williams score make the experience feel that much more authentic, and even though there\'s no real voice acting in the game, some miming and appropriate-sounding mumbles make it apparent what\'s going on.\n\n\n\nAs much fun as Lego Star Wars II is, it\'s unfortunate that it had to come second. Some of the novelty of the gameplay, as well as the concept itself, isn\'t quite as potent as it was the first time around. The original Star Wars trilogy just seems more deserving of this nostalgic treatment than the prequels. Still, anyone with even a sliver of nostalgia for Star Wars will find this to be a fun, good-natured romp.\n\n\n\nUpvote (2)\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nView Comments (0)\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nPlayStation 2\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\nFun use of both the <i>Star Wars</i> and Lego licenses\n\n\n\nSeamless co-op play\n\n\n\nLonger, more challenging than predecessor\n\n\n\nMore vehicle sequences give better variety\n\n\n\nLoads of unlockable content\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nCamera occasionally obscures the action\n\n\n\nNo online co-op\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\nAbout GameSpot\'s Reviews\n\n\n\nOther Platform Reviews for Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nDS /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nXbox 360 /\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nRyan Davis\n\n\n\nMore GameSpot Reviews\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA 2K19 Review - Another Year, Another Baller\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nShadow Of The Tomb Raider Review - Guerilla Girl\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nValkyria Chronicles 4 Review - Soar High\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA Live 19 Review -- Dribbling Forward\n\n\n\nLoad Comments (0)\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\n\n%gameName%\n\n\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\n\n\n\nYou\'re Good to Go!\n\n\n\nWe\'ll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n\nFirst Released\n\n\n\nSep 12, 2006\n\n\n\nreleased\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance\n\n\n\n+ 8 more\n\n\n\nGameCube\n\n\n\nMacintosh\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPlayStation 2\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy has you controlling LEGO versions of the original Star Wars heroes.\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\nAverage Rating\n\n\n\n10920 Rating(s)\n\n\n\nPlease\n\n\n\nSign In\n\n\n\nto rate\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nDeveloped by:\n\n\n\nAmaze Entertainment\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTraveller\'s Tales\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nRobosoft Technologies\n\n\n\nPublished by:\n\n\n\nLucasArts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nElectronic Arts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFeral Interactive\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTHQ Wireless\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nActivision\n\n\n\nGenre(s):\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nAdventure\n\n\n\nTheme(s):\n\n\n\nSci-Fi\n\n\n\nEveryone 10+ Cartoon Violence, Crude Humor\n\n\n\n© 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

Its gameplay—a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005). While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs – small, disk-shaped objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.



=== Playable characters ===



Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities.  This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the ""Use Old Save"" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data.Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley Cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible. Entering two cheat codes, publicized by IGN, makes pieces for a Santa Claus character available. The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used (for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name ""Darth-3PO""); alternately, the player may create a name.",Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars_II:_The_Original_Trilogy

 == playable characters == 



over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game , including variations of luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , chewbacca , lando calrissian , r2 - d2 , c - 3po , darth vader , wicket the ewok , and boba fett . character abilities have a greater role in lego star wars ii than in lego star wars . certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas . characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles , double jump and use the force . r2 - d2 , c - 3po , and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors . small characters like the ewok and jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas . bounty hunters , such as boba fett , may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects . sith , like darth vader , can use the force to manipulate black lego objects . some characters have unique abilities ; for example , chewbacca can rip enemies ' arms from their sockets , darth vader can choke enemies with the force , princess leia possesses a slap attack , and lando calrissian can use a kung - fu - like attack . special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets , and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities . this means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode . the player can unlock the "" use old save "" extra , which imports all unlocked characters from lego star wars for use in free play ; however , a lego star wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains lego star wars ii ' s save data . players can create two customized characters in the mos eisley cantina . these characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters ; 2 , 258 , 163 , 204 combinations are possible . entering two cheat codes , publicized by ign , makes pieces for a santa claus character available . the game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used ( for example , a character made from pieces of darth vader and c - 3po might have the name "" darth - 3po "" ) ; alternately , the player may create a name .",lego star wars ii : the original trilogy,"[""HTML\n\n\n\nVideo Game Reviews, Previews and News - myGamer\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nXBOX One\n\n\n\nSwitch\n\n\n\nPlaystation 4\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\nWii\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nVita\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n\nXBOX 360\n\n\n\nPlaystation 3\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\nnew\n\n\n\nMyGamer Visual Cast – Door Kickers: Action Squad (PC)\n\n\n\nPhantom Doctrine (PC) Review\n\n\n\nHamster releasing arcade Rygar and Aggressors of Dark Kombat this week\n\n\n\nNinjin: Clash of Carrots (Xbox One) Review\n\n\n\nNew trailer for Jake Hunter Detective Story: Ghost of the Dusk\n\n\n\nParty Arcade is the Switch sequel to the Wii’s Game Party\n\n\n\nTreasure Stack coming to Xbox One\n\n\n\nMoonlighter coming to Switch this November – trailer here\n\n\n\nDoor Kickers: Action Squad is sort of like a 2D Rainbow Six – Trailer here\n\n\n\nXbox titles on sale for the week of September 11, 2018\n\n\n\nV-Rally 4 Releases September 11th – launch trailer here\n\n\n\nNASCAR Heat 3 now racing on PS4, X1, and PC\n\n\n\nSNK HEROINES Tag Team Frenzy launch trailer here\n\n\n\nImmortal: Unchained now available on PS4, X1, and PC\n\n\n\nStarlink: Battle for Atlas: Gameplay Walkthrough video\n\n\n\nDetails on Jake Hunter Detective Story: Ghost of the Dusk 3DS\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nHamster releasing arcade Rygar and Aggressors of Dark Kombat this week New trailer for Jake Hunter Detective Story: Ghost of the Dusk Party Arcade is the Switch sequel to the Wii’s Game Party Treasure Stack coming to Xbox One Moonlighter coming to Switch this November – trailer here\n\n\n\nVIEW ALL\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nPhantom Doctrine (PC) Review Ninjin: Clash of Carrots (Xbox One) Review Earthworms (Switch) Review To Hell With Hell (PC) review with stream Blade Strangers (PS4) review with stream\n\n\n\nVIEW ALL\n\n\n\nVideocasts\n\n\n\nMyGamer Visual Cast – Door Kickers: Action Squad (PC) MyGamer Visual Cast – Ultimate Fishing Simulator 3DS Theme – Animal Crossing Falling Leaves via MyNintendo Mygamer Visual Cast – Touhou Luna Nights (PC) Kid Icarus – of Myths and Monsters (GB) full play-through\n\n\n\nVIEW ALL\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nN64 Classic Edition – Predictions, Wants, and Needs PSA: Final Call for Wii Shop Channel Purchases – Suggested Games Here You Know What Sucks… Collector Editions Need to be Better The Hunt For A SNES Classic is Already Out of Control How amiibo Helped Me Finish The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\n\n\n\nVIEW ALL\n\n\n\nArticles\n\n\n\n10 Games to Keep on your Radar for the 2018 Holiday Season MyGamer Is Hiring!!

Watching the three original Star Wars stories play out with characters and scenery composed of Lego bricks is a whimsical treat. But even beyond the charming Lego theme, it's a solidly designed action adventure game. The GBA version may not be as flashy or have as many features as its console counterparts do, but it still contains a healthy amount of the play variety that its so-called big brothers have. There's plenty of shooting and lightsaber swinging to do, the isometric levels lend themselves to exploration, and there are dozens of playable characters to unlock. There are even a few levels devoted to piloting such fan-favorite vehicles as the X-wing and Millennium Falcon. As a result, Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy has enough meat on its bones to please fans.\n\n\n\nScenes from the original Star Wars trilogy are rendered as Lego toys.\n\n\n\nYou've no doubt seen Star Wars -inspired Lego sets in the toy section of your local store. The whole idea behind Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy is that those sets are used to depict the events that took place in Star Wars , The Empire Strikes Back , and Return of the Jedi . In this game, the scenery and vehicles of the Star Wars universe look like they were put together using Lego bricks, at least to the extent that the GBA's limited horsepower allows. The characters all have rounded heads and squat bodies, just like actual Lego people do, and little details like connector studs and classic Lego pieces are evident at every turn. They've also incorporated the Lego brand into gameplay. When you blast a stormtrooper or various decorative objects, they break apart into individual Lego bricks and leave behind Lego studs, the valuable in-game currency. When you encounter an object that needs to be assembled, holding the R button will cause the individual bricks to join together right before your eyes. In all, there are 16 levels to explore, which can be played as part of a story mode or in a free play mode that lets you jockey between as many as 36 different playable characters.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay itself is standard for this type of game, but the variety of activities to do, coupled with the Star Wars subject matter and Lego-inspired nuances, prevents the gameplay from ever becoming too tedious. Roughly two-thirds of the game's levels take place on foot, where you have to track down captive friends while battling stormtroopers at every turn. The combat in these levels is fast paced, to the point that you'll find yourself constantly tapping the attack button to disintegrate the numerous sluggish stormtroopers that seem to be placed every few steps or so. Running out of health isn't a major problem, since you only lose a few Lego studs when you lose a life. You're given a rank at the end of each level based upon how many studs you collect, however, and there's a significant reward waiting for you once you collect the Jedi rank on every level. That should provide a good incentive to some people to stay alive for as long as possible, while also letting casual players get through the game as painlessly as possible.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the isometric environments are large and contain numerous secret rooms, some of which can only be visited by replaying the level with different characters in the free play mode. Although you can only control one character at a time, there are usually one or two other characters following you around that you can assume control of as the need arises. Different characters have unique abilities. Blaster characters, like Han Solo and Leia, can shoot enemies from a distance and assemble Lego bricks into useful objects. Jedi characters, such as Obi-Wan and Jedi Luke, must use their lightsaber weapons at close range, but they can jump higher than other characters and reflect the enemy's blaster shots back at them. They can also employ their force powers to shove enemies and to activate switches that non-Jedi can't. Some switches can only be activated by specific characters, such as R2-D2, C-3PO, and Lando Calrissian.\n\n\n\nCompared to the previous Lego Star Wars game, vehicle-oriented levels are more plentiful this time around. Nearly a third of the game's levels put players into the cockpit of familiar vehicles to re-create key action scenes from the films. There's the Death Star trench run, featuring Luke's X-wing; the Hoth Battle, with Luke at the controls of a snowspeeder; the asteroid belt escape, between the Millennium Falcon and hordes of TIE fighters; the Endor chase, with Han at the seat of an Imperial Speederbike; and the climactic Death Star battle, once again featuring the Millennium Falcon. The environments for these aerial battles use the same isometric perspective as the foot-based missions, but the emphasis is less about exploration and more about blasting any enemy ships that come your way. Fans of The Empire Strikes Back , in particular, will enjoy the Hoth Battle level, since a major portion of it involves snagging Imperial Walkers with the Snowspeeder's tow-hook and tying up their legs until they topple to the ground.\n\n\n\nThe game puts the GBA's limited audio-visual capabilities to good use. The isometric backgrounds are crisp, detailed, and vibrant. Character sprites are a good size. They're big enough so that you can tell who you're controlling, but not so big that they hog the screen. Fans will easily recognize the characters and environments, even though the characters resemble squat Lego people, and the scenery is decorated with Lego pieces and studs. Levels based on locations from the film, such as Tatooine, the Death Star, Hoth, and Endor, are unmistakable. There isn't much animation in the environments, aside from some flicking computer panels and steam jets, but the silky-smooth movement of the characters more than makes up for the lack of background vitality. Story scenes, which were depicted in the previous game as still close-ups, are depicted in this game by the in-game character sprites. The dialogue is represented by goofy caption boxes, and the characters pantomime their reactions with exaggerated arm and body movements. It's hilarious to watch. For the audio, the developer simply lifted the music and sound effects right from the movies. The familiar John Williams score sounds great coming out of the GBA's speakers, and all of the various blaster shots and droid chirps sound crystal clear.\n\n\n\nLevels encourage exploration, and there are 36 characters to choose from.\n\n\n\nThe only downside to the GBA version of Lego Star Wars II is that it isn't as thick with features as the console and PC versions of the game are. People that simply want to see the end of the story mode can do so in as little as two hours. Of course, the dozens of characters and secrets waiting to be discovered in the free play mode should provide sufficient incentive for most players to invest double or triple that amount of time to unlock everything the game has to offer. That's pretty much all there is to this specific version of the game, since the multiplayer modes and character editor from the other versions didn't make it into the GBA edition.\n\n\n\nThose that crave a portable Star Wars fix should be satisfied with the GBA version of LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. It may not be as slick or as meaty as its console counterparts, but it still manages to bring off the juxtaposition of Star Wars and LEGO with nearly the same level of irreverent charm, and it's a solid action adventure game besides.\n\n\n\nUpvote (3)\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nView Comments (0)\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nApple Keynote 2018: iPhone XR Price And Release Date Announced\n\n\n\nPS4's Spider-Man Adding A New Game Plus Mode\n\n\n\nApple Keynote 2018: iPhone XS / XS Max Release Date, Price Announced\n\n\n\nDelayed Nintendo Direct Presentation Gets A New Date\n\n\n\nApple Keynote 2018 Event News: iPhone XS, XS Max, XR; Apple Watch Series 4\n\n\n\nThe Best Gaming And Electronic Deals Available Now!\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\nIt's the original trilogy played out with Legos\n\n\n\ngreat use of music and sounds from the films\n\n\n\nexplorative levels and fast-paced combat\n\n\n\na wealth of playable characters\n\n\n\nnumerous secrets to unlock\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nCombat is repetitive at times\n\n\n\nstory mode can be finished in two hours\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\nAbout GameSpot's Reviews\n\n\n\nOther Platform Reviews for Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nDS /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nXbox 360 /\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nPSP /\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nFrank Provo\n\n\n\nMore GameSpot Reviews\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA 2K19 Review - Another Year, Another Baller\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nShadow Of The Tomb Raider Review - Guerilla Girl\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nValkyria Chronicles 4 Review - Soar High\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA Live 19 Review -- Dribbling Forward\n\n\n\nLoad Comments (0)\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\n\n%gameName%\n\n\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\n\n\n\nYou're Good to Go!\n\n\n\nWe'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n\nFirst Released\n\n\n\nSep 12, 2006\n\n\n\nreleased\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance\n\n\n\n+ 8 more\n\n\n\nGameCube\n\n\n\nMacintosh\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPlayStation 2\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy has you controlling LEGO versions of the original Star Wars heroes.\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\nAverage Rating\n\n\n\n10920 Rating(s)\n\n\n\nPlease\n\n\n\nSign In\n\n\n\nto rate\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nDeveloped by:\n\n\n\nAmaze Entertainment\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTraveller's Tales\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nRobosoft Technologies\n\n\n\nPublished by:\n\n\n\nLucasArts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nElectronic Arts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFeral Interactive\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTHQ Wireless\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nActivision\n\n\n\nGenre(s):\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nAdventure\n\n\n\nTheme(s):\n\n\n\nSci-Fi\n\n\n\nEveryone 10+ Cartoon Violence, Crude Humor\n\n\n\n© 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

Or should I say, the multiple truths that run through our gaming vernacular. One such truth is that sports games get yearly updates that change little more than roster. Another is that launch title games for new platforms tend to be very shallow tech demonstrations. There is even my own postulate as to the number of corporate logos before the title screen being directly correlated to the awfulness of the title. But the most often remembered and repeated is this: Licensed titles are heavily inclined to be terrible. Even if one can name several licensed titles that aren’t garbage, they are met with a mountainous preponderance of evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n\nBut a strange thing happens. What if there are two licenses being utilized at the same time? Is there a precedent for this? Yes, in fact, there is. The original Lego Star Wars somehow pulled a double negative. The two licenses fused to create something that is good, great, and what some would dare to describe as awesome. The negative stigma of the Star Wars license was in one way or another cancelled out by the negative stigma of another, equal license, that being Lego Toys.\n\n\n\nSo why does this game suck so badly? Well, for starters, I beat this entire game in approximately 38 minutes. That’s right, less than an hour. I’m not one of those guys who hammers on a game’s length like a harpy. (16 hours?! I paid three times the price of a movie for eight times the potential entertainment? RIPOFF!!) But 38 minutes is pushing it. What was the secret to my fantastic speed run? I ran forward and held the B button. That created an unstoppable column of laser right in front of me. All enemies were destroyed almost instantly. I had to let up on the B button occasionally, to build a bridge or open a door, or use the force, but my thumb was cemented to the B button the rest of the time.\n\n\n\nAfter I had beaten the entire game, I was informed by the opening menu screen that I had only completed 40% of the game. Are there perhaps… extra levels? No. Most of it is unlockable characters to play through the same levels again. These are purchased with Lego Studs that are found by randomly destroying things in the main game. And if it sounds useless, that is correct. After I stormed through the entire game, I really had no desire to replay each level with a different character, especially when the change is only cosmetic.\n\n\n\nAs for the miscellany, the graphics are somewhat grainy, and there is some hardcore slowdown in the later missions of Episode VI. The sound includes some tinny MIDI recreations of the most familiar film music of all time. The controls are effective, and by that I mean the control pad and the B button function correctly. But honestly, this entire game is just shallow and bad.\n\n\n\nSo why does it suck? It should be protected by the double negative of the two licenses. Ah, but the truth is that there is a third negative at work here., that being the console-game-ported-to-handheld negative. As far as I know, that is a Triple Negative.\n\n\n\nAnd since this article is about truths, I should dispense the real truths about the source material: Star Wars. Greedo shot first, complaints registered against the new trilogy can easily be levied with much more accuracy to the old one, the special editions improved the movies by leaps and bounds, the Ewok song is chiefly retarded, C-3PO is twice as annoying as Jar Jar Binks (and he’s in ALL SIX MOVIES), and Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson, and Samuel L. Jackson are the only actors to escape this entire series alive.

That last paragraph I wrote because Cinemax was doing this All weekend Star Wars marathon of every movie and when it got to that point when Greedo shot first I drove it into my brother\'s Star Wars nerd ear ""UNF, What now, UNF Greedo shoots first, official version, beoootch."" So I followed up with a mix of flamebait complaints and a mix of my own opinions (C-3PO is awfully annoying, and thanks to the new movies, he is a walking plot hole as well.) and I think I may have forgot that Ewan MacGregor appears to have left the series with somewhat of a career. I am actually somwhat saddened that I seem to only be funny when I am ripping a game a new orifice. I just can\'t seem to be humorous without insulting something, and if that is the case, am I really funny if I can\'t be humorous without the destruction of something else? I know I\'m getting into Insert_Credit levels of pretention here (see? I did it again!) but I am confident that I can make a funny review of a good game. It is my goal for the future.

While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs – small, disk-shaped objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.



=== Playable characters ===



Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities.  This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the ""Use Old Save"" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data.Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley Cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible. Entering two cheat codes, publicized by IGN, makes pieces for a Santa Claus character available. The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used (for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name ""Darth-3PO""); alternately, the player may create a name.",Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars_II:_The_Original_Trilogy

ups and other goodies .\', \'there is a lot of interactivity in the game , between characters as well as the environments . characters can literally be combined using the character customizer which will allow you to make your own star wars characters out of any of the existing characters’ body parts . how about chewleia or darth3po ? a plethora of objects constructed out of lego blocks can be smashed and reassembled into other objects such as stairs or ramps to help you gain access to a hard - to - reach area . in this game , as opposed to the first one , the vehicles that you build such as the tie fighters and star destroyer can actually be used .\', \'another player can join in anytime and instantly access the co - op mode . there is always another ai character with you and the player will assume the role of that particular character the instant he or she enters the game . that character can then be relegated back to the ai at anytime and the main player will not be affected at all by the change . this is a well thought - out system that will encourage multi - playing with even the most inexperienced of gamers . it’s unfortunate there isn’t an online mode but considering how much is offered in this title , one can’t really complain much .\', \'the production values are good but they aren’t great . there are some camera issues but you do have more control over it than with the first game . there are some framerate hiccups but overall it’s relatively smooth going . the characters look amazing and the stages are filled with detail and depth totally befitting the lego / star wars universe – which is basically composed of shiny , plastic , material . there aren’t any voiceovers but i hope you weren’t expecting this to be voiced by the original cast . the score is obviously composed by john williams and even though you’ve heard it before , there’s nothing else that could be more fitting , save perhaps the entire orchestration performed through a shiny , plastic , casio keyboard .\', \'in a nutshell , lego star wars ii is action , adventure , collecting , puzzles , races , mini - game , co - op mode and your favorite star wars characters all having a great time . all you need is a copy of this game to join in on the fun . highly recommended for players of all ages .\', \'relive the fun in a whole new way ! the game that lets you combine the fun of lego with all the action and excitement of star wars now lets you battle through all your favorite moments in the original star wars trilogy ( episodes iv , v and vi ) .\', \'from luke and princess leia to han solo and darth vader , now play over 50 of your favorite characters in a humorous and unique lego setting .\', \'build and customize with a galaxy of new features . for the first time ever , you can build and ride new vehicles and creatures and get in and out to explore the world of the original star wars trilogy . create and customize new characters with new abilities . with even more destructible environments and more challenging puzzles , playing lego star wars has never been more fun .\', \'play with your buddies . the drop -

must buy not an average . see rating legend above for a final score breakdown .\', \'in the history of "" ideas so crazy they just might work "" , the lego star wars video games stand as the shining example . by patrick evans\', \'growing up , legos are toys that spark children’s imagination . from the simple building blocks of a house to the multi - colored “planks” of a pirate ship or a square , boxy build of a race car , the only limitation to what you can build is the imagination . so when last year , lucasarts reached into our childhoods with their retelling of episodes one through three in lego star wars . answering the calls of countless fans , myself included , lucasarts will now retell the original trilogy in lego star wars ii : the original trilogy .\', \'starring the cast of the original trilogy , lego star wars ii will refine the formula set by its predecessor in providing fun adventure gameplay and combat while remaining fairly accessible to casual gamers . one of the most important adjustments to the “ease” in gameplay will be the adjustable difficulty . if , throughout a level perhaps , you are getting your rear handed to you by various storm troopers and the like , the game will adjust its difficulty down to allow players to continue making progress through the game instead of giving up in frustration . on the other hand , if you are slaughtering everything you come across without so much as a ding , which may have been the case for some players of the original , then the difficulty will ratchet upwards to keep play interesting .\', \'lego star wars allowed players to play as their favorite characters throughout the game and unlock countless goodies , but the original trilogy will go one better by allowing players to customize their character with interchangeable parts . that’s right , you can have the head of princess leia on the body of han solo carrying a light - saber while donning darth vader’s black cape . lucasarts will be rewarding owners of the original by using their save files to unlock the original unlockable characters . including the original characters , over 100 characters will be accessible in the original trilogy , including luke , lando , greedo , and every other memorable character imaginable .\', \'the customization doesn’t end there either . like in the original , players will construct different vehicles throughout the game to accomplish goals and clear levels . this time around , however , all non - droid characters will be able to construct vehicles from parts strewn across the stage . these pieces will be found behind obstacles and whatnot , requiring various character skills to access . additionally , hidden model kit pieces will be hidden in each of the levels throughout the trilogy , allowing you to use custom vehicles , which aren’t found by default in game , through specific stages .\', \'character specific combat and moves will be expanded upon , making the difference between playing as han solo and chewbacca two completely different gameplay experiences . while vader may be able to use a force choke - hold to defeat opponents , chewbacca will be adept at ripping the lego arms off of stormtroopers . as stated above , various characters will be able to solve specific puzzles as well . chewbacca’s brute strength would be useless in a specific stage , for instance , where luke’s force abilities would be required .\', \'these improvements and more , such as bigger level designs and a more competent camera system , will ensure that fans of the original will be more than satisfied by the lego telling of episodes four through six . look for the lego pieces to start flying late this summer .\', ""steam now selling uncensored adult games pubg drops to under one million players nintendo announces nintendo switch pokemon bundles breaking down the best of sony’s pre -

solving and the occasional platform - jumping . the size of your group expands and contracts regularly , growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times . you control only one character at a time , and you can switch characters easily on the fly . your artificial intelligence - controlled companions are pretty worthless , save for a few specific scripted sequences . there \' s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters , which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed . usually , though , the characters you \' re dragging around are there for a reason , as there are several different classes of characters , each with unique abilities that you \' ll need to progress . jedi characters sport lightsabers , can perform double - jumps , and can use their force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment . regular hero characters like princess leia and han solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot . c3po and r2d2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment , and r2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances . short characters like jawas and ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas ."", ""these character classes were all in the original , though they \' ve been tweaked slightly . all nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of legos into usable devices , something that originally only jedi were capable of ; many blaster - wielding characters will now auto - dodge incoming blaster fire ; and most characters now have unique melee attacks - - it \' s great to watch chewie rip a stormtrooper \' s arms right out of their sockets or to see lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were ryu . not only do all these refinements make non - jedi characters more useful , they also lend the game a bit more personality . new to lego star wars ii are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters . since you \' ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode , you \' ll have to rely on special helmet machines , which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter . it \' s a fragile ruse , though , because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off . the bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators , which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects ."", ""lego star wars ii puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original . you \' ll happen upon small carts , landspeeders , and at - sts that you can pilot in the action adventure chapters , though there are also chapters dedicated to memorable sequences like destroying both of the death stars , fighting off imperial forces in your snowspeeder on hoth , and racing speeder bikes through the forests of endor . these dedicated vehicle chapters make the game feel more epic and break up the action nicely , but hoth has been done to death already , and some of the sequences aren \' t as visceral as you might like . this is due largely to a stiff camera , something that occasionally hampers the action adventure levels as well . the camera usually stays in a fixed position , and though you \' re allowed a little wiggle room , there are a few specific points where it \' s easy to get stuck because the path is obscured ."", ""there \' s no dedicated multiplayer component to lego star wars ii , though it does offer cooperative play , and at any point a second player can just jump right in . it works seamlessly and reduces the number of generally useless ai companions , but it \' s also disappointing that no version of lego star wars ii features online co - op . whether you \' re playing alone or with a friend , lego star wars ii is easy . as long as you \' re pointing in the general direction , blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own , and death is barely punished with a small loss of money . it should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around , but there \' s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back ."", ""once you play through a level in the story mode , you can play it again in free play mode , which gives you some control over which characters you \' ll play as , and you \' ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn \' t get to with the story mode characters . you \' ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game , but there are others that you \' ll need to purchase in the shop , and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original lego star wars , if it appeared on the system you \' re playing on . the free play mode also lets you use your own custom -

gen console versions all look slightly better than the original lego star wars , while the pc version looks a bit better than those , since it can run at much higher resolutions . by default , the pc version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme , though it’s easily modified . there’s also gamepad support , and we found that a wired xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons .\', \'the character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations .\', ""the xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair , with better reflections , better explosions , and a cool lens -

roaming as opposed to set on rails , yet the vehicles still move forward on their own and the levels are mostly linear . these missions are confusing , have weird objectives , and are simply not as fun as the original \' s vehicle missions . the one exception to this is the excellent on - rails speeder bike mission on the moon of endor . otherwise , consider the uninteresting gameplay of the original lsw not fixed here , indeed broken twice over ."", ""there are a few additions to gameplay that appear to spruce things up a bit . most characters have a close range attack when next to an enemy and their purpose is mostly humor : chewbacca rips off the arms of enemy combatants ( an action discussed but never seen in star wars ) , while leia , there \' s no other way to say this , bitch - slaps them . also , some blaster characters can dodge laser fire if you stand still during a firefight , and blaster characters can now build objects out of broken legos in context appropriate situations . there is also a mode to create your own lego character out of lego pieces and use him or her ( or it ) in the game . all of these additions are either aesthetic or tangential and alter the game very little ."", ""the graphics of the game should receive high marks , again not for detail or complexity but for simple comic beauty . the worlds are much larger and rendered even better this time around , while the cinema scenes reach a pixar - esque level of humor within their short length . i do think there was more to make fun of in the first three episodes of star wars than in this trilogy , but the developers have still made the short level intros and outros fun to watch if you \' re familiar with the movies . the sound , on the other hand , is just as sadly utilitarian as before – the music is lifted directly from the films and played on a loop . the sound effects are also accurately recreated making lswii \' s audio authentic , if predictable ."", ""if the game can be saved , it is through its cooperative mode – there really is no other way to play this game , especially now that the levels are larger and the objectives require more teamwork . although the camera is still mostly unmovable and too rigid for two players to share , the game \' s emphasis on humor and nostalgia make co -

person perspective , and takes place in a 3d game world that contains objects , environments and characters designed to resemble lego pieces . its gameplay—a combination of the action - adventure , platform , and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of lego star wars : the video game ( 2005 ) . while lego star wars followed the events of the phantom menace ( 1999 ) , attack of the clones ( 2002 ) , and revenge of the sith ( 2005 ) , lego star wars ii is based on star wars ( 1977 ) , the empire strikes back ( 1980 ) , and return of the jedi ( 1983 ) . the game comically retells the trilogy ' s events using cutscenes without dialogue . the player assumes the roles of the films ' characters , each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities . at any time , a second player can join the game , by activating a second controller . during gameplay , players can collect lego studs – small , disk - shaped objects , that serve as the game ' s currency . the player has a health meter , which is displayed on the game ' s heads - up display . the player ' s health is represented by four hearts ; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away . however , they instantly respawn and can often re - collect the lost studs . the game ' s central location is the mos eisley cantina , a spaceport bar on the planet tatooine . at the counter , the player may use their lego studs to purchase characters , vehicles , gameplay hints and extras , or activate cheat codes . in a small area outside the cantina , players may view collected vehicles . the game is broken into levels , which are accessed from the cantina ; each film is represented by six levels , representing key locations and scenes in that film . the locations include hoth , bespin , dagobah , tatooine , the death star , and endor . the game also features bonus levels . during levels , the player defeats enemies , builds objects out of lego bricks and drives vehicles , certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles , including a tie fighter , a snowspeeder , and the millennium falcon . levels must first be played in story mode . this unlocks the next level as well as a free play mode for the recently completed level . gameplay is identical in the two modes . however , story mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on , while free play offers all those unlocked . levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items . three types of secret items are available : gold bricks , minikits , and power bricks . within each level is hidden one power brick . when a power brick is collected , its corresponding extra , such as invincibility or stud multipliers , becomes available for purchase . each level also contains ten hidden minikits , that is , ten pieces of a star wars vehicle . when all ten have been collected , the player is awarded a gold brick . collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards , such as a spigot that spews out studs . gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed , and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level ; ninety - nine gold bricks are available . the vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina . as each vehicle is completed ( all ten minikits collected ) , it becomes available for play in a bonus level .



 == playable characters == 



over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game , including variations of luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , chewbacca , lando calrissian , r2 - d2 , c - 3po , darth vader , wicket the ewok , and boba fett . character abilities have a greater role in lego star wars ii than in lego star wars . certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas . characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles , double jump and use the force . r2 - d2 , c - 3po , and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors . small characters like the ewok and jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas . bounty hunters , such as boba fett , may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects . sith , like darth vader , can use the force to manipulate black lego objects . some characters have unique abilities ; for example , chewbacca can rip enemies ' arms from their sockets , darth vader can choke enemies with the force , princess leia possesses a slap attack , and lando calrissian can use a kung - fu - like attack . special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets , and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities . this means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode . the player can unlock the "" use old save "" extra , which imports all unlocked characters from lego star wars for use in free play ; however , a lego star wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains lego star wars ii ' s save data . players can create two customized characters in the mos eisley cantina . these characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters ; 2 , 258 , 163 , 204 combinations are possible . entering two cheat codes , publicized by ign , makes pieces for a santa claus character available . the game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used ( for example , a character made from pieces of darth vader and c - 3po might have the name "" darth - 3po "" ) ; alternately , the player may create a name .",lego star wars ii : the original trilogy,"[""html\n\n\n\nHome Page – The TLS\n\n\n\nThe times Literary supplement\n\n\n\nThe leading international weekly for literary culture\n\n\n\nLogout\n\n\n\nSubscribe Login\n\n\n\nLatest Edition\n\n\n\nSubjects\n\n\n\nMary Beard\n\n\n\nDaily\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nSearch:\n\n\n\nSearch by author, title, reviewer or keyword\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nThis week's TLS\n\n\n\nSeptember 14, 2018\n\n\n\nAlcohol and art; David Foster Wallace’s worst friend; the purpose of biography; asking a philosopher for advice; stories of Bruce Lee; how China became a twenty-first-century nation; gentleman publishers – and much more\n\n\n\nView edition\n\n\n\nIn next week's TLS\n\n\n\nOUT\n\n\n\n21 Sep 2018\n\n\n\nPHILIP HORNE\n\n\n\nHenry James in LA\n\n\n\nSUSAN IRVINE\n\n\n\nHow to read an Anglo-Saxon poem\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\n\nHow to advertise\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\n\nCopyright © The Times Literary Supplement Limited 2018.

Eighteen wheels are your weapon to clear your path of pesky police and badass bikers. Steer your rig through icy slopes, desert drives, and neon illuminated cities as you visit hotspots like Smokestack Heights or Skeeter\'s Creek.\n\n\n\nWhile touring the country side, you and your three siblings are involved in a ""Trial by Truck\'n."" Ma\'s sick of the ol\' hauling business, so she\'s retiring. She can\'t pick which of her charming offspring is qualified to take over ""Big Mutha Truckers,"" her trucking company, so whoever can make the most money in sixty days (so that she has a nice wad o\' cash to retire with) gets the business. It\'s up to you to use you business smarts and your sharp reflexes to show Ma who really is her favorite child.\n\n\n\nGameplay\n\n\n\nBig Mutha Truckers is 2/3 arcade trucking and 1/3 economic simulation. Anyone who has played Palm Pilot games like Space Trader or Drug Wars knows the supply and demand style gameplay you can expect to find in BMT . The difference is that not only is BMT in 3D, but you actually get to drive to your destination.\n\n\n\nYour first order of business is to pick out which of the four Jacksons you can tolerate. There isn\'t really a difference in tuck handling, so this decision is purely based on whose style you like the most. There\'s the skimpily clad Bobbie-Sue, who adorns her truck with huge kisses and has a teddy bear tied to the radiator. Cletus is the typical redneck, complete with missing teeth, ratty clothing, and a big ol\' trucker\'s cap. Earl is the oldest of the group, and his size shows it as he rocks his rig upon entry. Rawkus is the smooth talk\'n ladies man, who looks more like a Hollywood cowboy than a redneck hick.\n\n\n\nOnce you\'ve found your Jackson, you have to choose between Trial by Truck\'n or Mission Mode. Trial by Truck\'n is the main game mode where you must outhaul your kin so that you can be heir to Big Mutha Truckers, Inc. You start off at BMT, Inc. with a truck full of booze and a destination picked out by Ma.\n\n\n\nWhen you finally pull out of BMT, you\'ll get your first taste of eighteen wheeler driving. Surprisingly, you\'ll find the physics seem fairly realistic. Cars don\'t automatically go flying into the air or blow up in a cloud of flames when you hit them (that takes several hits). Instead, most of them crunch up or are thrown into spins for short distances. Your trailer also behaves as you\'d expect. Any sudden movements cause the trailer to swing across lanes. Depending on the angle of your turns you can spin out and are forced to weave back and forth across the entire road as you attempt to regain control. Backing up is also slow and it\'s not easy to navigate. This might not qualify as a realistic simulation of big rig driving, but it replicates what you\'d imagine truck driving to be like.\n\n\n\nBesides for keeping your truck under control, while you\'re on the road you need only worry about four things, fuel, damage, police, and truck jackers. Your truck guzzles gas like a Hummer forced to drive up California Street in San Francisco. If you run out of gas on the road, you have to pay a fine to get towed back to your point of origin and you lose a day of travel.\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nNext »\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\nGame of Thrones, Westworld and Every Other Winner from the 2018 Emmys\n\n\n\niOS 12 Is Out, Here Are the Coolest New Features\n\n\n\nGeorge R.

Yes, the game lampoons the classic cinematic series but in the process it creates an alternate but independent Star Wars universe based on LEGO models which are based on the original Star Wars characters. This game has single handedly broken two cultural barriers: Star Wars isn’t just for nerds, and LEGO isn’t just for kids.\n\n\n\nAmazingly LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy follows the events of the first three Star Wars movies – in other words, the good ones. Liberties are taken with the plot but that’s all part of the fun. The Story mode does a great job of keeping characters and events in chronological order. All of your favorite Star Wars characters are featured in this game including Luke, Obi, Hans, the Princess, Chewy, R2, C3PO and Darth Vader. If you played the first LEGO Star Wars game you’ll be able to import your favorite characters from that game into this one. Each character has unique powers which will come in handy for different situations. While the gameplay is rather simple, there are tons of unlockables to find which creates its own kind of challenge. You will have to scour the levels from top to bottom to find these goodies which include everything from new characters to new modes. The only way that you can access all of the areas in each level is to exploit the different characters’ abilities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nThe Shame of Your Gaming Backlog\n\n\n\nThe Endless Tragedy of Digital Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nIs The Division Afraid to Get Political?\n\n\n\nIs Gaming Addiction a Thing (And Why We Can’t Decide)\n\n\n\nWhy You Might Be a Game Glitch Snob\n\n\n\nHow Gaming Ruins Relationships (And Why It Should Stop)\n\n\n\nWhy Video Game Secrets Matter\n\n\n\nCan Non-Fans Enjoy Sports Games?\n\n\n\nLet\'s Trade Microtransactions for Unlockables\n\n\n\nThis Sequel Will Send You into a RAGE!\n\n\n\nWhere Should Nintendo’s Classics Go Next?\n\n\n\nHow Fortnite Became #1 (and PUBG Didn\'t)\n\n\n\nWhy Deadpool Is F%#king Awesomesauce\n\n\n\nWhy PUBG Is Screwing up Big Time\n\n\n\nHow Video Games Can Get You Arrested\n\n\n\nMore Special Features...\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nLuke and Obi have the Force on their side. With it they can move LEGO objects that would otherwise be immovable. They are also equipped with lightsabers which not only take care of enemies quite nicely but can also be used to foil laser traps which will get them into inaccessible areas. When it comes to ranged combat, Hans Solo and Princess Leia use laser blasters to take out the enemy from a relatively safe distance. They are also equipped with grappling hooks so that they can climb walls and get to higher regions. To get through locked doors you will need the skills of the droids. This is where R2 and C3PO earn their keep. They can hack into computer networks and retrieve access codes to open sealed doors. With his attached rockets, R2D2 has the added ability to propel himself across wide expanses. Being evil has its benefits as well. The dark Sith lord, Darth Vader also has the Force at his command and can also move various LEGO blocks and objects. In fact there are certain ones that can only be moved by those who have joined the dark side. All of these different powers will allow you to seek out hidden treasures located throughout each level. You may just want to tackle the Story mode first and come back for the collectibles later. Regardless of how you pace yourself there is always plenty of things to do in this game.\n\n\n\nAside from the main Story mode, there is a Free Mode which lets you play as any character in any level that you’ve previously unlocked. This is why it may be to your benefit to complete the Story mode first so that you can go back as any character to search for the unlockables. The Super Story mode is a race against time. You have one hour to get through one of the three movie episode levels. You won’t have any time to waste so you’ll just have to push through it. If you manage to accomplish this task you’ll be rewarded with gold bricks which you can use to unlock even more levels. In the bonus rounds you will be able to collect LEGO studs, a million of them to be exact. These studs are used like money. With them you can purchase weapons, power-ups and other goodies.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of interactivity in the game, between characters as well as the environments. Characters can literally be combined using the Character Customizer which will allow you to make your own Star Wars characters out of any of the existing characters’ body parts. How about ChewLeia or Darth3PO? A plethora of objects constructed out of LEGO blocks can be smashed and reassembled into other objects such as stairs or ramps to help you gain access to a hard-to-reach area. In this game, as opposed to the first one, the vehicles that you build such as the Tie Fighters and Star Destroyer can actually be used.\n\n\n\nAnother player can join in anytime and instantly access the Co-op mode. There is always another AI character with you and the player will assume the role of that particular character the instant he or she enters the game. That character can then be relegated back to the AI at anytime and the main player will not be affected at all by the change. This is a well thought-out system that will encourage multi-playing with even the most inexperienced of gamers. It’s unfortunate there isn’t an online mode but considering how much is offered in this title, one can’t really complain much.\n\n\n\nThe production values are good but they aren’t great. There are some camera issues but you do have more control over it than with the first game. There are some framerate hiccups but overall it’s relatively smooth going. The characters look amazing and the stages are filled with detail and depth totally befitting the LEGO/Star Wars universe – which is basically composed of shiny, plastic, material. There aren’t any voiceovers but I hope you weren’t expecting this to be voiced by the original cast. The score is obviously composed by John Williams and even though you’ve heard it before, there’s nothing else that could be more fitting, save perhaps the entire orchestration performed through a shiny, plastic, Casio keyboard.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, LEGO Star Wars II is action, adventure, collecting, puzzles, races, mini-game, Co-op mode and your favorite Star Wars characters all having a great time. All you need is a copy of this game to join in on the fun. Highly recommended for players of all ages.\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n\nRelive the Fun in a Whole New Way! The game that lets you combine the fun of LEGO with all the action and excitement of Star Wars now lets you battle through all your favorite moments in the Original Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI).\n\n\n\nFrom Luke and Princess Leia to Han Solo and Darth Vader, now play over 50 of your favorite characters in a humorous and unique LEGO setting.\n\n\n\nBuild and Customize with a Galaxy of New Features.

From the simple building blocks of a house to the multi-colored “planks” of a pirate ship or a square, boxy build of a race car, the only limitation to what you can build is the imagination. So when last year, LucasArts reached into our childhoods with their retelling of Episodes One through Three in LEGO Star Wars. Answering the calls of countless fans, myself included, LucasArts will now retell the original trilogy in LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy.\n\n\n\nStarring the cast of the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II will refine the formula set by its predecessor in providing fun adventure gameplay and combat while remaining fairly accessible to casual gamers. One of the most important adjustments to the “ease” in gameplay will be the adjustable difficulty. If, throughout a level perhaps, you are getting your rear handed to you by various storm troopers and the like, the game will adjust its difficulty down to allow players to continue making progress through the game instead of giving up in frustration. On the other hand, if you are slaughtering everything you come across without so much as a ding, which may have been the case for some players of the original, then the difficulty will ratchet upwards to keep play interesting.\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars allowed players to play as their favorite characters throughout the game and unlock countless goodies, but The Original Trilogy will go one better by allowing players to customize their character with interchangeable parts. That’s right, you can have the head of Princess Leia on the body of Han Solo carrying a light-saber while donning Darth Vader’s black cape. LucasArts will be rewarding owners of the original by using their save files to unlock the original unlockable characters. Including the original characters, over 100 characters will be accessible in The Original Trilogy, including Luke, Lando, Greedo, and every other memorable character imaginable.\n\n\n\nThe customization doesn’t end there either. Like in the original, players will construct different vehicles throughout the game to accomplish goals and clear levels. This time around, however, all non-droid characters will be able to construct vehicles from parts strewn across the stage. These pieces will be found behind obstacles and whatnot, requiring various character skills to access. Additionally, hidden model kit pieces will be hidden in each of the levels throughout the trilogy, allowing you to use custom vehicles, which aren’t found by default in game, through specific stages.\n\n\n\nCharacter specific combat and moves will be expanded upon, making the difference between playing as Han Solo and Chewbacca two completely different gameplay experiences. While Vader may be able to use a Force Choke-Hold to defeat opponents, Chewbacca will be adept at ripping the LEGO arms off of stormtroopers. As stated above, various characters will be able to solve specific puzzles as well. Chewbacca’s brute strength would be useless in a specific stage, for instance, where Luke’s force abilities would be required.\n\n\n\nThese improvements and more, such as bigger level designs and a more competent camera system, will ensure that fans of the original will be more than satisfied by the LEGO telling of Episodes four through six.

If you\'ve ever wanted to experience running through a corrupt city taking out the trash one punch at a time, now is your chance. Step into the shoes of one of five brash fighting machines in Las Sombras.\n\n\n\nThe Game\n\n\n\nBeat Down: Fists of Vengeance is the newest attempt to put the beat em\' up genre back on top like it was back in the late 80s, early 90s with Streets of Rage and Double Dragon. Of course Beat Down leaps past these two in gaming ideas and presentation, but one area where it couldn\'t make the jump is in gameplay. It\'s the real reason any game works and unfortunately hardcore fighting fans will immediately notice it\'s the weakest area of Beat Down.\n\n\n\nEven though the fighting system drags the game down I was intrigued by the story. I know the plot has the cheese, it\'s the standard revenge story from any action movie, but it had me! It could be the style or maybe I just needed to have my fun kicking someone\'s teeth in. Beat Down\'s plot goes like this. Your character worked for the Zanetti Cartel until you got set up for murder and being a traitor to the family. You\'re on the run from the law and the underground scum in the Zanetti gang are after you. Finding salvation in a local watering whole called ""The Hole"", you gather your resources and go out to lay the Beat Down and get Vengeance. Basically you beat people senseless, no side perks, or damsel in distress.\n\n\n\nThe character you play is up to you, Beat Down features five main characters. First on the block is the slick hair ""Raven"". Raven reminds me of\n\n\n\nGavin Rossdale\n\n\n\nof Bush, or\n\n\n\nGwen Stefanie\n\n\n\nfame. Raven was the character I used on my first play through. Then we have ""The Big G"" Jason G. He is the obligatory big guy in the game. ""The Dark Horse"" Gina is the third character. Her character has the famous X-Stripper turned assassin background. She is quick and a good character to use starting off. Lola ""Target Eliminator"" is next on the list. This gal is not a stripper, but a expect in guerrilla warfare. What\'s after the mercs? well the mob of course! Lastly the game has Aaron ""Drug Lords Love Child"". ouch... say that with a straight face! Aaron is Zanetti\'s son and that doesn\'t help his chances here. Aaron with his triple punch and kick moves is a good candidate to easily score some points. There are more then the main characters to fight with in the game, so even if you get bored with these there is more variety once you get rolling.\n\n\n\nYou navigate in the game by running, or driving a stolen car to a few different sections on the Las Sombras map. It seems really cool at first to do all the traveling, but it slowly becomes a pain. You\'ll know what I mean when you in the mission protecting your friends. I\'m not sure if I prefer the free roam system in Beat Down or being let through a game like most other beat em\' up games. If you\'re not doing the main storyline mission you can also acquire side missions from the bartender. These missions are a plenty and are the only real way to make big bucks. This part adds a lot to the game and I found myself jumping between a story mission and a side bet. I\'d half to say most of these side missions are more amusing then the main mission, minus the story.\n\n\n\nBeat Down is a mature title and you\'ll know it right of the bat. These dudes swear up a storm, the story deals with death and drugs and then you end up walking around as a bruised and beaten meat bag. There is an option to turn off the character bruising, but that would spoil half the fun. Beat Down wouldn\'t be the same with the violence turned down.\n\n\n\nEven though these are not the greatest examples Beat Down reminds me of \'Narc\' and \'Fight Club,\' two bad games which could have been cooler. Although there is way more then game ideas then fighting which I will cover more in the innovative section. Capcom could have had a contender with all these ideas in the hat, but like I mentioned earlier the gameplay pulled this one down. Beat Down was fun for me; it\'s too bad it wasn\'t polished up a little more.\n\n\n\nGraphics & Sound\n\n\n\nBeat Down is more stylish then graphically impressive. The game keeps the tones turned towards the grays, but also adds a lot of urban style to the characters. The atmosphere is a little forced at times, but it works as a whole. The character models are the highlight compared to the average environments. Closely resembling Def Jam, the characters are customizable, and have that big, overly tough look to them. The game does a great job adding in bruises and blood on the characters if they get pummeled in a fight, it\'s a nice touch and has been developed well in Beat Down. The graphics run at a steady frame rate and have no lag which might be attributed to frequent loading screens.\n\n\n\nThe sound in the game performs below the graphics and suffers from overused one liners. I really wished they would have varied the one-liners after a fight, or taken them out all together. Besides that the voice acting is weak, but it works with the cheese factor of the story. I liked Raven\'s British accent, even though I heard ""wanker"" and ""shite"" a thousand times. The music is low-key bass and drum alternative type deal which was grooving for a while, but then it gets old. just like the voice acting.\n\n\n\nInnovation\n\n\n\nAmbition runs through the code of Beat Down: Fists of Vengeance. Although I know some people might not agree, this game has an innovative spark. The ideas might be borrowed in some areas, but for the most part they tried to make the most of some neat ideas. The first idea which really struck me was the Negotiation System. Negotiation with another character can take place in battle and in normal conversation on the street. During battle you have to ware down their pride before you can successfully negotiate with them. The negotiation menu has the following selections recruit, rob, interrogate, and beatdown (in battle only). The recruit is the coolest feature which adds the new character to your blacklist and can be called up to join your gang. In different missions you\'ll be required to use the negotiation system a fair amount.\n\n\n\nAnother interesting feature in Beat Down is your wanted level which is indicated at the top of the screen. There are two levels one for the Zanetti gang and the other for the police. If you change up your look often you will have a better chance to remain unnoticeable to each faction. When the level hits 100% you will have to enter combat when passing by a member of the police or Zanetti gang. It\'s a pretty cool idea in a fighting game, but the system could have utilized better and honestly I didn\'t find much use for it unless a mission specifies a certain outfit, or avoiding people.\n\n\n\nHaving a gang up to three other characters is another cool feature in Beat Down. You get these characters by default, or recruiting them. Each character has different traits like Pickpocket or Car Thief which are used to steal in the game. The NPC\'s are all at different experience levels which increase during the game and have varied fighting styles. When you\'re in a VS. fight it becomes important to have backup because when you\'re defeated they can step in.\n\n\n\nSome other features which added to Beat Down are the multiple endings, ability to change your look with plastic surgery or all the clothing options. They also have a neat feature where you suffer trauma if you loose a fight. To gain your wits back, you have to visit the hospital, or defeat the person who caused you the pain. Beat Down: Fists of Vengeance has some great ideas for a fighting game, and hopefully some of Beat Down features will be revamped and used in Capcom games in the feature.\n\n\n\nMojo\n\n\n\nThe mojo vibes rides the subway down to the streets of vengeance. Streets has a cool atmosphere, a interesting cast, and some fun beat em\' up action. I really dug how the pulled away the restrictions gave us an environment free to beat down anyone we want. I actually liked the characters and their one liners, like\n\n\n\nRaven\'s ""You\'ll always be a wanker!"" All you need to do is let go of your expectations and you will flow with Beat Down\'s mojo.\n\n\n\nLowdown\n\n\n\nBeat Down: Fists of Vengeance comes out swinging and ends up a little short. The games attempt at innovating the beat em\' up genre is applauded, but in the last round it\'s the iffy controls that push this into the rent category. Test it out and see if you\'re digging the beat down vibe.\n\n\n\nGameplay:\n\n\n\n7,\n\n\n\nGraphics/Sound:\n\n\n\n6,\n\n\n\nInnovation:\n\n\n\n8,\n\n\n\nMojo:\n\n\n\n7.\n\n\n\nFinal:\n\n\n\n7 /10\n\n\n\nReviewed by Downtown Jimmy | Sept. 13th 2005\n\n\n\nBeat Down: Fists of Vengeance\n\n\n\nPublisher\n\n\n\nCapcom\n\n\n\nDeveloper\n\n\n\nCapcom\n\n\n\nGenre\n\n\n\nBeat Em\' Up\n\n\n\nReleased\n\n\n\nAug. 2005\n\n\n\nESRB\n\n\n\nMature\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\nCapcom\n\n\n\nHome :: News :: Reviews :: Features :: Forum :: Info :: Extreme Gamer 2003-2013©', 'html\n\n\n\nGameTrailers - YouTube\n\n\n\nSkip navigation\n\n\n\nCH\n\n\n\nSign in\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nGameTrailers\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nPlaylists\n\n\n\nCommunity\n\n\n\nChannels\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nBest of YouTube\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\nMovies\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nLive\n\n\n\n360° Video\n\n\n\nBrowse channels\n\n\n\nSign in now to see your channels and recommendations!\n\n\n\nSign in\n\n\n\nWatch Queue\n\n\n\nQueue\n\n\n\nWatch Queue\n\n\n\nQueue\n\n\n\nRemove all\n\n\n\nDisconnect\n\n\n\nThe next video is starting\n\n\n\nstop\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\nWatch Queue\n\n\n\nQueue\n\n\n\n__count__/__total__\n\n\n\nGameTrailers.com\n\n\n\nGameTrailers\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nSubscribed\n\n\n\nUnsubscribe\n\n\n\n741,483\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\nWorking...\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nPlaylists\n\n\n\nCommunity\n\n\n\nChannels\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nEverything Gamescom 2018\n\n\n\nPlay all\n\n\n\n0:31\n\n\n\nPlay next\n\n\n\nPlay now\n\n\n\nDestiny 2: Forsaken - Gambit Free Trial Trailer\n\n\n\n- Duration: 31 seconds.\n\n\n\nGameTrailers\n\n\n\n2 weeks ago\n\n\n\n4,440 views\n\n\n\nGambit, the new hybrid PVE/PVP mode, will be free to all Destiny 2 players for 24 hours on September 1.

It\'s brash, violent and might make some gamers outright blanche.\n\n\n\nContinuing in the once hallowed tradition of the beat-em-up genre, Beat Down will appeal to those who wonder why Final Fight & Double Dragon just aren\'t popular these days. Ironically or at least conveniently, Beat Down provides the answer to that rhetorical question. No matter how much makeup you throw on an aging actress, the wrinkles will manage to slice through the facade, revealing the cracked foundation lying beneath the surface. In an attempt to appeal to todays generation by tossing in unecessary bells and whistles that aren\'t welcome in the genre, Beat Down comes off as a convoluted mish mash of concepts wrapped in an angry blanket of life-siphoning load times. And that my friends, is the long view.\n\n\n\nOne aspect the Xbox generation will enjoy thoroughly is the mind-numbing violence that permeates almost every playing moment. Beat Down is one of the more violent offerings I\'ve played in recent memory. As one of five available characters, you\'ll make your way through the mean streets, stopping every step of the way to converse with strangers and shady acquaintances. It\'s these conversations that become a natural springboard for violence which are instigated by an unwelcome RPG-esque ""choose your response"" mechanic which slows the pace of the game to a crawl and constantly pulls you out of the reality of the game. Since this is the way Beat Down advances the plot, you won\'t be able to bypass these interludes to destruction - as I like to call them. Once the decision is made to interrogate, rob, recruit or fight- and let\'s face it, that\'s what you\'re playing for in the first place - then the violence explodes and faces and bodies are bloodied beyond recognition. As you progress you\'ll also be faced with the distribution of upgradeable power and techniques which seems to be coming standard in action games these days.\n\n\n\nBeat Down: FOV is a muddled affair, but it has its strengths. Although the fighting engine is weak Capcom keeps it real by allowing only 4 button play (kick, punch...it\'s all in the mind....sorry, Parappa flashback...kick, punch, block and special). Each character has different varieties of moves channeled from this configuration depending on whether you\'re hitting high or low. You can also learn new moves from the local barkeep who will also clue you in on some extra-curricular quests from time to time. If you can get past the repetition when it comes to initiating contact with the NPC\'s, you\'ll find that the fighting isn\'t all that bad, just extremely watered down. As you progress you will be able to recruit members to your ""gang"" and at times you\'ll find yourself embroiled in a battle royal with you battling alongside your partners. Your CPU-controlled brawling buddies actually handle themselves very well in a fight which means you can attend to the guy(s) in the corner and not have to worry about covering a teammates back. Another highlight is the ability to play through the game with 5 different characters all with different moves and storylines. At the very least you have to give Capcom points for replay value.\n\n\n\nIn terms of visual glitz and pizazz Beat Down looks very good. The character models are finely detailed and players who get off on such things will delight in the knowledge that realtime damage effects like blood and other repercussions of fighting are visible and remain that way until you regain some health - by drinking alcohol. There\'s a public service announcement for you right there.\n\n\n\nWhile I can\'t wholeheartedly recommend this game there is definitely an audience out there that will get off on the violence and ultra profanity; that\'s a given. Capcom did the right thing by allowing 2 player battles and extending the replay value with 5 characters but some gamers will have had enough of the load times and mind-numbing decisions by the end of the first story. Rent if you\'re curious.\n\n\n\nPreview By Chris\n\n\n\nCapcom is currently working on a new ""Old School Beat-Em-Up"" Style of game. The game will have a mix of the old style that these games had to offer while adding some new up to date features. Of course the first thing you will notice from the screen shots is the game is in 3-D.\n\n\n\nAlso Capcom is making the characters larger and the storyline will be up to today\'s standards. We all have seen the craze of taking the ""Old School"" games and updating them and re-releasing them. At times it works and at times the final product just sucks! (Anyone remember the Contra games that were recently release?) In any case, the story sounds interesting and while the details are limited, read on to see where Capcom is taking this new beat-em-up game and the features we do know so far.\n\n\n\nGamers will get to choose from 5 characters who were set-up to look ""bad"" in a family cartel. Hellbent on clearing their names as well as revenge, they go out looking for those who set them up. Of course just running around and talking to people would be boring so you will fight for info, money and other useful items as the story unfolds. Players will also try and find others to join up with them to go head to head against the Zanetti cartel - the main cartel that rules over the setting of Las Sombras, and the people responsible for setting up the 5 main characters. Or was it someone else other than Zanetti? (Cue in the sudden dramatic music here). It sounds like you will need to use your brains and brawn in this one. The game will also be arriving on the PS2 and both versions will be released sometime in the fall. Take a look at the screen shots and stay tuned for more info as soon as we can get it.\n\n\n\nClick For Media\n\n\n\nSystem: X, PS2 Dev: Capcom Pub: Capcom Release: Aug 2005 Players: 1 - 2 Review by Vaughn\n\n\n\nRATING (OUT OF 5)\n\n\n\nOVERALL\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\nGRAPHICS\n\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\nCONTROL\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\nMUSIC/FX\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\nVALUE\n\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\nBack to Xbox Reviews & Previews Index', ""html\n\n\n\nHome Page – The TLS\n\n\n\nThe times Literary supplement\n\n\n\nThe leading international weekly for literary culture\n\n\n\nLogout\n\n\n\nSubscribe Login\n\n\n\nLatest Edition\n\n\n\nSubjects\n\n\n\nMary Beard\n\n\n\nDaily\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nSearch:\n\n\n\nSearch by author, title, reviewer or keyword\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nThis week's TLS\n\n\n\nSeptember 14, 2018\n\n\n\nAlcohol and art; David Foster Wallace’s worst friend; the purpose of biography; asking a philosopher for advice; stories of Bruce Lee; how China became a twenty-first-century nation; gentleman publishers – and much more\n\n\n\nView edition\n\n\n\nIn next week's TLS\n\n\n\nOUT\n\n\n\n21 Sep 2018\n\n\n\nPHILIP HORNE\n\n\n\nHenry James in LA\n\n\n\nSUSAN IRVINE\n\n\n\nHow to read an Anglo-Saxon poem\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\n\nHow to advertise\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\n\nCopyright © The Times Literary Supplement Limited 2018.

It was a curious combination, but it worked because the gameplay was novel enough, the combined nostalgia for Star Wars and Legos was potent, and the experience was delivered with a humorous, lighthearted flair. Lego Star Wars II is an even better package than the original, due almost entirely to the fact that the emotional connection to A New Hope , Empire Strikes Back , and Return of the Jedi is much stronger for most people.\n\n\n\nIt works best as a nostalgia piece, but Lego Star Wars II is good fun on its own.\n\n\n\nYou start out in the Mos Eisley Cantina, which serves as a hub from which you can access all three episodes, as well as a counter where you can purchase extras like cheats and additional playable characters, and a new character creation counter. Initially you\'ll have access only to A New Hope, though you\'ll gain access to Empire and Jedi after beating the first chapter. The game hits nearly all of the most memorable sequences from all three films, and it does it all with a goofy sense of humor. Since the game will no doubt attract some hardcore Star Wars fans, it\'s also worth noting that Lego Star Wars II seems to be taking most of its cues from the original theatrical releases. This means you can expect Han to shoot first, Darth Vader to have eyebrows, and Return of the Jedi to end with the classic ""Yub Yub"" Ewok song. They\'re all minor points, but it\'s the kind of stuff that fans will definitely appreciate.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II is still primarily an action adventure game in which you control a group of characters as they blast their way through enemies and do some light puzzle-solving and the occasional platform-jumping. The size of your group expands and contracts regularly, growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times. You control only one character at a time, and you can switch characters easily on the fly. Your artificial intelligence-controlled companions are pretty worthless, save for a few specific scripted sequences. There\'s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters, which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed. Usually, though, the characters you\'re dragging around are there for a reason, as there are several different classes of characters, each with unique abilities that you\'ll need to progress. Jedi characters sport lightsabers, can perform double-jumps, and can use their Force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment. Regular hero characters like Princess Leia and Han Solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot. C3PO and R2D2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment, and R2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances. Short characters like Jawas and Ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n\n\nThese character classes were all in the original, though they\'ve been tweaked slightly. All nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of Legos into usable devices, something that originally only Jedi were capable of; many blaster-wielding characters will now auto-dodge incoming blaster fire; and most characters now have unique melee attacks--it\'s great to watch Chewie rip a stormtrooper\'s arms right out of their sockets or to see Lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were Ryu. Not only do all these refinements make non-Jedi characters more useful, they also lend the game a bit more personality. New to Lego Star Wars II are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters. Since you\'ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode, you\'ll have to rely on special helmet machines, which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter. It\'s a fragile ruse, though, because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off. The bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators, which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original. You\'ll happen upon small carts, landspeeders, and AT-STs that you can pilot in the action adventure chapters, though there are also chapters dedicated to memorable sequences like destroying both of the Death Stars, fighting off imperial forces in your snowspeeder on Hoth, and racing speeder bikes through the forests of Endor. These dedicated vehicle chapters make the game feel more epic and break up the action nicely, but Hoth has been done to death already, and some of the sequences aren\'t as visceral as you might like. This is due largely to a stiff camera, something that occasionally hampers the action adventure levels as well. The camera usually stays in a fixed position, and though you\'re allowed a little wiggle room, there are a few specific points where it\'s easy to get stuck because the path is obscured.\n\n\n\nThere\'s no dedicated multiplayer component to Lego Star Wars II, though it does offer cooperative play, and at any point a second player can just jump right in. It works seamlessly and reduces the number of generally useless AI companions, but it\'s also disappointing that no version of Lego Star Wars II features online co-op. Whether you\'re playing alone or with a friend, Lego Star Wars II is easy. As long as you\'re pointing in the general direction, blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own, and death is barely punished with a small loss of money. It should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around, but there\'s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back.\n\n\n\nOnce you play through a level in the story mode, you can play it again in free play mode, which gives you some control over which characters you\'ll play as, and you\'ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn\'t get to with the story mode characters. You\'ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game, but there are others that you\'ll need to purchase in the shop, and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original Lego Star Wars, if it appeared on the system you\'re playing on. The free play mode also lets you use your own custom-made characters, which you can build using pieces of other playable characters. It doesn\'t effect the gameplay, but there\'s still something really funny about putting Darth Vader\'s head on Princess Leia\'s body when she\'s in her slave costume. Several different types of collectibles, an unlockable series of bounty hunter missions, and time trial mode all help to create some good lasting value.\n\n\n\nThough the game is appearing on no less than eight different platforms, most of these versions are virtually indistinguishable. Featurewise, the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PC versions of Lego Star Wars II are nearly identical, and the PSP version is awfully close, though it takes a slightly different approach to certain unlockables, and it also has much more pronounced loading times. The current-gen console versions all look slightly better than the original Lego Star Wars, while the PC version looks a bit better than those, since it can run at much higher resolutions. By default, the PC version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme, though it’s easily modified. There’s also gamepad support, and we found that a wired Xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons.\n\n\n\nThe character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations.\n\n\n\nThe Xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair, with better reflections, better explosions, and a cool lens-focus effect that makes objects too close to or too far from the camera appear slightly blurry. It\'s definitely the best-looking version, but it\'s also got a very minor frame rate problem that crops up when there are a lot of particle effects. The achievement points in the Xbox 360 version are pretty well balanced. You’ll probably get almost 200 points just by playing through all three episodes, though there is also a string of achievements that require you to complete entire chapters without dying once, which in some cases is no small feat.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the platform, though, the visuals have a ton of charm. Getting to see recognizable Lego pieces mingling with recognizable Star Wars characters and locales is just really endearing, and Lego Star Wars II does it quite well. A vast library of recognizable sound effects and that unshakably rousing John Williams score make the experience feel that much more authentic, and even though there\'s no real voice acting in the game, some miming and appropriate-sounding mumbles make it apparent what\'s going on.\n\n\n\nAs much fun as Lego Star Wars II is, it\'s unfortunate that it had to come second. Some of the novelty of the gameplay, as well as the concept itself, isn\'t quite as potent as it was the first time around. The original Star Wars trilogy just seems more deserving of this nostalgic treatment than the prequels. Still, anyone with even a sliver of nostalgia for Star Wars will find this to be a fun, good-natured romp.\n\n\n\nUpvote\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nView Comments (0)\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nGameCube\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\nFun use of both the <i>Star Wars</i> and Lego licenses\n\n\n\nSeamless co-op play\n\n\n\nLonger, more challenging than predecessor\n\n\n\nMore vehicle sequences give better variety\n\n\n\nLoads of unlockable content\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nCamera occasionally obscures the action\n\n\n\nNo online co-op\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\nAbout GameSpot\'s Reviews\n\n\n\nOther Platform Reviews for Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nDS /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nXbox 360 /\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nRyan Davis\n\n\n\nMore GameSpot Reviews\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nNHL 19 Review -- A Barnburner\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n428: Shibuya Scramble Review - When Fates Collide\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA 2K19 Review - Another Year, Another Baller\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNintendo Labo Vehicle Kit Review: The Most Fun Labo Yet\n\n\n\nLoad Comments (0)\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\n\n%gameName%\n\n\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\n\n\n\nYou\'re Good to Go!\n\n\n\nWe\'ll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n\nFirst Released\n\n\n\nSep 12, 2006\n\n\n\nreleased\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance\n\n\n\n+ 8 more\n\n\n\nGameCube\n\n\n\nMacintosh\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPlayStation 2\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy has you controlling LEGO versions of the original Star Wars heroes.\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\nAverage Rating\n\n\n\n10920 Rating(s)\n\n\n\nPlease\n\n\n\nSign In\n\n\n\nto rate\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nDeveloped by:\n\n\n\nAmaze Entertainment\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTraveller\'s Tales\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nRobosoft Technologies\n\n\n\nPublished by:\n\n\n\nLucasArts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nElectronic Arts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFeral Interactive\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTHQ Wireless\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nActivision\n\n\n\nGenre(s):\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nAdventure\n\n\n\nTheme(s):\n\n\n\nSci-Fi\n\n\n\nEveryone 10+ Cartoon Violence, Crude Humor\n\n\n\n© 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

Although this sequel does almost everything the original LEGO Star Wars did, it won't receive the same amount of praise due to design excesses that hurt the delicate balance of the original. In other words, LSWII just has too much gameplay. I'll explain.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay of LEGO Star Wars never won awards, and it won't here either. You once again guide blaster- and lightsaber-wielding Star Wars characters through linear environments directly lifted from the films, fighting stormtroopers and flying in space vehicles. Nothing has changed from the original game, but of course gameplay wasn't the reason people played it; you trucked through the simple action and puzzles to see the LEGO-parody locations and joke-heavy cinemas.\n\n\n\nIt was appropriate, I am seeing now, that LSW was a short game. The quick completion of each level encouraged you to continue playing until you saw everything. LSWII also has plenty to see, but unfortunately, the levels are much longer and larger. Since they are never difficult, they broach monotony while yielding just as many rewards (read: visuals) as the previous game. The developer promised that LSW's lack of difficulty would be fixed this time around, but apparently they decided that more numerous and more difficult enemies would do the trick rather than revamped game design. I did occasionally get stuck at a puzzle or have to think about something for longer than usual, but this was more a frustration at obtuse objectives than active involvement with the game. Something the developer did decide to revamp is vehicle play: this time around the vehicle missions are free-roaming as opposed to set on rails, yet the vehicles still move forward on their own and the levels are mostly linear. These missions are confusing, have weird objectives, and are simply not as fun as the original's vehicle missions. The one exception to this is the excellent on-rails speeder bike mission on the moon of Endor. Otherwise, consider the uninteresting gameplay of the original LSW not fixed here, indeed broken twice over.\n\n\n\nThere are a few additions to gameplay that appear to spruce things up a bit. Most characters have a close range attack when next to an enemy and their purpose is mostly humor: Chewbacca rips off the arms of enemy combatants (an action discussed but never seen in Star Wars), while Leia, there's no other way to say this, bitch-slaps them. Also, some blaster characters can dodge laser fire if you stand still during a firefight, and blaster characters can now build objects out of broken LEGOs in context appropriate situations. There is also a mode to create your own LEGO character out of LEGO pieces and use him or her (or it) in the game. All of these additions are either aesthetic or tangential and alter the game very little.\n\n\n\nThe graphics of the game should receive high marks, again not for detail or complexity but for simple comic beauty. The worlds are much larger and rendered even better this time around, while the cinema scenes reach a Pixar-esque level of humor within their short length. I do think there was more to make fun of in the first three episodes of Star Wars than in this trilogy, but the developers have still made the short level intros and outros fun to watch if you're familiar with the movies. The sound, on the other hand, is just as sadly utilitarian as before – the music is lifted directly from the films and played on a loop. The sound effects are also accurately recreated making LSWII's audio authentic, if predictable.\n\n\n\nIf the game can be saved, it is through its cooperative mode – there really is no other way to play this game, especially now that the levels are larger and the objectives require more teamwork. Although the camera is still mostly unmovable and too rigid for two players to share, the game's emphasis on humor and nostalgia make co-op the only worthwhile way to play, and for all its faults, it is still fun.\n\n\n\nThere's plenty to keep you occupied here, as the developer has added objectives to Free Play mode (where you can switch between LEGO characters as you play) and many new items hidden in each level. All of these will gain you some secret levels that are, truthfully, not that satisfying. But there are plenty of things to do for completists.\n\n\n\nIn the end, I recommend LSWII to those who really loved the original – for me, it was worthwhile to see all the cinemas and locations, and plenty of fun in co-op. It doesn't live up to the original by any means, but it should offer a good distraction to those with nothing to play. Rent if you can.\n\n\n\nScore\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\n\nSound\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n\nGameplay\n\n\n\nLastability\n\n\n\nFinal\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\nWell rendered and detailed, the areas and animations in this game recall the Star Wars movies and LEGO pieces quite well.

Its gameplay—a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005). While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs – small, disk-shaped objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.



=== Playable characters ===



Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities.  This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the ""Use Old Save"" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data.Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley Cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible. Entering two cheat codes, publicized by IGN, makes pieces for a Santa Claus character available. The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used (for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name ""Darth-3PO""); alternately, the player may create a name.",Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars_II:_The_Original_Trilogy

ups and other goodies .\', \'there is a lot of interactivity in the game , between characters as well as the environments . characters can literally be combined using the character customizer which will allow you to make your own star wars characters out of any of the existing characters’ body parts . how about chewleia or darth3po ? a plethora of objects constructed out of lego blocks can be smashed and reassembled into other objects such as stairs or ramps to help you gain access to a hard -

saber while donning darth vader’s black cape . lucasarts will be rewarding owners of the original by using their save files to unlock the original unlockable characters . including the original characters , over 100 characters will be accessible in the original trilogy , including luke , lando , greedo , and every other memorable character imaginable .\', \'the customization doesn’t end there either . like in the original , players will construct different vehicles throughout the game to accomplish goals and clear levels . this time around , however , all non - droid characters will be able to construct vehicles from parts strewn across the stage . these pieces will be found behind obstacles and whatnot , requiring various character skills to access . additionally , hidden model kit pieces will be hidden in each of the levels throughout the trilogy , allowing you to use custom vehicles , which aren’t found by default in game , through specific stages .\', \'character specific combat and moves will be expanded upon , making the difference between playing as han solo and chewbacca two completely different gameplay experiences . while vader may be able to use a force choke - hold to defeat opponents , chewbacca will be adept at ripping the lego arms off of stormtroopers . as stated above , various characters will be able to solve specific puzzles as well . chewbacca’s brute strength would be useless in a specific stage , for instance , where luke’s force abilities would be required .\', \'these improvements and more , such as bigger level designs and a more competent camera system , will ensure that fans of the original will be more than satisfied by the lego telling of episodes four through six . look for the lego pieces to start flying late this summer .\', ""steam now selling uncensored adult games pubg drops to under one million players nintendo announces nintendo switch pokemon bundles breaking down the best of sony’s pre -

fi universe . with its unique art style , "" pick up and play "" mechanics , and the best use of a popular license that we \\\' d seen in a long , long time , it literally came out of nowhere to win critics and consumers over with its charming mix of action and humor . with a resume like that and three movies that could still be "" legofied "" remaining , a sequel was inevitable .\', \'eighteen months later we have it ( and for the first time , on psp ) . like the empire strikes back which inspired it , lego star wars ii : the original trilogy improves on its predecessor in just about every way . its stage design , source material , musical score , visual presentation , and jokes are all of a higher quality than they were before . there are even a number of additions that are new for the series altogether and extra mini - games thrown in just for the heck of it . in other words , the original trilogy is almost the perfect sequel .\', ""explaining how lego star wars works is actually quite simple . the main gameplay mechanics are essentially the same one - dimensional bits that make up most actioners out there ( with an attack , jump , and special button available ) . using basic strikes and defensive skills , players will regularly chop or blast their way through an unending army of stormtroopers , sand people , and bounty hunters while fighting the occasional boss or mid - boss every couple of levels . but that \' s where it \' s similarities to other titles ends ."", ""what makes lego star wars truly unique is that players will be in control of at least two characters at a time , and sometimes as many as six . with a quick tap of the button , gamers can hop back and forth between anybody in their party - - be they jedi , rebel , droid , or whatever - - and each of these archetypes play entirely different . so while luke skywalker and obi - wan kenobi may be ideal for taking out large groups thanks to their jumping lightsaber attacks , only droids can access certain areas that allow you entry to the next section . moreover , the standard blaster characters can mean the difference between life and death when fighting enemies from a distance and traveller \' s tales has done an excellent job of balancing things so that you \' ll have to rely on all these styles to succeed ."", ""this combination of straightforward mechanics and a clever use of strategy is what makes lego star wars so fun to play . but character selection for battles and the occasional door access isn \' t all there is to it . part of the game \' s brilliance is how it mixes puzzles with combat and how it makes use of the lego license by allowing players to build or destroy structures . fans of the first game are no doubt familiar with this system , but lego star wars ii has added a few new goodies to make the puzzles that much more elaborate and the pace that much faster . the fact that any non - droid character can now build items instead of just a jedi , for example , encourages the use of non - force personalities more than before . multi - screen puzzles with a couple of multi - solution outcomes are also welcome additions , while the inclusion of about a billion secrets is a good thing too ."", \'if multiplayer is your thing , then lego star wars has that also . just like last year \\\' s title , the original trilogy allows for immediate "" drop in / drop out "" two -

solving and the occasional platform - jumping . the size of your group expands and contracts regularly , growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times . you control only one character at a time , and you can switch characters easily on the fly . your artificial intelligence - controlled companions are pretty worthless , save for a few specific scripted sequences . there \' s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters , which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed . usually , though , the characters you \' re dragging around are there for a reason , as there are several different classes of characters , each with unique abilities that you \' ll need to progress . jedi characters sport lightsabers , can perform double - jumps , and can use their force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment . regular hero characters like princess leia and han solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot . c3po and r2d2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment , and r2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances . short characters like jawas and ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas ."", ""these character classes were all in the original , though they \' ve been tweaked slightly . all nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of legos into usable devices , something that originally only jedi were capable of ; many blaster - wielding characters will now auto - dodge incoming blaster fire ; and most characters now have unique melee attacks - - it \' s great to watch chewie rip a stormtrooper \' s arms right out of their sockets or to see lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were ryu . not only do all these refinements make non - jedi characters more useful , they also lend the game a bit more personality . new to lego star wars ii are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters . since you \' ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode , you \' ll have to rely on special helmet machines , which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter . it \' s a fragile ruse , though , because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off . the bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators , which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects ."", ""lego star wars ii puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original . you \' ll happen upon small carts , landspeeders , and at - sts that you can pilot in the action adventure chapters , though there are also chapters dedicated to memorable sequences like destroying both of the death stars , fighting off imperial forces in your snowspeeder on hoth , and racing speeder bikes through the forests of endor . these dedicated vehicle chapters make the game feel more epic and break up the action nicely , but hoth has been done to death already , and some of the sequences aren \' t as visceral as you might like . this is due largely to a stiff camera , something that occasionally hampers the action adventure levels as well . the camera usually stays in a fixed position , and though you \' re allowed a little wiggle room , there are a few specific points where it \' s easy to get stuck because the path is obscured ."", ""there \' s no dedicated multiplayer component to lego star wars ii , though it does offer cooperative play , and at any point a second player can just jump right in . it works seamlessly and reduces the number of generally useless ai companions , but it \' s also disappointing that no version of lego star wars ii features online co - op . whether you \' re playing alone or with a friend , lego star wars ii is easy . as long as you \' re pointing in the general direction , blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own , and death is barely punished with a small loss of money . it should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around , but there \' s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back ."", ""once you play through a level in the story mode , you can play it again in free play mode , which gives you some control over which characters you \' ll play as , and you \' ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn \' t get to with the story mode characters . you \' ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game , but there are others that you \' ll need to purchase in the shop , and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original lego star wars , if it appeared on the system you \' re playing on . the free play mode also lets you use your own custom - made characters , which you can build using pieces of other playable characters . it doesn \' t effect the gameplay , but there \' s still something really funny about putting darth vader \' s head on princess leia \' s body when she \' s in her slave costume . several different types of collectibles , an unlockable series of bounty hunter missions , and time trial mode all help to create some good lasting value ."", \'though the game is appearing on no less than eight different platforms , most of these versions are virtually indistinguishable . featurewise , the gamecube , playstation 2 , xbox , xbox 360 , and pc versions of lego star wars ii are nearly identical , and the psp version is awfully close , though it takes a slightly different approach to certain unlockables , and it also has much more pronounced loading times . the current - gen console versions all look slightly better than the original lego star wars , while the pc version looks a bit better than those , since it can run at much higher resolutions . by default , the pc version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme , though it’s easily modified . there’s also gamepad support , and we found that a wired xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons .\', \'the character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations .\', ""the xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair , with better reflections , better explosions , and a cool lens -

collect the lost studs . the game ' s central location is the mos eisley cantina , a spaceport bar on the planet tatooine . at the counter , the player may use their lego studs to purchase characters , vehicles , gameplay hints and extras , or activate cheat codes . in a small area outside the cantina , players may view collected vehicles . the game is broken into levels , which are accessed from the cantina ; each film is represented by six levels , representing key locations and scenes in that film . the locations include hoth , bespin , dagobah , tatooine , the death star , and endor . the game also features bonus levels . during levels , the player defeats enemies , builds objects out of lego bricks and drives vehicles , certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles , including a tie fighter , a snowspeeder , and the millennium falcon . levels must first be played in story mode . this unlocks the next level as well as a free play mode for the recently completed level . gameplay is identical in the two modes . however , story mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on , while free play offers all those unlocked . levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items . three types of secret items are available : gold bricks , minikits , and power bricks . within each level is hidden one power brick . when a power brick is collected , its corresponding extra , such as invincibility or stud multipliers , becomes available for purchase . each level also contains ten hidden minikits , that is , ten pieces of a star wars vehicle . when all ten have been collected , the player is awarded a gold brick . collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards , such as a spigot that spews out studs . gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed , and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level ; ninety - nine gold bricks are available . the vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina . as each vehicle is completed ( all ten minikits collected ) , it becomes available for play in a bonus level .



 == playable characters == 



over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game , including variations of luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , chewbacca , lando calrissian , r2 - d2 , c - 3po , darth vader , wicket the ewok , and boba fett . character abilities have a greater role in lego star wars ii than in lego star wars . certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas . characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles , double jump and use the force . r2 - d2 , c - 3po , and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors . small characters like the ewok and jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas . bounty hunters , such as boba fett , may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects . sith , like darth vader , can use the force to manipulate black lego objects . some characters have unique abilities ; for example , chewbacca can rip enemies ' arms from their sockets , darth vader can choke enemies with the force , princess leia possesses a slap attack , and lando calrissian can use a kung - fu - like attack . special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets , and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities . this means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode . the player can unlock the "" use old save "" extra , which imports all unlocked characters from lego star wars for use in free play ; however , a lego star wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains lego star wars ii ' s save data . players can create two customized characters in the mos eisley cantina . these characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters ; 2 , 258 , 163 , 204 combinations are possible . entering two cheat codes , publicized by ign , makes pieces for a santa claus character available . the game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used ( for example , a character made from pieces of darth vader and c - 3po might have the name "" darth - 3po "" ) ; alternately , the player may create a name .",lego star wars ii : the original trilogy,"[""html\n\n\n\nHome Page – The TLS\n\n\n\nThe times Literary supplement\n\n\n\nThe leading international weekly for literary culture\n\n\n\nLogout\n\n\n\nSubscribe Login\n\n\n\nLatest Edition\n\n\n\nSubjects\n\n\n\nMary Beard\n\n\n\nDaily\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nSearch:\n\n\n\nSearch by author, title, reviewer or keyword\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nThis week's TLS\n\n\n\nSeptember 14, 2018\n\n\n\nAlcohol and art; David Foster Wallace’s worst friend; the purpose of biography; asking a philosopher for advice; stories of Bruce Lee; how China became a twenty-first-century nation; gentleman publishers – and much more\n\n\n\nView edition\n\n\n\nIn next week's TLS\n\n\n\nOUT\n\n\n\n21 Sep 2018\n\n\n\nPHILIP HORNE\n\n\n\nHenry James in LA\n\n\n\nSUSAN IRVINE\n\n\n\nHow to read an Anglo-Saxon poem\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\n\nHow to advertise\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\n\nCopyright © The Times Literary Supplement Limited 2018.

The dinky characters are packed with charisma and the retelling of the story over 18 levels along with the hilarious film clips is both a loving tribute and a side-splitting parody.\n\n\n\nThanks to simple controls and the inspired decision to not penalise mistakes harshly, anyone can pick up a joypad and instantly have fun. But in response to the original\'s popularity among ""hardcore"" gamers, levels are now significantly larger and the puzzles more complex, which might mean youngsters need an occasional helping hand.\n\n\n\nFortunately, this is a perfect game for parents to enjoy with their kids. It fosters teamwork, lets players jump in and out of the action and it does not matter if one player is more skilled than another.\n\n\n\nOther improvements include a lot more secrets to reveal, more Lego building elements, new (and amusing) melee attacks, the chance to dodge incoming fire, animals to ride and vehicles to pilot, such as X-wings, Snowspeeders and the Millennium Falcon. Vehicle-based stages are now more in keeping with the on-foot action and plenty of ships are available, ensuring young players don\'t get frustrated.\n\n\n\nThe number of secrets to unlock makes the prospect of replaying levels even more appealing, especially with such a large cast. There\'s also a new character-combination feature that lets you mix parts from different characters to make new heroes, such as Han Vader.\n\n\n\nEndgame: A wonderful game that rewards experimentation and co-operation. Great fun for all ages.\n\n\n\nLicense this article\n\n\n\nGames\n\n\n\nMost Viewed in Technology\n\n\n\nLoading\n\n\n\nA relationship banned under traditional law.\n\n\n\nOur new podcast series from the team behind Phoebe\'s Fall\n\n\n\nView episodes\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nOur Sites\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nThe Age\n\n\n\nBrisbane Times\n\n\n\nThe Canberra Times\n\n\n\nWAtoday\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Review\n\n\n\nDomain\n\n\n\nTraveller\n\n\n\nGood Food\n\n\n\nExecutive Style\n\n\n\nThe Store by Fairfax\n\n\n\nDrive\n\n\n\nAdzuna\n\n\n\nRSVP\n\n\n\nEssential Baby\n\n\n\nEssential Kids\n\n\n\nWeatherzone\n\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\n\nTributes\n\n\n\nCelebrations\n\n\n\nPlace your ad\n\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\n\n\nOneflare\n\n\n\nNabo\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nContact & support\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\n\nAccessibility guide\n\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nProducts & Services\n\n\n\nSubscription packages\n\n\n\nSubscriber benefits\n\n\n\nMy account\n\n\n\nSubscriptions FAQs\n\n\n\nToday\'s Paper\n\n\n\nFairfax Media\n\n\n\nPhoto sales\n\n\n\nPurchase front pages\n\n\n\nFairfax syndication\n\n\n\nFairfax events\n\n\n\nFairfax careers\n\n\n\nConditions of use\n\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\nPress Council\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2018\n\n\n\nFairfax Media\n\n\n\nFeedback Subscribe', ""html\n\n\n\nReviews – GAMING TREND\n\n\n\nE3 2018\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nIndies\n\n\n\nVR\n\n\n\nTabletop\n\n\n\nPlatforms\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXBOX ONE\n\n\n\nSWITCH\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\nGear\n\n\n\nComics\n\n\n\nForum\n\n\n\nGAMING TREND\n\n\n\nE3 2018\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nReflect on what you’ve done — Senran Kagura Reflexions review\n\n\n\nA little bit of a weirdough — The Pizza Delivery Boy Who Saved the World review\n\n\n\nMy home is my castle — CastleStorm review\n\n\n\nYou’re not hunting her… she’s hunting you — Shadow of the Tomb Raider review\n\n\n\nGet your ∀ss to M∀rs — Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner – M∀RS review\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nYou wood not believe your eyes, Log Jammers campaign now live\n\n\n\nThe name’s Horizon, Forza Horizon 4 — Best of Bond Pack announced, demo available today\n\n\n\nNintendo Direct rescheduled and Nintendo Switch Online Service gets a release date!\n\n\n\nCutthroat and conniving scalawag Cervantes returns for SoulCalibur VI\n\n\n\nConquer the world with Revenant Dogma, out now on Xbox One\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nIndies\n\n\n\nVR\n\n\n\nTabletop\n\n\n\nPlatforms\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXBOX ONE\n\n\n\nSWITCH\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\nGear\n\n\n\nComics\n\n\n\nForum\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\nReflect on what you’ve done — Senran Kagura Reflexions review\n\n\n\nby Codi Spence\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 13, 2018\n\n\n\n156\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\nA little bit of a weirdough — The Pizza Delivery Boy Who Saved the World review\n\n\n\nby Elisha Deogracias\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 11, 2018\n\n\n\n233\n\n\n\n80\n\n\n\nMy home is my castle — CastleStorm review\n\n\n\nby Codi Spence\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n\nYou’re not hunting her… she’s hunting you — Shadow of the Tomb Raider review\n\n\n\nby Nathan Anstadt\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n557\n\n\n\n377\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\nGet your ∀ss to M∀rs — Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner – M∀RS review\n\n\n\nStarting Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner feels like tuning in halfway through a mid-season episode of an anime series you’ve...\n\n\n\nby Bryan Lawver\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 9, 2018\n\n\n\n440\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n\nMetro mania — Mini Metro review\n\n\n\nThe puzzle genre is not one I’m too engaged with outside of classics like Tetris and Doctor Mario.

Yes, the game lampoons the classic cinematic series but in the process it creates an alternate but independent Star Wars universe based on LEGO models which are based on the original Star Wars characters. This game has single handedly broken two cultural barriers: Star Wars isn’t just for nerds, and LEGO isn’t just for kids.\n\n\n\nAmazingly LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy follows the events of the first three Star Wars movies – in other words, the good ones. Liberties are taken with the plot but that’s all part of the fun. The Story mode does a great job of keeping characters and events in chronological order. All of your favorite Star Wars characters are featured in this game including Luke, Obi, Hans, the Princess, Chewy, R2, C3PO and Darth Vader. If you played the first LEGO Star Wars game you’ll be able to import your favorite characters from that game into this one. Each character has unique powers which will come in handy for different situations. While the gameplay is rather simple, there are tons of unlockables to find which creates its own kind of challenge. You will have to scour the levels from top to bottom to find these goodies which include everything from new characters to new modes. The only way that you can access all of the areas in each level is to exploit the different characters’ abilities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nThe Shame of Your Gaming Backlog\n\n\n\nThe Endless Tragedy of Digital Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nIs The Division Afraid to Get Political?\n\n\n\nIs Gaming Addiction a Thing (And Why We Can’t Decide)\n\n\n\nWhy You Might Be a Game Glitch Snob\n\n\n\nHow Gaming Ruins Relationships (And Why It Should Stop)\n\n\n\nWhy Video Game Secrets Matter\n\n\n\nCan Non-Fans Enjoy Sports Games?\n\n\n\nLet\'s Trade Microtransactions for Unlockables\n\n\n\nThis Sequel Will Send You into a RAGE!\n\n\n\nWhere Should Nintendo’s Classics Go Next?\n\n\n\nHow Fortnite Became #1 (and PUBG Didn\'t)\n\n\n\nWhy Deadpool Is F%#king Awesomesauce\n\n\n\nWhy PUBG Is Screwing up Big Time\n\n\n\nHow Video Games Can Get You Arrested\n\n\n\nMore Special Features...\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nLuke and Obi have the Force on their side. With it they can move LEGO objects that would otherwise be immovable. They are also equipped with lightsabers which not only take care of enemies quite nicely but can also be used to foil laser traps which will get them into inaccessible areas. When it comes to ranged combat, Hans Solo and Princess Leia use laser blasters to take out the enemy from a relatively safe distance. They are also equipped with grappling hooks so that they can climb walls and get to higher regions. To get through locked doors you will need the skills of the droids. This is where R2 and C3PO earn their keep. They can hack into computer networks and retrieve access codes to open sealed doors. With his attached rockets, R2D2 has the added ability to propel himself across wide expanses. Being evil has its benefits as well. The dark Sith lord, Darth Vader also has the Force at his command and can also move various LEGO blocks and objects. In fact there are certain ones that can only be moved by those who have joined the dark side. All of these different powers will allow you to seek out hidden treasures located throughout each level. You may just want to tackle the Story mode first and come back for the collectibles later. Regardless of how you pace yourself there is always plenty of things to do in this game.\n\n\n\nAside from the main Story mode, there is a Free Mode which lets you play as any character in any level that you’ve previously unlocked. This is why it may be to your benefit to complete the Story mode first so that you can go back as any character to search for the unlockables. The Super Story mode is a race against time. You have one hour to get through one of the three movie episode levels. You won’t have any time to waste so you’ll just have to push through it. If you manage to accomplish this task you’ll be rewarded with gold bricks which you can use to unlock even more levels. In the bonus rounds you will be able to collect LEGO studs, a million of them to be exact. These studs are used like money. With them you can purchase weapons, power-ups and other goodies.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of interactivity in the game, between characters as well as the environments. Characters can literally be combined using the Character Customizer which will allow you to make your own Star Wars characters out of any of the existing characters’ body parts. How about ChewLeia or Darth3PO? A plethora of objects constructed out of LEGO blocks can be smashed and reassembled into other objects such as stairs or ramps to help you gain access to a hard-to-reach area. In this game, as opposed to the first one, the vehicles that you build such as the Tie Fighters and Star Destroyer can actually be used.\n\n\n\nAnother player can join in anytime and instantly access the Co-op mode. There is always another AI character with you and the player will assume the role of that particular character the instant he or she enters the game. That character can then be relegated back to the AI at anytime and the main player will not be affected at all by the change. This is a well thought-out system that will encourage multi-playing with even the most inexperienced of gamers. It’s unfortunate there isn’t an online mode but considering how much is offered in this title, one can’t really complain much.\n\n\n\nThe production values are good but they aren’t great. There are some camera issues but you do have more control over it than with the first game. There are some framerate hiccups but overall it’s relatively smooth going. The characters look amazing and the stages are filled with detail and depth totally befitting the LEGO/Star Wars universe – which is basically composed of shiny, plastic, material. There aren’t any voiceovers but I hope you weren’t expecting this to be voiced by the original cast. The score is obviously composed by John Williams and even though you’ve heard it before, there’s nothing else that could be more fitting, save perhaps the entire orchestration performed through a shiny, plastic, Casio keyboard.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, LEGO Star Wars II is action, adventure, collecting, puzzles, races, mini-game, Co-op mode and your favorite Star Wars characters all having a great time. All you need is a copy of this game to join in on the fun. Highly recommended for players of all ages.\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n\nRelive the Fun in a Whole New Way! The game that lets you combine the fun of LEGO with all the action and excitement of Star Wars now lets you battle through all your favorite moments in the Original Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI).\n\n\n\nFrom Luke and Princess Leia to Han Solo and Darth Vader, now play over 50 of your favorite characters in a humorous and unique LEGO setting.\n\n\n\nBuild and Customize with a Galaxy of New Features. For the first time ever, you can build and ride new vehicles and creatures and get in and out to explore the world of the Original Star Wars Trilogy.

From the simple building blocks of a house to the multi-colored “planks” of a pirate ship or a square, boxy build of a race car, the only limitation to what you can build is the imagination. So when last year, LucasArts reached into our childhoods with their retelling of Episodes One through Three in LEGO Star Wars. Answering the calls of countless fans, myself included, LucasArts will now retell the original trilogy in LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy.\n\n\n\nStarring the cast of the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II will refine the formula set by its predecessor in providing fun adventure gameplay and combat while remaining fairly accessible to casual gamers. One of the most important adjustments to the “ease” in gameplay will be the adjustable difficulty. If, throughout a level perhaps, you are getting your rear handed to you by various storm troopers and the like, the game will adjust its difficulty down to allow players to continue making progress through the game instead of giving up in frustration. On the other hand, if you are slaughtering everything you come across without so much as a ding, which may have been the case for some players of the original, then the difficulty will ratchet upwards to keep play interesting.\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars allowed players to play as their favorite characters throughout the game and unlock countless goodies, but The Original Trilogy will go one better by allowing players to customize their character with interchangeable parts. That’s right, you can have the head of Princess Leia on the body of Han Solo carrying a light-saber while donning Darth Vader’s black cape. LucasArts will be rewarding owners of the original by using their save files to unlock the original unlockable characters. Including the original characters, over 100 characters will be accessible in The Original Trilogy, including Luke, Lando, Greedo, and every other memorable character imaginable.\n\n\n\nThe customization doesn’t end there either. Like in the original, players will construct different vehicles throughout the game to accomplish goals and clear levels. This time around, however, all non-droid characters will be able to construct vehicles from parts strewn across the stage. These pieces will be found behind obstacles and whatnot, requiring various character skills to access. Additionally, hidden model kit pieces will be hidden in each of the levels throughout the trilogy, allowing you to use custom vehicles, which aren’t found by default in game, through specific stages.\n\n\n\nCharacter specific combat and moves will be expanded upon, making the difference between playing as Han Solo and Chewbacca two completely different gameplay experiences. While Vader may be able to use a Force Choke-Hold to defeat opponents, Chewbacca will be adept at ripping the LEGO arms off of stormtroopers. As stated above, various characters will be able to solve specific puzzles as well.

Now, I\'m guessing that if you\n\n\n\ndid\n\n\n\npass on playing the first game that it was because you thought it was ""a dumb kid\'s game"" or because ""the game\'s based on the\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nprequels, and those suck."" Well, that second excuse won\'t fly anymore because this sequel is based on the original trilogy. You know, the one that everyone likes.\n\n\n\nAs for that first excuse, the\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars\n\n\n\ngames are more family games than pure kid\'s games (and they\'re hardly ""dumb""). Sure, they\'re simple enough for a kid to pick up and enjoy, and a skilled player can plow through the main story mode in a few hours, but there\'s a lot more depth below the surface.\n\n\n\nFor the benefit of those who may not have noticed the\n\n\n\nmultiple recent previews of the game\n\n\n\n, here\'s what\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II\n\n\n\nis all about. It\'s based on the popular line of LEGO sets that are based on the popular movies. The game\'s Story Mode is split up into three parts, each one focusing on one of the original\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nfilms. Within each of these film-based sections, there are six stages.\n\n\n\nThe first time you play through each stage, the characters that you can control are dependent on the movie\'s storyline. When on the swamp world of Dagobah, for instance, you can only play as Luke, R2-D2, and Yoda since they were the only characters on that planet in\n\n\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\n\n\n. After completing each stage, you typically unlock new playable characters, including most of the enemies that you face in the game. Completed stages can then be revisited in Free Mode, which allows you to select whatever character you want to play as, and a party of other characters is automatically chosen to accompany you in the level.\n\n\n\nThey\'re Full of Surprises\n\n\n\nHaving a wide variety of characters in Free Mode is important since there are lots of secrets to discover and many characters have unique skills. Jedi characters like Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi use their lightsabers to deflect incoming laser fire, and the Force allows them to manipulate certain LEGO elements within each stage. Some LEGO bricks can only be controlled by evil Sith lords. Here\'s where Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine come into play. ""Blaster"" characters are those armed with laser guns, including Han Solo and Princess Leia. They can not only attack enemies from afar with their lasers, but they\'re also armed with grappling hooks that allow them to reach high places. Locked doors need droids to open, so keep R2-D2 and C-3PO around. R2 can even use his leg-mounted rockets (which is only used in the prequel trilogy) to cross large pits. Bounty hunters like Boba Fett can toss explosive thermal detonators that are required to destroy certain objects and obstacles. Making proper use of each of the characters\' abilities is necessary in order to track down all the hidden goodies in each level.\n\n\n\nYour exploration efforts will be rewarded with new gameplay modes, all of which have you competing against the clock (and another player, if you choose). The Character Bonus places you within a maze-like arena inspired by different levels and times you on how quickly you can collect a million LEGO studs (this may sound like a daunting task, but it can typically be done in less than five minutes). If you\'ve played the original\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars\n\n\n\n, you will remember collecting Minikit Canisters which were used to build model vehicles. In that game, the vehicles could just be admired, but now, they have a purpose. Any vehicle that you construct can be used in the Minikit Bonus levels. They play just like the Character Bonus stages, except you can pilot several different ships. If you ever wanted a game that let you fly around one of Jabba\'s skiffs or a Star Destroyer, then look no further.\n\n\n\nNext:\n\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n\n>>\n\n\n\nPage:\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nWhat Do You Think?\n\n\n\nLatest Reviews\n\n\n\nXiaolin Showdown\n\n\n\n(Nov 30, 2006)\n\n\n\nEragon\n\n\n\n(Nov 29, 2006)\n\n\n\nSuperman Returns: The Videogame\n\n\n\n(Nov 28, 2006)\n\n\n\nThrillville\n\n\n\n(Nov 21, 2006)\n\n\n\nTony Hawk\'s Project 8\n\n\n\n(Nov 14, 2006)\n\n\n\n::\n\n\n\nMore Reviews...\n\n\n\nFollow GameSpy on Twitter\n\n\n\nGet the Latest in Gaming News\n\n\n\nAround the Network\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The... at IGN\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The...

Most impressive.\n\n\n\nBy Jeremy Dunham\n\n\n\nOne of last year\'s more pleasant surprises was undoubtedly LEGO Star Wars, the TT Games-developed ode to George Lucas\' incredibly popular sci-fi universe. With its unique art style, ""pick up and play"" mechanics, and the best use of a popular license that we\'d seen in a long, long time, it literally came out of nowhere to win critics and consumers over with its charming mix of action and humor. With a resume like that and three movies that could still be ""LEGOfied"" remaining, a sequel was inevitable.\n\n\n\nEighteen months later we have it (and for the first time, on PSP). Like The Empire Strikes Back which inspired it, LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy improves on its predecessor in just about every way. Its stage design, source material, musical score, visual presentation, and jokes are all of a higher quality than they were before. There are even a number of additions that are new for the series altogether and extra mini-games thrown in just for the heck of it. In other words, The Original Trilogy is almost the perfect sequel.\n\n\n\nExplaining how LEGO Star Wars works is actually quite simple. The main gameplay mechanics are essentially the same one-dimensional bits that make up most actioners out there (with an attack, jump, and special button available). Using basic strikes and defensive skills, players will regularly chop or blast their way through an unending army of Stormtroopers, Sand People, and Bounty Hunters while fighting the occasional boss or mid-boss every couple of levels. But that\'s where it\'s similarities to other titles ends.\n\n\n\nWhat makes LEGO Star Wars truly unique is that players will be in control of at least two characters at a time, and sometimes as many as six. With a quick tap of the button, gamers can hop back and forth between anybody in their party -- be they Jedi, Rebel, Droid, or whatever -- and each of these archetypes play entirely different. So while Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi may be ideal for taking out large groups thanks to their jumping lightsaber attacks, only droids can access certain areas that allow you entry to the next section. Moreover, the standard blaster characters can mean the difference between life and death when fighting enemies from a distance and Traveller\'s Tales has done an excellent job of balancing things so that you\'ll have to rely on all these styles to succeed.\n\n\n\nThis combination of straightforward mechanics and a clever use of strategy is what makes LEGO Star Wars so fun to play. But character selection for battles and the occasional door access isn\'t all there is to it. Part of the game\'s brilliance is how it mixes puzzles with combat and how it makes use of the LEGO license by allowing players to build or destroy structures. Fans of the first game are no doubt familiar with this system, but LEGO Star Wars II has added a few new goodies to make the puzzles that much more elaborate and the pace that much faster. The fact that any non-droid character can now build items instead of just a Jedi, for example, encourages the use of non-force personalities more than before. Multi-screen puzzles with a couple of multi-solution outcomes are also welcome additions, while the inclusion of about a billion secrets is a good thing too.\n\n\n\nIf multiplayer is your thing, then LEGO Star Wars has that also. Just like last year\'s title, The Original Trilogy allows for immediate ""Drop in/ Drop Out"" two-player co-op at any time (via Ad Hoc) with a few small tweaks thrown in for good measure. Take the camera, for instance. Now it draws back much further than it use to before requiring characters to move closer to one another. There\'s an all-new (and extensive) character creation feature built-in as well, and it allows users of vastly different play styles and preferences to hook up however they want. Sadly, infrastructure co-op isn\'t supported in LSW2, and even if you\'re playing via Wi-Fi, if one person moves to the next screen by himself, player two is auto-transported to that location no matter what he might be in the middle of doing.\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNext »\n\n\n\nWiki Guide 25 Pages\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\nUpdate: Nintendo Switch Getting 6.0.0 Update Next Week\n\n\n\nAHS: Apocalypse Kicked Things Off with...The End\n\n\n\nWhy It\'s Insane That Warner Bros.

It was a curious combination, but it worked because the gameplay was novel enough, the combined nostalgia for Star Wars and Legos was potent, and the experience was delivered with a humorous, lighthearted flair. Lego Star Wars II is an even better package than the original, due almost entirely to the fact that the emotional connection to A New Hope , Empire Strikes Back , and Return of the Jedi is much stronger for most people.\n\n\n\nIt works best as a nostalgia piece, but Lego Star Wars II is good fun on its own.\n\n\n\nYou start out in the Mos Eisley Cantina, which serves as a hub from which you can access all three episodes, as well as a counter where you can purchase extras like cheats and additional playable characters, and a new character creation counter. Initially you\'ll have access only to A New Hope, though you\'ll gain access to Empire and Jedi after beating the first chapter. The game hits nearly all of the most memorable sequences from all three films, and it does it all with a goofy sense of humor. Since the game will no doubt attract some hardcore Star Wars fans, it\'s also worth noting that Lego Star Wars II seems to be taking most of its cues from the original theatrical releases. This means you can expect Han to shoot first, Darth Vader to have eyebrows, and Return of the Jedi to end with the classic ""Yub Yub"" Ewok song. They\'re all minor points, but it\'s the kind of stuff that fans will definitely appreciate.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II is still primarily an action adventure game in which you control a group of characters as they blast their way through enemies and do some light puzzle-solving and the occasional platform-jumping. The size of your group expands and contracts regularly, growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times. You control only one character at a time, and you can switch characters easily on the fly. Your artificial intelligence-controlled companions are pretty worthless, save for a few specific scripted sequences. There\'s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters, which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed. Usually, though, the characters you\'re dragging around are there for a reason, as there are several different classes of characters, each with unique abilities that you\'ll need to progress. Jedi characters sport lightsabers, can perform double-jumps, and can use their Force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment. Regular hero characters like Princess Leia and Han Solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot. C3PO and R2D2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment, and R2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances. Short characters like Jawas and Ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n\n\nThese character classes were all in the original, though they\'ve been tweaked slightly. All nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of Legos into usable devices, something that originally only Jedi were capable of; many blaster-wielding characters will now auto-dodge incoming blaster fire; and most characters now have unique melee attacks--it\'s great to watch Chewie rip a stormtrooper\'s arms right out of their sockets or to see Lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were Ryu. Not only do all these refinements make non-Jedi characters more useful, they also lend the game a bit more personality. New to Lego Star Wars II are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters. Since you\'ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode, you\'ll have to rely on special helmet machines, which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter. It\'s a fragile ruse, though, because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off. The bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators, which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original. You\'ll happen upon small carts, landspeeders, and AT-STs that you can pilot in the action adventure chapters, though there are also chapters dedicated to memorable sequences like destroying both of the Death Stars, fighting off imperial forces in your snowspeeder on Hoth, and racing speeder bikes through the forests of Endor. These dedicated vehicle chapters make the game feel more epic and break up the action nicely, but Hoth has been done to death already, and some of the sequences aren\'t as visceral as you might like. This is due largely to a stiff camera, something that occasionally hampers the action adventure levels as well. The camera usually stays in a fixed position, and though you\'re allowed a little wiggle room, there are a few specific points where it\'s easy to get stuck because the path is obscured.\n\n\n\nThere\'s no dedicated multiplayer component to Lego Star Wars II, though it does offer cooperative play, and at any point a second player can just jump right in. It works seamlessly and reduces the number of generally useless AI companions, but it\'s also disappointing that no version of Lego Star Wars II features online co-op. Whether you\'re playing alone or with a friend, Lego Star Wars II is easy. As long as you\'re pointing in the general direction, blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own, and death is barely punished with a small loss of money. It should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around, but there\'s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back.\n\n\n\nOnce you play through a level in the story mode, you can play it again in free play mode, which gives you some control over which characters you\'ll play as, and you\'ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn\'t get to with the story mode characters. You\'ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game, but there are others that you\'ll need to purchase in the shop, and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original Lego Star Wars, if it appeared on the system you\'re playing on. The free play mode also lets you use your own custom-made characters, which you can build using pieces of other playable characters. It doesn\'t effect the gameplay, but there\'s still something really funny about putting Darth Vader\'s head on Princess Leia\'s body when she\'s in her slave costume. Several different types of collectibles, an unlockable series of bounty hunter missions, and time trial mode all help to create some good lasting value.\n\n\n\nThough the game is appearing on no less than eight different platforms, most of these versions are virtually indistinguishable. Featurewise, the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PC versions of Lego Star Wars II are nearly identical, and the PSP version is awfully close, though it takes a slightly different approach to certain unlockables, and it also has much more pronounced loading times. The current-gen console versions all look slightly better than the original Lego Star Wars, while the PC version looks a bit better than those, since it can run at much higher resolutions. By default, the PC version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme, though it’s easily modified. There’s also gamepad support, and we found that a wired Xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons.\n\n\n\nThe character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations.\n\n\n\nThe Xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair, with better reflections, better explosions, and a cool lens-focus effect that makes objects too close to or too far from the camera appear slightly blurry. It\'s definitely the best-looking version, but it\'s also got a very minor frame rate problem that crops up when there are a lot of particle effects. The achievement points in the Xbox 360 version are pretty well balanced. You’ll probably get almost 200 points just by playing through all three episodes, though there is also a string of achievements that require you to complete entire chapters without dying once, which in some cases is no small feat.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the platform, though, the visuals have a ton of charm. Getting to see recognizable Lego pieces mingling with recognizable Star Wars characters and locales is just really endearing, and Lego Star Wars II does it quite well. A vast library of recognizable sound effects and that unshakably rousing John Williams score make the experience feel that much more authentic, and even though there\'s no real voice acting in the game, some miming and appropriate-sounding mumbles make it apparent what\'s going on.\n\n\n\nAs much fun as Lego Star Wars II is, it\'s unfortunate that it had to come second. Some of the novelty of the gameplay, as well as the concept itself, isn\'t quite as potent as it was the first time around. The original Star Wars trilogy just seems more deserving of this nostalgic treatment than the prequels. Still, anyone with even a sliver of nostalgia for Star Wars will find this to be a fun, good-natured romp.\n\n\n\nUpvote\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nView Comments (0)\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\nFun use of both the <i>Star Wars</i> and Lego licenses\n\n\n\nSeamless co-op play\n\n\n\nLonger, more challenging than predecessor\n\n\n\nMore vehicle sequences give better variety\n\n\n\nLoads of unlockable content\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nCamera occasionally obscures the action\n\n\n\nNo online co-op\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\nAbout GameSpot\'s Reviews\n\n\n\nOther Platform Reviews for Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nDS /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nXbox 360 /\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nRyan Davis\n\n\n\nMore GameSpot Reviews\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA 2K19 Review - Another Year, Another Baller\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nShadow Of The Tomb Raider Review - Guerilla Girl\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nValkyria Chronicles 4 Review - Soar High\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA Live 19 Review -- Dribbling Forward\n\n\n\nLoad Comments (0)\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\n\n%gameName%\n\n\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\n\n\n\nYou\'re Good to Go!\n\n\n\nWe\'ll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n\nFirst Released\n\n\n\nSep 12, 2006\n\n\n\nreleased\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance\n\n\n\n+ 8 more\n\n\n\nGameCube\n\n\n\nMacintosh\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPlayStation 2\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy has you controlling LEGO versions of the original Star Wars heroes.\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\nAverage Rating\n\n\n\n10920 Rating(s)\n\n\n\nPlease\n\n\n\nSign In\n\n\n\nto rate\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nDeveloped by:\n\n\n\nAmaze Entertainment\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTraveller\'s Tales\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nRobosoft Technologies\n\n\n\nPublished by:\n\n\n\nLucasArts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nElectronic Arts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFeral Interactive\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTHQ Wireless\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nActivision\n\n\n\nGenre(s):\n\n\n\nAdventure\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nTheme(s):\n\n\n\nSci-Fi\n\n\n\nEveryone 10+ Cartoon Violence, Crude Humor\n\n\n\n© 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

Privacy Policy - Terms of Service']",2006-09-12,"Lego Star Wars II's gameplay is from a third-person perspective, and takes place in a 3D game world that contains objects, environments and characters designed to resemble Lego pieces. Its gameplay—a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005). While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs – small, disk-shaped objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.



=== Playable characters ===



Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities.  This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the ""Use Old Save"" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data.Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley Cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible. Entering two cheat codes, publicized by IGN, makes pieces for a Santa Claus character available. The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used (for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name ""Darth-3PO""); alternately, the player may create a name.",Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars_II:_The_Original_Trilogy

saxons , and obviously the norman conquest that pivoted around the battle of hastings in 1066 . the rest of my knowledge is a little hazy , but that gives thrones of britannia the opportunity to teach me some things . it’s cool to look at the map and see lunden , mameceaster , snotingaham and other cities that continue today but with slightly different names – no , you won’t spot milton keynes on here .\', \'the introductory videos for each faction also lays the historical foundations for you , rendered to look like gorgeous layered metalwork . take on the role of king alfred in west seaxe – wessex in modern english – and you’re in a position of great power with numerous vassal states , but also face the continuing threat of viking sea king invasions and the lingering resentment that the great viking army have , having been forced to settle to the north east . you can obviously play as those two factions as well , or take on the role of the welsh , scots and irish in this world , seeking to unite their fractured lands under one banner .\', \'while the campaign map is nowhere near the size of , say , total war : rome ii or total war : warhammer , creative assembly have zoomed in and packed it full of smaller regions , provinces and settlements . it still feels like a fairly big map , though probably closer to some of the campaigns previously featured in total war expansions . it plays well , however , and there’s a pace and fluidity inherent in its design . while major settlements have walls and can have huge holding garrisons , the smaller settlements within each province are less substantial than in other games . they often just have a single building to them and you can simply march through them to occupy or plunder , letting you choke a rival faction through pillaging before you attack their walls .\', \'building your armies has been significantly altered for thrones . instead of simply buying a unit and then having it ready at full strength in your army , you’re instead presented with a depleted unit that has to muster over time while in friendly territory . it might take a good few turns before they’re at full strength , but the trade off is that you can recruit any of your unlocked units wherever you are and not just in a particular region , though each unit’s recruitment pool is limited and only replenishes gradually over time . with enough reserves of gold and food , you can quickly draw together an army at the maximum 20 units , especially with later tech tree unlocks .\', \'in battle , things are kept relatively straight forward thanks to the limited variety in different troop types you can have and an emphasis on shield - based tactics of the day . creating shield walls can defend from archers and javelins , as well as halt a cavalry charge , but they’re obviously weak to flanking . on standard difficulty , it’s fairly easy to roll over enemies , especially once you’ve unlocked more advanced versions of the handful of unit types .\', \'the tech tree is now based around your actions and choices , as opposed to simply setting your smartest minds to ponder what a “longbow” or “catapult” is . if you want better spearmen , you need to recruit ten spearmen units to unlock their upgrade path , if you want siege weapons , you need to besiege five province capitals , and for certain civic upgrades , it’s about fully upgrading certain building types to unlock taverns , libraries , and so on .\', \'it’s an approach that also works well with the simplified noblemen system . agents have been done away with , but you can assign characters to either lead your armies or govern a province . they now have three attributes of heroism , governance and zeal that are improved by spending skill points in various categories , and these help boost certain aspects of their army and province management . the one thing you might have to be aware of is their loyalty to you and if they’re more influential than your leader , but there’s everything from rewarding them with country estates through to simple assassinations to keep these in check .\', \'each faction has their own special features , like west seaxe’s witan council of nobles to propose policy changes , and there are certain narrative events that pop up that can be quite fun , such as an ambitious governor seeking to take on certain responsibilities that i slapped down . he responded by plotting against me with fake family trees and other equally devious schemes .\', \'however they could have made more of these moments . after a while , i simply learnt that i needed to hand over country estates and they’d get on with their jobs , and could happily ignore the missions pointing me to capture settlements halfway across the map . diplomacy hasn’t really changed outside of now having arranged marriages to help improve relations . it’s still nigh on impossible , i find , to create vassal states until they’re about to make a last stand , which simply pushes me to war once more .\', \'after total war : warhammer ii’s great vortex campaign , thrones naturally has to step back to reality . the overriding goal is conquest and domination once more , but there’s a few differences in how you can go about this . you have the conquest and kingdom goals in both short and long forms , where you’re tasked with either ruling a certain number or particular set of provinces , but there’s also fame . this allows you to be a little more benevolent and less bloodthirsty , seeking to grow your technology or capture certain settlements and important buildings for their fame boost . the short campaign goals provide you a convenient out after around 10 - 12 hours before the grind of conquering can set in , which is something i very much appreciate .\', \'while the way the game has been streamlined helps certain parts of the interface , the menus can still be a bit maze - like at times . keeping a grip of the long list of noblemen in a sprawling kingdom would be tricky at the best of times , but your kingdom’s bloat is annoying when the start of your turn has pop ups that talk about characters you can’t remember , don’t tell you where they’re in charge of and don’t let you put them to one side to get an understanding of the situation . you’re forced to make a summary judgement with barely any facts .\', \'while total war has often focussed on the big picture , thrones of britannia shows there’s plenty of scope for a series of total war saga offshoots to explore the smaller conflicts and civil wars through history . it’s also a great place for creative assembly to experiment with gameplay , and the changes to recruitment , tech trees and story elements give us a glimpse of what the series might hold in future .\', \'we do not license content or design to any other site . this wordpress theme is the legal property of oscar mike media . no element of this site can be used without written permission . all content should be considered opinion . article posters are the individual owner of the article content . we are not affiliated with any third party .\', \'use of this website is subject to acceptance of our legal terms of service . staff / contact us | review policy | privacy policy | cookies policy advertising and pr : pr @ thesixthaxis . com | news : tips @ thesixthaxis . com thesixthaxis is featured on : metacritic , google news | listed on : newsnow all original content is copyright © 2016 thesixthaxis . com powered by oscar mike media | uk hosting by krystal .\']', ""['pc games news and reviews from pcgamesn . com', 'poised as we are on the brink of brexit , it seems cannily appropriate for creative assembly to release a game all about the era in which england became a nation . starting off in 878 ad , thrones of britannia sees alfred the great on a quest to push back against a viking invasion from the north east , with the aim of unifying the land under the banner of the anglo - saxons . admittedly , my clumsy first attempt at controlling the great monarch saw him perish within two years , wessex fall into civil war , and my armies starve , but the point still stands .', 'alfred’s story is just one of many you can potentially screw up : the game gives you the option to play as ten factions , each with different alliances , strengths , and objectives . for instance , you could opt to play as the welsh king anaraut on a mission to unite wales , the irish king flann on a quest to become high king of ireland , or the scottish king aed as he attempts to repel rival clans and resist the viking invaders . and if you’re not feeling particularly patriotic you could even play as the viking invaders themselves , seeking to subjugate britain under the sharp end of an axe .', 'gameplay follows the usual total war template , with two different modes : a map view in which you can move your armies , construct buildings , research technology , and engage in diplomacy ; and a battle view in which you conduct your army during a fight . as ever , the scale and complexity of the skirmishes is impressive , as you carefully manoeuvre up to 20 different troop units into strategic positions , attempting to outflank the enemy or slam a humiliating cavalry charge from the rear . the ability to zoom seamlessly from a bird’s eye view right down to the eye level of individual fighters still amazes even after all these years .', 'laying siege to a provincial capital also makes a refreshing change from the regular battles – catapults are a rare , late - game unit , so sieges are now protracted , bloody affairs defined by rams and siege towers . a great variety of settlement maps , some of which are based directly on their historical layouts , also ensures that no two such undertakings feel quite the same .', 'thrones of britannia follows hot on the hooves , claws , and wings of total war : warhammer ii , another hugely successful spin - off . while britannia’s achievement is finding focus in the form of a single island , warhammer ii does the opposite - amplifying total war like never before . the series has traditionally stumbled when going large , which makes this victory all the sweeter .', 'battles are also slower than in recent total wars – certainly warhammer – as creative assembly aim to simulate the tactics of the day : if infantry have shields , they’ll default to fighting in a shieldwall formation , and can protect against missiles with a shield castle . this makes them very resilient as frontline infantry go , especially since heavy cavalry are rare , leaving two - handed infantry as most armies’ typical shock troops . most battles are about keeping those shock troops alive long enough to bring them to bear ( lacking shields , they’re much more vulnerable to missile fire ) , or trying to win an advantage on the flanks with skirmishers . it’s a tense , drawn - out business .', 'impressive as it all is , i found that i rarely used the battle view in the course of play . as in previous entries to the series , every time you engage with an enemy army , there’s an option to have the ai instantly take care of the battle for you – and as long as you outnumber the enemy , you’re pretty much guaranteed a welcome outcome . the only times i stepped in to play a battle manually were occasions when i was attacked by an army of equal or greater force , in the hope that a few cunning tactics might tip the battle in my favour . in the campaign at least , battles are more of a side show – the meat of the game is in the map and the menus .', 'luckily the map itself is a thing of beauty , alive with rippling grass , criss - crossing caravans , and viking longships harassing the coast . it’s jarring to return from warhammer to the ageing attila engine , true , but creative assembly have made it look pretty damn good regardless . and if you’re worried that thrones of britannia might lack the scope of previous total war games such as rome or attila , which took in whole continents , then be assured that it’s sufficiently huge .', 'in fact , the british isles in this game is 23 times the size of the british isles featured in total war : attila , and for uk players there’s the added thrill of battling through humble and familiar towns like saint albans and dunbar . although , in a lovely touch , all of the places have been given their historical names , so london is lunden , manchester is mameceaster and leeds is loidis . the cutscenes also have a suitably historical feel , rendered like pages straight out of the anglo - saxon chronicle .', 'i particularly liked the factions menu , with its illustrated manuscript - style family portraits and detailed information about your lineage and retinue . it’s particularly useful as a place to find out who may be about to stab you in the back and make a grab for the throne – any nobles who end up with more influence than the regent need to be taken down a peg or two , and there are several fun ‘intrigue’ options which range from bad - mouthing them to full - on assassination . and it’s not just nobles you have to keep an eye on : your conquered territories are liable to be a bit rowdy and could rise up in civil war at any moment ( as my initial alfred found out to his cost ) . luckily , just like in real life , you can quieten them down by building taverns and churches .', 'the diplomacy options are pretty good fun , too . there’s a remarkable sense of satisfaction to be gained from building alliances and stoking resentment , teaming up with certain factions against others and eventually dominating smaller groups to the point where you can turn them into vassal states . in fact the whole thing is just enormous fun – i found whole hours just disappeared as i pored over the map and watched my empire grow , all soundtracked by some genuinely lovely period music . i’d usually play a strategy game like this with my own soundtrack blasting from the speakers , but those haunting pipes and drums were just too good to turn off .', 'it helps that the game regularly provides missions – these usually involve capturing certain territories or towns , and offer a sense of direction . having said that , you also have constant goals for a short victory ( if you want a shorter campaign ) and long victory , either of which can be achieved three ways : through gaining fame , conquering settlements , or controlling provinces . and if you achieve a long victory , there’s always the ultimate victory , which sees you fighting off a huge foreign invasion .', 'the various factions really give a different feel to each playthrough , so there’s huge scope for replayability here . the gwined faction is well - poised for a fame victory thanks to its unique bard building chain , whereas the viking sea kings get to go on expeditions to faraway lands and are perfectly equipped for terror - inducing raids on coastal towns .', 'the fact that i can’t wait to go back and play through the game again with each faction gives you an indication of just how moreish thrones of britannia is . plus , i need to do right by alfred and ensure that this time his destiny ends with him securing england’s future rather than face down in the dirt of kent .', 'clicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission .']"", '[""you \' ve come this far . . ."", ""the ds rendition has more bugs than yoda \' s swamp ."", ""we \' ve already established in previous reviews that the lego star wars series is a great , surprisingly fun franchise that extends the sci - fi epic into an unexpected direction . the console games , and to a lesser extent the game boy advance conversions of that design , offers a lot of solid and tight action based off of the immediately recognizable scenes from each of the film . lego star wars ii may be a sequel to last year \' s game that was based upon the prequel trilogy , but it \' s the first time that the game \' s been made for the nintendo ds handheld . and though the entire ds rendition pulls from the same excellent design that the consoles , pc , and psp systems are currently enjoying , it \' s absolutely riddled with bugs and glitches , and in many cases these bugs make some portions of the game - - mostly , the multiplayer aspect - - almost entirely unplayable ."", ""the idea of lego star wars ii is to present the theatrical movie scenes as action - based levels of blaster or light saber - wielding action , but in the form of lego block characters and environments . it \' s a goofy idea that \' s succeeded in an original design last year , and that game foundation has been built up for the original three star wars movies a new hope , empire strikes back , and return of the jedi . bringing it into the world of episode iv , v , and vi makes the concept even more awesome since the classic series is way , way more recognizable and offers much more for players to relate to . it \' s just inherently cooler in this universe : playing as luke skywalker in his progression as a jedi master , piloting an x - wing , tie fighter , or millennium falcon , or taking down at - at walkers with a tow cable is just much more awesome than anything episode i , ii , or iii ever offered ."", \'thrusting it all into the lego universe is just the icing on the cake because it gives the designers license to not take themselves seriously . these are goofy plastic toys , and it opens up a world of humor even if the action itself is straight - forward serious stuff . cutscenes break down the storyline into pantomimed animation from these single - jointed characterizations , and even when the plot takes its more dramatic direction , that drama is translated into goofiness that works .\', ""so we \' ve established that the concept is a great one , and on the playstation 2 , gamecube , xbox , xbox 360 , and pc the game design works . even in limited fashion the 2d -

That’s what the Total War Saga series is meant to explore, and Thrones of Britannia takes us back to a suitably fractious period in British history. Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia takes players back to 878 AD, a time where Britain and Ireland were still divided up by by vying rulers and their kingdoms, under the looming shadow of Viking invaders from the seas.\n\n\n\nAs a Brit, it’s a setting that speaks quite well to me, but it also takes me back to a period of time that I”m not particularly familiar with. I’m loosely aware of the fractious nature of the kingdoms in the British Isles, the way that the vacuum of Roman power was filled by the Anglo-Saxons, and obviously the Norman conquest that pivoted around the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The rest of my knowledge is a little hazy, but that gives Thrones of Britannia the opportunity to teach me some things. It’s cool to look at the map and see Lunden, Mameceaster, Snotingaham and other cities that continue today but with slightly different names – no, you won’t spot Milton Keynes on here.\n\n\n\nThe introductory videos for each faction also lays the historical foundations for you, rendered to look like gorgeous layered metalwork. Take on the role of King Alfred in West Seaxe – Wessex in modern English – and you’re in a position of great power with numerous vassal states, but also face the continuing threat of Viking Sea King invasions and the lingering resentment that the Great Viking Army have, having been forced to settle to the north east. You can obviously play as those two factions as well, or take on the role of the Welsh, Scots and Irish in this world, seeking to unite their fractured lands under one banner.\n\n\n\nWhile the campaign map is nowhere near the size of, say, Total War: Rome II or Total War: Warhammer, Creative Assembly have zoomed in and packed it full of smaller regions, provinces and settlements. It still feels like a fairly big map, though probably closer to some of the campaigns previously featured in Total War expansions. It plays well, however, and there’s a pace and fluidity inherent in its design. While major settlements have walls and can have huge holding garrisons, the smaller settlements within each province are less substantial than in other games. They often just have a single building to them and you can simply march through them to occupy or plunder, letting you choke a rival faction through pillaging before you attack their walls.\n\n\n\nBuilding your armies has been significantly altered for Thrones. Instead of simply buying a unit and then having it ready at full strength in your army, you’re instead presented with a depleted unit that has to muster over time while in friendly territory. It might take a good few turns before they’re at full strength, but the trade off is that you can recruit any of your unlocked units wherever you are and not just in a particular region, though each unit’s recruitment pool is limited and only replenishes gradually over time. With enough reserves of gold and food, you can quickly draw together an army at the maximum 20 units, especially with later tech tree unlocks.\n\n\n\nIn battle, things are kept relatively straight forward thanks to the limited variety in different troop types you can have and an emphasis on shield-based tactics of the day. Creating shield walls can defend from archers and javelins, as well as halt a cavalry charge, but they’re obviously weak to flanking. On standard difficulty, it’s fairly easy to roll over enemies, especially once you’ve unlocked more advanced versions of the handful of unit types.\n\n\n\nThe tech tree is now based around your actions and choices, as opposed to simply setting your smartest minds to ponder what a “longbow” or “catapult” is. If you want better spearmen, you need to recruit ten spearmen units to unlock their upgrade path, if you want siege weapons, you need to besiege five province capitals, and for certain civic upgrades, it’s about fully upgrading certain building types to unlock taverns, libraries, and so on.\n\n\n\nIt’s an approach that also works well with the simplified Noblemen system. Agents have been done away with, but you can assign characters to either lead your armies or govern a province. They now have three attributes of Heroism, Governance and Zeal that are improved by spending skill points in various categories, and these help boost certain aspects of their army and province management. The one thing you might have to be aware of is their loyalty to you and if they’re more influential than your leader, but there’s everything from rewarding them with country estates through to simple assassinations to keep these in check.\n\n\n\nEach faction has their own special features, like West Seaxe’s Witan council of nobles to propose policy changes, and there are certain narrative events that pop up that can be quite fun, such as an ambitious governor seeking to take on certain responsibilities that I slapped down. He responded by plotting against me with fake family trees and other equally devious schemes.\n\n\n\nHowever they could have made more of these moments. After a while, I simply learnt that I needed to hand over country estates and they’d get on with their jobs, and could happily ignore the missions pointing me to capture settlements halfway across the map. Diplomacy hasn’t really changed outside of now having arranged marriages to help improve relations. It’s still nigh on impossible, I find, to create vassal states until they’re about to make a last stand, which simply pushes me to war once more.\n\n\n\nAfter Total War: Warhammer II’s Great Vortex campaign, Thrones naturally has to step back to reality. The overriding goal is conquest and domination once more, but there’s a few differences in how you can go about this. You have the Conquest and Kingdom goals in both short and long forms, where you’re tasked with either ruling a certain number or particular set of provinces, but there’s also Fame. This allows you to be a little more benevolent and less bloodthirsty, seeking to grow your technology or capture certain settlements and important buildings for their fame boost. The short campaign goals provide you a convenient out after around 10-12 hours before the grind of conquering can set in, which is something I very much appreciate.\n\n\n\nWhile the way the game has been streamlined helps certain parts of the interface, the menus can still be a bit maze-like at times. Keeping a grip of the long list of noblemen in a sprawling kingdom would be tricky at the best of times, but your kingdom’s bloat is annoying when the start of your turn has pop ups that talk about characters you can’t remember, don’t tell you where they’re in charge of and don’t let you put them to one side to get an understanding of the situation. You’re forced to make a summary judgement with barely any facts.\n\n\n\nWhat’s Good:\n\n\n\nAn interesting period in British history\n\n\n\nMore diverse events and objectives\n\n\n\nRethought army mustering and tech trees\n\n\n\nNew Fame victory condition\n\n\n\nSnotingaham\n\n\n\nWhat’s Bad:\n\n\n\nDoes little to improve diplomacy\n\n\n\nStill generally boils down to conquering all before you\n\n\n\nEvent pop ups without enough context\n\n\n\nWhile Total War has often focussed on the big picture, Thrones of Britannia shows there’s plenty of scope for a series of Total War Saga offshoots to explore the smaller conflicts and civil wars through history. It’s also a great place for Creative Assembly to experiment with gameplay, and the changes to recruitment, tech trees and story elements give us a glimpse of what the series might hold in future.\n\n\n\nScore: 8/10\n\n\n\nRead more: # Creative Assembly # Total War # Total War Saga: Thrones Of Britannia\n\n\n\nComments are closed.\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\n\nInterview: Exploring Ancient China In Total War: Three Kingdoms\n\n\n\nCheck Out The Gorgeous Campaign Map From Total War: Three Kingdoms\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\n\nTotal War Saga: Thrones Of Britannia Gets A Launch Trailer\n\n\n\nApril\n\n\n\nTotal War Saga: Thrones Of Britannia Review\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\n\nThe Welsh Get A Cinematic Trailer For A Total War Saga: Thrones Of Britannia\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\n\nHands On Team Strategy And War Elephants In Total War: Arena’s Open Beta\n\n\n\nTotal War: Arena Enters Open Beta This Month, Five Years Since Its Announcement\n\n\n\nJanuary\n\n\n\nTotal War: Warhammer II – Rise of the Tomb Kings DLC Review\n\n\n\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms Announced For Release In Fall 2018\n\n\n\nDecember\n\n\n\nPlay With Gravity & Giant Units In Total War: Warhammer II’s Free ‘The Laboratory’ Mode\n\n\n\nSomething For The Weekend – 15/09/18\n\n\n\n1 day ago\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nThe News At Sixth: 14/09/18\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nWhat We Played #364 – Black Ops 4, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider & Labo\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\nYou Will Need To Connect To The Internet Once A Week To Play NES Games On Switch\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nAbsolver\'s Free Downfall DLC Launches Later This Month\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nBethesda Confirm Wolfenstein III Will Be A Thing\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nNickelodeon Kart Racers Announced For Consoles\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nPlayStation Asia Lists ""Crash Bandicoot Racing"" On Survey\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nAssassin\'s Creed Odyssey Is Coming To Switch In Japan Via The Cloud\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nCapcom Beat \'Em Up Bundle Knocks Seven Retro Classics Together Next Week\n\n\n\n2 days ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nLatest Comments\n\n\n\nMrYd on Something For The Weekend – 15/09/18\n\n\n\nAndrewww on Something For The Weekend – 15/09/18\n\n\n\nJR. on What We Played #364 – Black Ops 4, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider & Labo\n\n\n\nCrazy_Del on Something For The Weekend – 15/09/18\n\n\n\nron_mcphatty on What We Played #364 – Black Ops 4, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider & Labo\n\n\n\nJag on What We Played #364 – Black Ops 4, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider & Labo\n\n\n\nStefan L on Black Ops 4’s Blackout Mode Is A Damn Good Battle Royale\n\n\n\nAndrewww on What We Played #364 – Black Ops 4, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider & Labo\n\n\n\nPixel_nme on What We Played #364 – Black Ops 4, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider & Labo\n\n\n\nCrazy_Del on What We Played #364 – Black Ops 4, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider & Labo\n\n\n\nron_mcphatty on What We Played #364 – Black Ops 4, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider & Labo\n\n\n\nPixel_nme on Black Ops 4’s Blackout Mode Is A Damn Good Battle Royale\n\n\n\nthesixthaxis - an oscar mike media joint\n\n\n\nWe do not license content or design to any other site.

Starting off in 878 AD, Thrones of Britannia sees Alfred the Great on a quest to push back against a Viking invasion from the North East, with the aim of unifying the land under the banner of the Anglo-Saxons. Admittedly, my clumsy first attempt at controlling the great monarch saw him perish within two years, Wessex fall into civil war, and my armies starve, but the point still stands.\n\n\n\nAlfred’s story is just one of many you can potentially screw up: the game gives you the option to play as ten factions, each with different alliances, strengths, and objectives. For instance, you could opt to play as the Welsh king Anaraut on a mission to unite Wales, the Irish king Flann on a quest to become High King of Ireland, or the Scottish king Aed as he attempts to repel rival clans and resist the Viking invaders. And if you’re not feeling particularly patriotic you could even play as the Viking invaders themselves, seeking to subjugate Britain under the sharp end of an axe.\n\n\n\nGameplay follows the usual Total War template, with two different modes: a map view in which you can move your armies, construct buildings, research technology, and engage in diplomacy; and a battle view in which you conduct your army during a fight. As ever, the scale and complexity of the skirmishes is impressive, as you carefully manoeuvre up to 20 different troop units into strategic positions, attempting to outflank the enemy or slam a humiliating cavalry charge from the rear. The ability to zoom seamlessly from a bird’s eye view right down to the eye level of individual fighters still amazes even after all these years.\n\n\n\nLaying siege to a provincial capital also makes a refreshing change from the regular battles – catapults are a rare, late-game unit, so sieges are now protracted, bloody affairs defined by rams and siege towers. A great variety of settlement maps, some of which are based directly on their historical layouts, also ensures that no two such undertakings feel quite the same.\n\n\n\nWyrd up\n\n\n\nThrones of Britannia follows hot on the hooves, claws, and wings of Total War: Warhammer II, another hugely successful spin-off. While Britannia’s achievement is finding focus in the form of a single island, Warhammer II does the opposite - amplifying Total War like never before. The series has traditionally stumbled when going large, which makes this victory all the sweeter.\n\n\n\nTotal War: Warhammer 2 PC review\n\n\n\nBattles are also slower than in recent Total Wars – certainly Warhammer – as Creative Assembly aim to simulate the tactics of the day: if infantry have shields, they’ll default to fighting in a shieldwall formation, and can protect against missiles with a shield castle. This makes them very resilient as frontline infantry go, especially since heavy cavalry are rare, leaving two-handed infantry as most armies’ typical shock troops. Most battles are about keeping those shock troops alive long enough to bring them to bear (lacking shields, they’re much more vulnerable to missile fire), or trying to win an advantage on the flanks with skirmishers. It’s a tense, drawn-out business.\n\n\n\nImpressive as it all is, I found that I rarely used the battle view in the course of play. As in previous entries to the series, every time you engage with an enemy army, there’s an option to have the AI instantly take care of the battle for you – and as long as you outnumber the enemy, you’re pretty much guaranteed a welcome outcome. The only times I stepped in to play a battle manually were occasions when I was attacked by an army of equal or greater force, in the hope that a few cunning tactics might tip the battle in my favour. In the campaign at least, battles are more of a side show – the meat of the game is in the map and the menus.\n\n\n\nLuckily the map itself is a thing of beauty, alive with rippling grass, criss-crossing caravans, and Viking longships harassing the coast. It’s jarring to return from Warhammer to the ageing Attila engine, true, but Creative Assembly have made it look pretty damn good regardless. And if you’re worried that Thrones of Britannia might lack the scope of previous Total War games such as Rome or Attila, which took in whole continents, then be assured that it’s sufficiently huge.\n\n\n\nThere’s a remarkable sense of satisfaction to be gained from building alliances and stoking resentment\n\n\n\nIn fact, the British Isles in this game is 23 times the size of the British Isles featured in Total War: Attila, and for UK players there’s the added thrill of battling through humble and familiar towns like Saint Albans and Dunbar. Although, in a lovely touch, all of the places have been given their historical names, so London is Lunden, Manchester is Mameceaster and Leeds is Loidis. The cutscenes also have a suitably historical feel, rendered like pages straight out of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle .\n\n\n\nI particularly liked the factions menu, with its illustrated manuscript-style family portraits and detailed information about your lineage and retinue. It’s particularly useful as a place to find out who may be about to stab you in the back and make a grab for the throne – any nobles who end up with more influence than the regent need to be taken down a peg or two, and there are several fun ‘intrigue’ options which range from bad-mouthing them to full-on assassination. And it’s not just nobles you have to keep an eye on: your conquered territories are liable to be a bit rowdy and could rise up in civil war at any moment (as my initial Alfred found out to his cost). Luckily, just like in real life, you can quieten them down by building taverns and churches.\n\n\n\nThe diplomacy options are pretty good fun, too. There’s a remarkable sense of satisfaction to be gained from building alliances and stoking resentment, teaming up with certain factions against others and eventually dominating smaller groups to the point where you can turn them into vassal states. In fact the whole thing is just enormous fun – I found whole hours just disappeared as I pored over the map and watched my empire grow, all soundtracked by some genuinely lovely period music. I’d usually play a strategy game like this with my own soundtrack blasting from the speakers, but those haunting pipes and drums were just too good to turn off.\n\n\n\nIt helps that the game regularly provides missions – these usually involve capturing certain territories or towns, and offer a sense of direction. Having said that, you also have constant goals for a Short Victory (if you want a shorter campaign) and Long Victory, either of which can be achieved three ways: through gaining fame, conquering settlements, or controlling provinces. And if you achieve a Long Victory, there’s always the Ultimate Victory, which sees you fighting off a huge foreign invasion.\n\n\n\nThe various factions really give a different feel to each playthrough, so there’s huge scope for replayability here. The Gwined faction is well-poised for a fame victory thanks to its unique Bard building chain, whereas the Viking Sea Kings get to go on expeditions to faraway lands and are perfectly equipped for terror-inducing raids on coastal towns.\n\n\n\nTotal War: Thrones of Britannia PC review\n\n\n\nThe fact that I can’t wait to go back and play through the game again with each faction gives you an indication of just how moreish Thrones of Britannia is. Plus, I need to do right by Alfred and ensure that this time his destiny ends with him securing England’s future rather than face down in the dirt of Kent.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nLewis Packwood\n\n\n\n137 days ago\n\n\n\nRead More Thrones of Britannia PC review Everything about Thrones of Britannia Thrones of Britannia gameplay preview\n\n\n\nBuy Now\n\n\n\nA Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia\n\n\n\nStrategy\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\n\nClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.\n\n\n\nPromoted\n\n\n\nHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system\n\n\n\n7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScape\n\n\n\nWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n© 2018\n\n\n\nPowered by Network-N\n\n\n\nTerms and conditions\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\n\nCareers"", 'doctype html\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II Review - IGN\n\n\n\nBrowse\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nVita\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nMovies\n\n\n\nTV\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\nComics\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nUpcoming\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nWikis + Cheats\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\n\nBoards\n\n\n\nTrailers\n\n\n\nIGN on YouTube\n\n\n\nIGN on Facebook\n\n\n\nIGN on Twitter\n\n\n\nMORE\n\n\n\nBrowse\n\n\n\nShows\n\n\n\nMonday through Friday\n\n\n\nDaily Fix\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch Online FINALLY Gets a Date\n\n\n\nplay latest\n\n\n\nDaily Fix\n\n\n\nPrepare To Try\n\n\n\nHotKeys\n\n\n\nUp At Noon\n\n\n\nGame Scoop!\n\n\n\nBeyond!\n\n\n\nNintendo Voice Chat\n\n\n\nUnlocked\n\n\n\nmore shows\n\n\n\nFireteam Chat\n\n\n\nIGN Every Ever\n\n\n\nLinked Together\n\n\n\nIGN Spotlight\n\n\n\nIGN Unfiltered\n\n\n\nIGN Access\n\n\n\nIGN Plays\n\n\n\nEvery Thrs\n\n\n\nGame Scoop!\n\n\n\nGame Scoop\'s Take on Spider-Man PS4\n\n\n\nplay latest\n\n\n\nNew episodes every Saturday.\n\n\n\nPrepare To Try\n\n\n\nSave Solaire - Fighting Gwyn - Part 7\n\n\n\nplay latest\n\n\n\nEvery Friday\n\n\n\nNintendo Voice Chat\n\n\n\nOur Favorite New Switch Games This Week- NVC Highlight\n\n\n\nplay latest\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\n\nMovies\n\n\n\nTV\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\nEsports\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\nYou\'ve Come This Far...\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\nIGN\n\n\n\nus\n\n\n\nBig Story\n\n\n\nNew iPhone Models Revealed\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nFrozen Synapse 2 Review\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II Review\n\n\n\nTrending Today\n\n\n\nFrozen Synapse 2 Review\n\n\n\nNBA 2K19 Review\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider Review\n\n\n\nNBA Live 19 Review\n\n\n\nTwo Point Hospital Review\n\n\n\nMarvel\'s Spider-Man PS4 Review\n\n\n\nDivinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition Review\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter Generations Ultimate Review\n\n\n\nFar Cry 5: Dead Living Zombies DLC Review\n\n\n\nThe Messenger Review\n\n\n\nDragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age Review\n\n\n\nPES 2019 Review\n\n\n\nStrange Brigade Review\n\n\n\nDonut County Review\n\n\n\nWorld of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth Review\n\n\n\nInnerSpace Review\n\n\n\nDeath\'s Gambit Review\n\n\n\nNintendo Labo Variety Kit Review\n\n\n\nF1 2018 Review\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nReviewed on NDS\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n18 Sep 2006 3:39 PM PDT\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II\n\n\n\nReview\n\n\n\nShare.\n\n\n\nThe DS rendition has more bugs than Yoda\'s swamp.\n\n\n\nBy Craig Harris\n\n\n\nWe\'ve already established in previous reviews that the LEGO Star Wars series is a great, surprisingly fun franchise that extends the sci-fi epic into an unexpected direction. The console games, and to a lesser extent the Game Boy Advance conversions of that design, offers a lot of solid and tight action based off of the immediately recognizable scenes from each of the film. LEGO Star Wars II may be a sequel to last year\'s game that was based upon the prequel trilogy, but it\'s the first time that the game\'s been made for the Nintendo DS handheld. And though the entire DS rendition pulls from the same excellent design that the consoles, PC, and PSP systems are currently enjoying, it\'s absolutely riddled with bugs and glitches, and in many cases these bugs make some portions of the game -- mostly, the multiplayer aspect -- almost entirely unplayable.\n\n\n\nThe idea of LEGO Star Wars II is to present the theatrical movie scenes as action-based levels of blaster or light saber-wielding action, but in the form of LEGO block characters and environments. It\'s a goofy idea that\'s succeeded in an original design last year, and that game foundation has been built up for the original three Star Wars movies A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. Bringing it into the world of Episode IV, V, and VI makes the concept even more awesome since the classic series is way, way more recognizable and offers much more for players to relate to. It\'s just inherently cooler in this universe: playing as Luke Skywalker in his progression as a Jedi master, piloting an X-Wing, Tie Fighter, or Millennium Falcon, or taking down AT-AT walkers with a tow cable is just much more awesome than anything Episode I, II, or III ever offered.\n\n\n\nThrusting it all into the LEGO universe is just the icing on the cake because it gives the designers license to not take themselves seriously. These are goofy plastic toys, and it opens up a world of humor even if the action itself is straight-forward serious stuff. Cutscenes break down the storyline into pantomimed animation from these single-jointed characterizations, and even when the plot takes its more dramatic direction, that drama is translated into goofiness that works.\n\n\n\nSo we\'ve established that the concept is a great one, and on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PC the game design works. Even in limited fashion the 2D-ized Game Boy Advance rendition did a decent job working that concept into its limitations. And had the DS version received the same attention to development detail as the console versions everything would be peachy. But it\'s not.\n\n\n\nOh, it starts out promising enough: the same 3D graphics of the console game have been ported over to the not-quite-as-powerful DS hardware, as has the familiar Star Wars soundtrack and audio effects to supplement the action. This handheld version has the same huge assortment of available and unlockable characters, as well as the cool ""Create a Character"" mode. There\'s even the ""jump in at any time"" co-op mode through the Nintendo DS system\'s wireless connectivity feature. And even though many of the cutscenes of the console games have been abridged or removed, they\'re still there in some fashion offering a taste of the humor of the original design.\n\n\n\nBut then things start straying in a direction that tells us that this game was rushed out the door. The camera system, admittedly one of the weaker elements of the console design, is handled horrendously on the Nintendo DS platform -- half the time it works as it\'s intended, but in that other half it\'ll get stuck or move too slowly, or not get close enough to the action to see gaps properly. Environments and characters will simply vanish off screen an obscene amount of times throughout the experience; you\'ll be walking along when suddenly ""poof!"" There goes the backdrop. There goes Han Solo. There goes your X-Wing or the asteroids you\'re flying around. It happens so much that I wouldn\'t be surprised that people will think their copy is defective. When we played it for review we tested it on multiple retail copies, on multiple games. This game is riddled with bugs and it\'s entirely unacceptable to find this many in a final retail product that can\'t even be patched with a post-release download.\n\n\n\nThe worst glitch culprit is the sloppily handled multiplayer aspect. The cooperative mode understandably requires a copy for each of the two systems linked together, but it enables one player to play through his own story mode and opt to turn on the Wireless function to let someone else control the second character that\'s tagging along by default. But when we tested this we couldn\'t play it for more than three minutes without a system lock-up. Ditto for the four-player single cartridge deathmatch: a good idea, but either it wasn\'t tested or simply given the thumbs up after a single minute of play -- lock-ups occurred almost every time we tried to duke it out in this mode.\n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\nIf you can play from the ""see no evil"" perspective, you\'ll probably get a kick out of the Nintendo DS rendition of LEGO Star Wars II. It has some of the same clever puzzles and Stormtrooper-blasting, Tie Fighter-exploding, AT-AT Walker-toppling action of the bigger systems. But the fact that this game\'s riddled with bugs and that the developer, the publisher, and Nintendo\'s quality control let this game through is entirely unacceptable.\n\n\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nReleased Sep. 12th, 2006\n\n\n\nPS2 Xbox 360 PSP Xbox\n\n\n\nCell\n\n\n\nNDS\n\n\n\nGBA\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nGCN\n\n\n\nAwful\n\n\n\n18 Sep 2006\n\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nRead our review standards\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nPresentation\n\n\n\nIt\'s the console game all right.

All rights reserved. England and Wales company registration number 2008885.']",2006-09-12,"Lego Star Wars II's gameplay is from a third-person perspective, and takes place in a 3D game world that contains objects, environments and characters designed to resemble Lego pieces. Its gameplay—a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005). While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs – small, disk-shaped objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available.

Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities.  This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the ""Use Old Save"" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data.Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley Cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible. Entering two cheat codes, publicized by IGN, makes pieces for a Santa Claus character available. The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used (for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name ""Darth-3PO""); alternately, the player may create a name.",Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars_II:_The_Original_Trilogy

solving and the occasional platform - jumping . the size of your group expands and contracts regularly , growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times . you control only one character at a time , and you can switch characters easily on the fly . your artificial intelligence - controlled companions are pretty worthless , save for a few specific scripted sequences . there \' s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters , which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed . usually , though , the characters you \' re dragging around are there for a reason , as there are several different classes of characters , each with unique abilities that you \' ll need to progress . jedi characters sport lightsabers , can perform double - jumps , and can use their force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment . regular hero characters like princess leia and han solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot . c3po and r2d2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment , and r2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances . short characters like jawas and ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas ."", ""these character classes were all in the original , though they \' ve been tweaked slightly . all nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of legos into usable devices , something that originally only jedi were capable of ; many blaster - wielding characters will now auto - dodge incoming blaster fire ; and most characters now have unique melee attacks - - it \' s great to watch chewie rip a stormtrooper \' s arms right out of their sockets or to see lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were ryu . not only do all these refinements make non - jedi characters more useful , they also lend the game a bit more personality . new to lego star wars ii are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters . since you \' ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode , you \' ll have to rely on special helmet machines , which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter . it \' s a fragile ruse , though , because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off . the bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators , which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects ."", ""lego star wars ii puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original . you \' ll happen upon small carts , landspeeders , and at - sts that you can pilot in the action adventure chapters , though there are also chapters dedicated to memorable sequences like destroying both of the death stars , fighting off imperial forces in your snowspeeder on hoth , and racing speeder bikes through the forests of endor . these dedicated vehicle chapters make the game feel more epic and break up the action nicely , but hoth has been done to death already , and some of the sequences aren \' t as visceral as you might like . this is due largely to a stiff camera , something that occasionally hampers the action adventure levels as well . the camera usually stays in a fixed position , and though you \' re allowed a little wiggle room , there are a few specific points where it \' s easy to get stuck because the path is obscured ."", ""there \' s no dedicated multiplayer component to lego star wars ii , though it does offer cooperative play , and at any point a second player can just jump right in . it works seamlessly and reduces the number of generally useless ai companions , but it \' s also disappointing that no version of lego star wars ii features online co - op . whether you \' re playing alone or with a friend , lego star wars ii is easy . as long as you \' re pointing in the general direction , blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own , and death is barely punished with a small loss of money . it should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around , but there \' s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back ."", ""once you play through a level in the story mode , you can play it again in free play mode , which gives you some control over which characters you \' ll play as , and you \' ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn \' t get to with the story mode characters . you \' ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game , but there are others that you \' ll need to purchase in the shop , and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original lego star wars , if it appeared on the system you \' re playing on . the free play mode also lets you use your own custom - made characters , which you can build using pieces of other playable characters . it doesn \' t effect the gameplay , but there \' s still something really funny about putting darth vader \' s head on princess leia \' s body when she \' s in her slave costume . several different types of collectibles , an unlockable series of bounty hunter missions , and time trial mode all help to create some good lasting value ."", \'though the game is appearing on no less than eight different platforms , most of these versions are virtually indistinguishable . featurewise , the gamecube , playstation 2 , xbox , xbox 360 , and pc versions of lego star wars ii are nearly identical , and the psp version is awfully close , though it takes a slightly different approach to certain unlockables , and it also has much more pronounced loading times . the current - gen console versions all look slightly better than the original lego star wars , while the pc version looks a bit better than those , since it can run at much higher resolutions . by default , the pc version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme , though it’s easily modified . there’s also gamepad support , and we found that a wired xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons .\', \'the character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations .\', ""the xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair , with better reflections , better explosions , and a cool lens - focus effect that makes objects too close to or too far from the camera appear slightly blurry . it \' s definitely the best - looking version , but it \' s also got a very minor frame rate problem that crops up when there are a lot of particle effects . the achievement points in the xbox 360 version are pretty well balanced . you’ll probably get almost 200 points just by playing through all three episodes , though there is also a string of achievements that require you to complete entire chapters without dying once , which in some cases is no small feat ."", ""regardless of the platform , though , the visuals have a ton of charm . getting to see recognizable lego pieces mingling with recognizable star wars characters and locales is just really endearing , and lego star wars ii does it quite well . a vast library of recognizable sound effects and that unshakably rousing john williams score make the experience feel that much more authentic , and even though there \' s no real voice acting in the game , some miming and appropriate - sounding mumbles make it apparent what \' s going on ."", ""as much fun as lego star wars ii is , it \' s unfortunate that it had to come second . some of the novelty of the gameplay , as well as the concept itself , isn \' t quite as potent as it was the first time around . the original star wars trilogy just seems more deserving of this nostalgic treatment than the prequels . still , anyone with even a sliver of nostalgia for star wars will find this to be a fun , good -

nine gold bricks are available . the vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina . as each vehicle is completed ( all ten minikits collected ) , it becomes available for play in a bonus level .

You know, the one that everyone likes.\n\n\n\nAs for that first excuse, the LEGO Star Wars games are more family games than pure kids\' games (and they\'re hardly ""dumb""). Sure, they\'re simple enough for a kid to pick up and enjoy, and a skilled player can plow through the main story mode in a few hours, but there\'s a lot more depth below the surface. Of course, you may have just missed out on the first game since it was never released on PSP and that\'s the only system you have. In that case,\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II\n\n\n\nhas you kind of covered there.\n\n\n\nFor the benefit of those who may not have noticed the\n\n\n\nmultiple recent previews of the game\n\n\n\n, here\'s what\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II\n\n\n\nis all about. It\'s based on the popular line of LEGO sets that are based on the popular movies. The game\'s story mode is split up into three parts, each one focusing on one of the original\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nfilms. Within each of these film-based sections, there are six stages.\n\n\n\nThe first time you play through each stage, the characters that you can control are dependent on the movie\'s storyline. When on the swamp world of Dagobah, for instance, you can only play as Luke, R2-D2 and Yoda since they were the only characters on that planet in\n\n\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\n\n\n. After completing each stage, you typically unlock new playable characters, including most of the enemies that you face in the game. Completed stages can then be revisited in Free Mode, which allows you to select whatever character you want to play as, and a party of other characters is automatically chosen to accompany you in the level.\n\n\n\nNext:\n\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n\n>>\n\n\n\nPage:\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nLatest Reviews\n\n\n\nGod of War: Ghost of Sparta Review\n\n\n\n(Nov 2, 2010)\n\n\n\nValkyria Chronicles II Review\n\n\n\n(Sep 3, 2010)\n\n\n\nThe Consensus: Tekken 6 PSP Review\n\n\n\n(Dec 7, 2009)\n\n\n\nThe Consensus: LittleBigPlanet PSP Review\n\n\n\n(Nov 18, 2009)\n\n\n\nThe Consensus: Assassin\'s Creed: Bloodlines Review\n\n\n\n(Nov 17, 2009)\n\n\n\n::\n\n\n\nMore Reviews...\n\n\n\nFollow GameSpy on Twitter\n\n\n\nGet the Latest in Gaming News\n\n\n\nAround the Network\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The... at IGN\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The...

Balancing just the right amount of irreverence and respect for the source material, the company has thus managed to expose new generations to the prose of England\'s most venerated playwright.\n\n\n\nThe works of George Lucas are perhaps only comparable to Shakespeare\'s in that they both employ words and actors, and, to be honest,\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nhas never been short of new generations to sell merchandise to – but nevertheless,\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nsucceeds with a similar remarkable transformation.\n\n\n\nIn this cracking new PSP incarnation, you\'ll whiz through the plots of this most popular series of modern science-fiction, taking charge of all of the mythology\'s treasured characters – but dressed in the diminutive clothing of Lego blocks.\n\n\n\nThus Luke, Leia, X-Wings, Ewoks, lightsabers, Yoda, and that most likeable of dark-helmeted heavy breathers are all cheekily and, erm, blockily represented (and, crucially, playable) as you race through the first trilogy\'s storylines scene by scene.\n\n\n\nThe game opens in the Mos Eisley Cantina, and from this hub you can access levels from all three episodes as well as visit the in-game store to purchase various bonus characters, secrets, tips and cheats with the money you\'ve collected.\n\n\n\nOnce inside the levels, the gameplay is a mixture of light puzzle solving, gentle platform gaming and the sabering up of dastardly Imperial troops.\n\n\n\nYou enter each stage with a modest team of playable characters of whom you only have control of one at a time (the AI handles the rest); switching between characters is as simple as a walking up to them and pressing Triangle.\n\n\n\nSwapping characters is crucial because they fall into different classes, each of which enjoys varying abilities. Some can use grappling hooks to reach high platforms, others have double jumps or can squeeze into impossibly tight spaces; some can open special doors and still others, such as favourite bleeping droid R2D2, can hover for a short while.\n\n\n\nThe game presents various tasks that can only be solved by the appropriate character and, through careful planning and teamwork, you progress the glorious story.\n\n\n\nYou\'re also allowed to destroy much of the scenery in order to harvest the game\'s currency, Lego money. Equally, if you\'re in a more constructive mood, you\'re able to build up piles of scattered Lego left around into useful items or vehicles.\n\n\n\nThere\'s a lot of running around, but not everything has to be done on foot, of course. Some levels switch to a traditional style space shoot-\'em-up that see you weaving through blocky space in the galaxy\'s most desirable ride, the Millennium Falcon, taking down TIE fighters or asteroids, or wrapping rope around the legs of AT-AT walkers. These stages are a welcome diversion from the main course, though they generally never feel quite as accomplished.\n\n\n\nOf course, as you\'d hope from the game version of supreme buddy movie\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\n, you needn\'t be all alone. Popular gamers can play cooperatively with a friend wirelessly – although, sadly, not over the internet.\n\n\n\nIn these multiplayer modes the gameplay and level designs are identical to those in the single-player experience (if a tad more frustrating, as the camera strains to keep you both in shot all the time) and either of you can drop out at any time, leaving the other able to continue battling the bad guys solo.\n\n\n\nGraphically,\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n\'s developer has worked miracles with this PSP version – it\'s near indistinguishable from the Xbox 360 console version save for the extended loading times. It\'s glorious to behold.\n\n\n\nTrue, there\'s a sense in which, underneath the accomplished visuals and the beloved scenario and characterisation, this is a simple videogame built on tried-and-tested mechanics – there\'s nothing particularly genre-defying or staggeringly notable in the game dynamic.\n\n\n\nThat said, it is exceptionally, ingeniously designed, and the gameplay is always extremely robust and compulsive. Overlaid with the striking\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nmythology and delightful Lego aesthetics, the simple game becomes a very compelling place to spend time.\n\n\n\nEven if you\'re sick of the\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nfranchise, there is a brilliantly pitched game underneath the setting that will spur you through. (Something that only makes our frustration with the\n\n\n\nlousy DS version\n\n\n\neven harder to stomach.)\n\n\n\nFor the Star Wars disciple – that player with themed bed sheets and an A-grade pristine boxed plastic Millennium Falcon weighing down the attic floor –\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nwill prove to be just about the best game they buy for their PSP.\n\n\n\nFor everyone else, it\'s \'simply\' excellent.\n\n\n\nWhat\'s this?\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nSimon Parkin | 17 November 2006\n\n\n\nFollow @SimonParkin\n\n\n\nBeautifully knitting together the Star Wars and Lego worlds in presentation and ambience, this is a game that showcases the PSP\'s extraordinary capabilities\n\n\n\nAbout our scores >>\n\n\n\nRate this game >>\n\n\n\nAverage reader score:\n\n\n\nPG Tips & Cheats\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\n\n\n\ncomments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\nFEATURE\n\n\n\nWant Free Games?\n\n\n\nRECENT COMMENTS\n\n\n\nApple Special Event 2018 - Liveblog | Feature\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nThe Switch\'s online service finally has a launch date | News - upcoming\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nProfessor Layton and the Curious Village is on its way to the west on iOS and Android | News - upcoming\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nHyper Light Drifter review - A beautiful yet punishing action RPG for Switch | Game review\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nPhantomgate and Spellsouls: two of the best mobile games you never played\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Blades has been pushed back to December on iOS and Android | News - upcoming\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nTropico for iPad still doesn\'t have a release date, but it does have a price now | News - upcoming\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nFortnite\'s Android installer was vulnerable to hackers and Epic\'s mad at Google for telling us | News\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nLATEST NEWS\n\n\n\nPocket Gamer is hiring a freelance Guides Editor!\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nWe want YOU to intern at Pocket Gamer\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nWe want YOU to write freelance guides for Pocket Gamer!\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nSteel Media says goodbye to PG\'s former Community Manager, Ray Wilmott\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\n[Update] Footage from canned PSP title The Elder Scrolls Travels: Oblivion emerges\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nLATEST VIDEOS\n\n\n\nLaunch trailer for Class of Heroes II\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nSee how Sony revolutionized portable gaming with the PSP and the PS Vita\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nJetpack Joyride whizzing onto PSP and Vita this week\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo sprints, shoots, and scowls in trailer for PES 2013\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nTake farting to a whole new level\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nNEWS\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nPREVIEWS\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nVIDEOS\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nWALKTHROUGHS\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nA-Z\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nHOW TO\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nBEST GAMES\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nHARDWARE\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nTIPS\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nBIG INDIE PITCH\n\n\n\n© Steel Media Limited | Terms and conditions | About us | Advertise with us | Contact us | Privacy policy | Hosted by Games Press Ltd.', ""doctype html\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II | Modojo\n\n\n\n\uea66\n\n\n\n\ued69\n\n\n\nDiscover\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nGuides\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nAccessories\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n\nIndustry\n\n\n\n\ueb30\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\n\niPhone\n\n\n\niPad\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\n\nSwitch\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nVita\n\n\n\nWearables\n\n\n\nDrones\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\n\uea97\n\n\n\n\ueb81\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\ueb98\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\ueb9e\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\ueb90\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\uedc3\n\n\n\nRobert Falcon\n\n\n\npsp\n\n\n\npreview\n\n\n\nPublished\n\n\n\nAugust 11, 2006 6:32 AM\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II\n\n\n\nAwesome preview of this game we have. Read it, you will.\n\n\n\nA long time ago, in a galaxy far, far...nah, you know what? I'm not going to start this preview with a Star Wars quote. Everyone usually does that so I'll take a different route and just talk about the game legacy that is Lego Star Wars . Inspired by the toy line that came out a few years ago, Travellers Tales has since crafted it into a game formula that actually works better than typical Star Wars games. The first Lego game was a hit across consoles, courtesy of Eidos Interactive, and now LucasArts has stepped up for the sequel, Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy . And this time, the PSP gets some love, as a version is coming its way.\n\n\n\nThe game follows the storyline of the first three movies- A New Hope , The Empire Strikes Back , and Return of the Jedi . You'll take control of a number of different characters, including Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and others as you fight off the evil Empire and the insidious Darth Vader. Throughout the game, you'll find plenty of combat with Stormtroopers and other enemies, as well as vehicular stages and other bonus goodies to keep the gameplay pretty steady.\n\n\n\nThe PSP version looks to be shaping up pretty well thus far. The game moves at 60 frames per second and looks to have the same level of detail as the console effort, although the screen is slightly scrunched so all the action can fit on the wide PSP display. This is pretty forgivable, however, and the game still looks like a winner. Sound-wise, you'll encounter plenty of old-school Star Wars effects, like Chewbacca's maddening howl, the buzzing of the lightsabers, and the classic blaster noises. John Williams' music will also take center stage so that you really feel like you're in the middle of a Star Wars product.\n\n\n\nThere are a few cool things worth mentioning. As you go through the game, you can actually work on customization features, so you can build your own weird little characters for the game. Like giving a character Yoda's head and a Stormtrooper's body. Or having the gall to take Princess Leia's Jabba slave body and putting C-3PO's head on it. This sort of wild and wacky customization should add a little oomph to the game, as well as a bit more comic relief. If that's not enough, the game will also support co-op play over WiFi, so a second player can come in and take part in the action as they make their way through a stage. Bonus mini-games and other goodies can also be unlocked over the course of the game.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy should also have the same great gameplay as the original. Part of what made the first game so special is the fact that its gameplay was relatively easy to get into, but very addictive in terms of platforming action. Different characters come into play to unlock doors, reach platforms, and having unique attack methods to get things done. Here, you'll be taking control of a number of characters, ranging from Obi Wan Kenobi to heroic pilots to Ewoks. Yup, Ewoks.

It was a curious combination, but it worked because the gameplay was novel enough, the combined nostalgia for Star Wars and Legos was potent, and the experience was delivered with a humorous, lighthearted flair. Lego Star Wars II is an even better package than the original, due almost entirely to the fact that the emotional connection to A New Hope , Empire Strikes Back , and Return of the Jedi is much stronger for most people.\n\n\n\nIt works best as a nostalgia piece, but Lego Star Wars II is good fun on its own.\n\n\n\nYou start out in the Mos Eisley Cantina, which serves as a hub from which you can access all three episodes, as well as a counter where you can purchase extras like cheats and additional playable characters, and a new character creation counter. Initially you\'ll have access only to A New Hope, though you\'ll gain access to Empire and Jedi after beating the first chapter. The game hits nearly all of the most memorable sequences from all three films, and it does it all with a goofy sense of humor. Since the game will no doubt attract some hardcore Star Wars fans, it\'s also worth noting that Lego Star Wars II seems to be taking most of its cues from the original theatrical releases. This means you can expect Han to shoot first, Darth Vader to have eyebrows, and Return of the Jedi to end with the classic ""Yub Yub"" Ewok song. They\'re all minor points, but it\'s the kind of stuff that fans will definitely appreciate.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II is still primarily an action adventure game in which you control a group of characters as they blast their way through enemies and do some light puzzle-solving and the occasional platform-jumping. The size of your group expands and contracts regularly, growing as large as seven characters and shrinking down to a mere two characters at times. You control only one character at a time, and you can switch characters easily on the fly. Your artificial intelligence-controlled companions are pretty worthless, save for a few specific scripted sequences. There\'s also a small loophole where enemies rarely target droid characters, which makes it easy to walk right through certain areas unscathed. Usually, though, the characters you\'re dragging around are there for a reason, as there are several different classes of characters, each with unique abilities that you\'ll need to progress. Jedi characters sport lightsabers, can perform double-jumps, and can use their Force powers to manipulate certain objects in the environment. Regular hero characters like Princess Leia and Han Solo pack blasters and can use special grappling hook points to reach areas other characters cannot. C3PO and R2D2 can open special doors and activate certain equipment, and R2 has the added bonus of being able to hover short distances. Short characters like Jawas and Ewoks can access special ducts that lead to otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n\n\nThese character classes were all in the original, though they\'ve been tweaked slightly. All nondroid characters are able to assemble random piles of Legos into usable devices, something that originally only Jedi were capable of; many blaster-wielding characters will now auto-dodge incoming blaster fire; and most characters now have unique melee attacks--it\'s great to watch Chewie rip a stormtrooper\'s arms right out of their sockets or to see Lando pull off a rising dragon punch as if he were Ryu. Not only do all these refinements make non-Jedi characters more useful, they also lend the game a bit more personality. New to Lego Star Wars II are doors that can be accessed only by stormtroopers or bounty hunters. Since you\'ll never have either in your party when playing in story mode, you\'ll have to rely on special helmet machines, which will give your character the appearance of either a storm trooper or a bounty hunter. It\'s a fragile ruse, though, because one shot from an enemy causes the helmet to fall off. The bounty hunter disguise also grants you the ability to toss out thermal detonators, which can be used to eliminate certain otherwise indestructible objects.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II puts a greater emphasis on vehicles than the original. You\'ll happen upon small carts, landspeeders, and AT-STs that you can pilot in the action adventure chapters, though there are also chapters dedicated to memorable sequences like destroying both of the Death Stars, fighting off imperial forces in your snowspeeder on Hoth, and racing speeder bikes through the forests of Endor. These dedicated vehicle chapters make the game feel more epic and break up the action nicely, but Hoth has been done to death already, and some of the sequences aren\'t as visceral as you might like. This is due largely to a stiff camera, something that occasionally hampers the action adventure levels as well. The camera usually stays in a fixed position, and though you\'re allowed a little wiggle room, there are a few specific points where it\'s easy to get stuck because the path is obscured.\n\n\n\nThere\'s no dedicated multiplayer component to Lego Star Wars II, though it does offer cooperative play, and at any point a second player can just jump right in. It works seamlessly and reduces the number of generally useless AI companions, but it\'s also disappointing that no version of Lego Star Wars II features online co-op. Whether you\'re playing alone or with a friend, Lego Star Wars II is easy. As long as you\'re pointing in the general direction, blaster fire has a way of finding enemies on its own, and death is barely punished with a small loss of money. It should probably take you around six hours to make your way through all three episodes the first time around, but there\'s plenty of additional content to keep you coming back.\n\n\n\nOnce you play through a level in the story mode, you can play it again in free play mode, which gives you some control over which characters you\'ll play as, and you\'ll find that each chapter is absolutely packed with secrets and areas that you simply couldn\'t get to with the story mode characters. You\'ll unlock plenty of additional characters simply by playing the game, but there are others that you\'ll need to purchase in the shop, and still others that you can unlock with a game save from the original Lego Star Wars, if it appeared on the system you\'re playing on. The free play mode also lets you use your own custom-made characters, which you can build using pieces of other playable characters. It doesn\'t effect the gameplay, but there\'s still something really funny about putting Darth Vader\'s head on Princess Leia\'s body when she\'s in her slave costume. Several different types of collectibles, an unlockable series of bounty hunter missions, and time trial mode all help to create some good lasting value.\n\n\n\nThough the game is appearing on no less than eight different platforms, most of these versions are virtually indistinguishable. Featurewise, the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PC versions of Lego Star Wars II are nearly identical, and the PSP version is awfully close, though it takes a slightly different approach to certain unlockables, and it also has much more pronounced loading times. The current-gen console versions all look slightly better than the original Lego Star Wars, while the PC version looks a bit better than those, since it can run at much higher resolutions. By default, the PC version implements a kind of goofy keyboard only control scheme, though it’s easily modified. There’s also gamepad support, and we found that a wired Xbox 360 controller automatically mapped all of the controls to the appropriate buttons.\n\n\n\nThe character creation system allows for some pretty comical combinations.\n\n\n\nThe Xbox 360 version has the most graphical flair, with better reflections, better explosions, and a cool lens-focus effect that makes objects too close to or too far from the camera appear slightly blurry. It\'s definitely the best-looking version, but it\'s also got a very minor frame rate problem that crops up when there are a lot of particle effects. The achievement points in the Xbox 360 version are pretty well balanced. You’ll probably get almost 200 points just by playing through all three episodes, though there is also a string of achievements that require you to complete entire chapters without dying once, which in some cases is no small feat.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the platform, though, the visuals have a ton of charm. Getting to see recognizable Lego pieces mingling with recognizable Star Wars characters and locales is just really endearing, and Lego Star Wars II does it quite well. A vast library of recognizable sound effects and that unshakably rousing John Williams score make the experience feel that much more authentic, and even though there\'s no real voice acting in the game, some miming and appropriate-sounding mumbles make it apparent what\'s going on.\n\n\n\nAs much fun as Lego Star Wars II is, it\'s unfortunate that it had to come second. Some of the novelty of the gameplay, as well as the concept itself, isn\'t quite as potent as it was the first time around. The original Star Wars trilogy just seems more deserving of this nostalgic treatment than the prequels. Still, anyone with even a sliver of nostalgia for Star Wars will find this to be a fun, good-natured romp.\n\n\n\nUpvote\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nView Comments (0)\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\nFun use of both the <i>Star Wars</i> and Lego licenses\n\n\n\nSeamless co-op play\n\n\n\nLonger, more challenging than predecessor\n\n\n\nMore vehicle sequences give better variety\n\n\n\nLoads of unlockable content\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nCamera occasionally obscures the action\n\n\n\nNo online co-op\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\nAbout GameSpot\'s Reviews\n\n\n\nOther Platform Reviews for Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\nDS /\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nXbox 360 /\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nRyan Davis\n\n\n\nMore GameSpot Reviews\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA 2K19 Review - Another Year, Another Baller\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nShadow Of The Tomb Raider Review - Guerilla Girl\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nValkyria Chronicles 4 Review - Soar High\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNBA Live 19 Review -- Dribbling Forward\n\n\n\nLoad Comments (0)\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\n\n%gameName%\n\n\n\nGet the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.\n\n\n\nYou\'re Good to Go!\n\n\n\nWe\'ll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.\n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n\nFirst Released\n\n\n\nSep 12, 2006\n\n\n\nreleased\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n\nGame Boy Advance\n\n\n\n+ 8 more\n\n\n\nGameCube\n\n\n\nMacintosh\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPlayStation 2\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy has you controlling LEGO versions of the original Star Wars heroes.\n\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n\nAverage Rating\n\n\n\n10920 Rating(s)\n\n\n\nPlease\n\n\n\nSign In\n\n\n\nto rate\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nDeveloped by:\n\n\n\nAmaze Entertainment\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTraveller\'s Tales\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nRobosoft Technologies\n\n\n\nPublished by:\n\n\n\nLucasArts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nElectronic Arts\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nFeral Interactive\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nTHQ Wireless\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nActivision\n\n\n\nGenre(s):\n\n\n\nAdventure\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nTheme(s):\n\n\n\nSci-Fi\n\n\n\nEveryone 10+ Cartoon Violence, Crude Humor\n\n\n\n© 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

Its gameplay—a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005). While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs – small, disk-shaped objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.



=== Playable characters ===



Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities.  This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the ""Use Old Save"" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data.Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley Cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible. Entering two cheat codes, publicized by IGN, makes pieces for a Santa Claus character available. The game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used (for example, a character made from pieces of Darth Vader and C-3PO might have the name ""Darth-3PO""); alternately, the player may create a name.",Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars_II:_The_Original_Trilogy

paced game comes to life with players applying pressure d , diving on loose balls , and throwing it down against rival schools .\', ""in college , there are several things that students do : drink , study like there \' s no tomorrow , and show their enormous college pride . the massive cheering and stomping that occurs at home team sports events can be compared to a monstrous earthquake . when an incredible athletic feat transpires , the richter scale may be unable to measure the caliber of the ensuing commotion . yes , all of this excitement can be found at a local college basketball game ."", ""ncaa march madness is a college basketball game with over 320 schools from which to choose . it \' s the third game of the ea franchise on the ps2 , and the game play has improved in several key areas , but with this installment , does ea maintain its reputation for being the # 1 selling college basketball franchise ?"", ""if you have played the older ncaa basketball games , you will notice that this title \' s game play has been completely revamped . i have personally played last year \' s ncaa , and i noticed a major problem : it was way too easy to take the rock to the hole , making the game feel totally unrealistic . for example , you never had to wait for an opening to pass the ball , and regardless of the accuracy of the pass , your teammate would still get it . this , my friends , is the area that was revamped . not only is it harder to score , but you can \' t just randomly throw up a pass and hope that it will reach your teammate . lurking hands will be swinging around in the air , hoping to deflect the pass and lead to a fast break , perhaps the second most embarrassing way to get scored on ( the first is breaking the opponents \' ankles by beating them to the hole ) . while the developers have completely changed the easiest sports games into the most advanced and incredibly complicated games to pick up , the plus side is that the games have a lot more replay value ."", \'the available modes for the game are : season , dynasty , mascot , rivalry , tournament , practice , and lastly , online . the main mode of play is either season or dynasty . in season mode , you play only one season of games , while in dynasty , you play through 10 years . i would personally choose dynasty because you have more options and control over your team . you get to set your schedule , train , cut players , recruit before the season starts , and even partake in a session of roundball classic , where you play with the best 20 high school seniors for fun and possibly even recruit them . there is also a "" play now "" option , which lets you dive right into a game without any fuss or planning .\', ""the developers have implemented something similar to madden \' s progression to this game as well . in madden , the player progresses in two fields during the year in regular season and training in the off - season . in ncaa , i have only noticed improvements when you train the team in the off - season . training for ncaa is very different from madden \' s training . if you played madden 2004 , you will know that in order to train your team in the off - season , you have to train them yourself . in ncaa , you preset your team \' s training conditions , and it is completely automated , although i really wish that you could take the player into practice yourself . another thing i would have loved to see is the team practicing when it does not have any games for which to prepare . in real life , these college players \' lives revolve around basketball , and they are constantly practicing to improve and ensure victory over school rivals ."", ""to cope with the school rivalries , the developers have implemented two separate modes : mascot and rival matches . the mascot matches are probably one of the most interesting to watch , but that \' s not necessarily a good thing . it looks like dolls are out on the basketball court trying to bust out their moves against one another . how would you react to seeing stanford \' s entire team dressed up as trees , facing off against syracuse \' s team , dressed up as orange m & ms ( orangemen ) ? you just can \' t help but think that it looks so wrong . if you are with me on this , you should head over to the rivalry matches , where ea has set up a decent amount of rivalry - filled matchups , like ucla vs . usc , stanford vs . cal , and many more . the only setback is that some schools are complicated and don \' t have just one rival , and these other matches were not implemented . while it would have been nice , all the possible rivalries among so many schools would have been quite the hassle ."", ""i attend uc santa barbara so naturally , my first task at hand was to find my team . imagine my surprise when i found uc santa bill instead , but apparently , the ncaa doesn \' t have permission to use some school names and mascots , and my school was among this bunch . because of this , some schools won \' t have mascots , correct names , and sometimes , aren \' t even placed in the correct league . i guess licensing issues are always a pain to deal with , and i truly hope that they get more into their next installment ."", ""the in - game play is truly impressive . the game is not the easiest one to pick up , and you will need to learn and understand the key configurations and memorize them . unlike the older ncaa games , schooling or breaking the opponent \' s ankle is quite hard ( juke , faking out , getting beat ) . to control the ball , ea has implemented the freestyle controls , and something this good is not developed overnight so i wonder how long this idea has been hiding up their sleeves . freestyle is done by using the right analog stick , and it feels like the ball is really in your hand . move the right analog stick from left to right to dribble from your left hand to the right hand for a cross over , hit forward to spin , and lastly , you can do a delay on holding the ball on a certain hand . other moves that are important to offense are the low post moves , which let you back down as well as pull off the fade away jump shots ."", ""offense isn \' t the only place that the freestyle is in use ; ea has also implemented this on the defensive side . you can use the freestyle to steal , defensive crouch , hands up , and lastly , off - ball switch . this makes stealing the ball a lot easier , and you don \' t need to use many of the other keys , unless you prefer them . another important thing to learn is to change defense formations by hitting the four directions on the digital pad . formations usually range from double team all the way to full court press ."", ""the basketball courts are pretty detailed , and i don \' t know if the courts were modeled after their real - life counterparts , but the syracuse court is simply stunning . as for the teams for which the ncaa doesn \' t have licensing rights , i couldn \' t find any noticeable differences to set one court apart from another . the best way to see the stadium is to go through the four different views : baseline low , press box , baseline high , and sideline . the one i personally prefer is the default view , baseline low , because it gives you the perspective necessary to win games . the graphics of the characters are nice but far from awing . since i don \' t follow the ncaa that closely , i can \' t really say that the character faces match the players , but overall , the graphics are nice ."", ""the music in the game isn \' t all that great but extremely well thought - out . as we college students know , wherever there is a game , there is a band . rather than having any of the upbeat music you hear in their other franchise titles , the developers used band music , which is very fitting for the game . another sound that fits the game quite well is the cheering from the crowd . we know how hectic the home games are , and boy did they implement that well . the only sound portion that i am really annoyed with is the voice of an overly enthusiastic announcer ; his comments are off the wall and don \' t fit the situations very well ."", ""overall , this game is really well planned and definitely a game that you college basketball fans should try . it has very advanced controls that you must try to understand and learn by heart . the game also addresses the issue that basketball games weren \' t as challenging or realistic as they should have been . it seems this year is just ea \' s turning point in video games , and i \' m giddy just thinking about what ea has in store for us in their next installment . go play the game , and remember : offense wins games , defense wins championships ."", ""\' whispering willows \' ( all ) comes to nintendo switch this . . .""]', '[""eminem on how dr . dre prevented him from going \' too far \' on \' kamikaze \'"", ""label head who signed mac miller at 18 : \' he was a true visionary . as true as artists come \'"", \'complex participates in various affiliate marketing programs , which means complex gets paid commissions on purchases made through our links to retailer sites . our editorial content is not influenced by any commissions we receive .\', \'© 2018 complex media , inc . all rights reserved .\']', '[""luigi \' s mansion 3 ( working title ) has been announced for nintendo switch . watch more trailers here ! https : / / www . youtube . com / watch ? v = vvb2widudda & list = plaq . . . -

professed youngling bramwell pointed out last year . needless to say , tackling the \\\' original trilogy \\\' of episodes iv , v and vi and lego at the same time is about as potent a mixture as nostalgia gets for a thirty -

except you can wander over to a character customisation section and build yourself some crazed mutated abomination using the heads and bodies of familiar names , and settle on your weapon of choice . with that out of the way , you can kick off a new hope and work your way chronologically through six chapters per \' episode \' , or clear the first chapter and move onto the other episodes as you see fit ."", ""just like the original , the gameplay \' s the same moreish concoction of combat , puzzling , occasional platforming as well as some flight combat sorties to break things up . you can pretty much guarantee that most levels start off with a quick battle against some stormtroopers and various imperial guards , and then require a bitof puzzling in order to open a specific door , or negotiate your party across inaccessible areas before you \' re forced to get the blaster or lightsaber out again ."", ""as such , the combat \' s easily the most disappointing element of the lego star wars games , and the sequel hasn \' t really addressed this in any meaningful sense . using an over simplified auto aim system , the blaster or bowcaster takes care of almost every enemy in the entire game with one or two shots to the extent that it even takes care of distant targets on overhead gantries . it \' s certainly a helpful means of making sure kids will enjoy great success , but the drawback is that it makes the lightsaber feel hopelessly clunky and ineffective by comparison . in close combat situations , the jedi characters can literally squeeze the life out of anyone with their force choke move , but it takes far longer to see off a gaggle of enemies all heading for you if you try and swish the lightsaber in their direction than if you simply switch to someone who \' s handy with a blaster . the melee moves never feel quite right , but any limitations of the design are completely offset by the amount of mindless fun you have in simply smashing up one after the other . each character has its own specific melee move as well , so it \' s initially a lot of fun to see leia slapping enemies indignantly , or chewy ripping their arms off ."", ""han solo \' s expression gets us every time ."", ""where the gameplay really comes into its own is in its approach to puzzles . at first it might involve little more than rebuilding a pile of loose lego pieces into , say , a ramp for r2 - d2 or the hapless c - 3po to get up , but as the game progresses it becomes an ever more complex , and genuinely hilarious process . in scenes that would make the a - team \' s creations seem credible , a random pile of bricks gets transformed ( with an excellent flurried animation ) into a little truck for someone to ride around in ( for no apparent reason ) , or , more hilariously , a radio or little disco for the natives to rock out to . later , elaborate , multi - part constructions help you destroy obstacles and rebuild switches , passkey doors , grapple points and anything that the level designers could think of . you can sense they had a lot of fun while making the game , and this knowing nod to the absurdity of what you \' re doing makes it a real pleasure to chip your way through - if only to see what they can come up with next ."", ""as simple as the game seems to begin with ( a new hope being especially easy ) , by the time you \' ve reached return of the jedi , some of the puzzles are a real test of your resolve . although the solution is never far away , many times we were stumped because of the simple failure to destroy a seemingly innocuous item first . our advice : shoot everything . at the very least you \' ll earn a stack of bolts for it , which you \' ll quickly realise is vitally important to unlocking the dozens of characters and extras in the game ."", ""once again , all of the game \' s 18 main chapters are designed very much as a co - operative experience regardless of whether you \' re playing it alone or in two - player mode with a pal . at all times you \' re accompanied by at least one other appropriate cast member ( and sometimes five or more trail around after you ) , and this not only allows a friend to drop in on the action at any time in the game , but mean that you can quickly walk up to any one of the other characters and take control of them . not only does this help in combat situations ( with certain characters lacking weapons of any description ) , but means you can bypass certain security devices , or take advantage of certain special moves , like r2 - d2 \' s ability to hover across otherwise unreachable gaps , or luke skywalker \' s useful double - jump ability . force powers , in particular , become essential puzzle - solving abilities , with the jedi \' s able to haul heavy items ( that glow blue to let you know you can move them ) to enable you to piece together specific items or destroy obstacles ."", ""don \' t mess with leia , darth , she might slap ."", ""with no shortage of famous vehicular sequences to draw upon , we get to indulge in a number of superb , fast -

visit any level you have already completed with any of the characters you have unlocked during your previous progress .', 'this opens up a whole new world of replayability as each level has designated areas that are only accessible by certain characters such as bounty hunter missions , stormtrooper encrypted areas , and of course places that only a jedi can reach . there are also a ton of hidden items and things to collect that will require more than one play through of each level just to find everything . you can also unlock the ability to swap character pieces with one another creating some unlikely concoctions such as darth vader wearing princess leia’s slave outfit and so much more . it is like having a virtual set of star wars legos directly at your fingertips .', 'while the main game can easily be finished within 3 - 4 hours the extras can keep you playing for well over twenty hours , not to mention the co - op . speaking of multi - player this is one of my biggest complaints about lego star wars ii . while you can easily drop in and out of two - player mode at any given time there is absolutely no online play . this is a huge blow as this game could certainly benefit from it . sure playing on one console is fine and dandy , but the option to take it online via xbox live or any other online service would have made the already sweet package even better . this is even more stressed with the fact that playing solo can sometimes frustrate you because of the dumb - as - rocks ai in the game . i literally have watched my ai partner block every single attack the enemy throws without ever even attempting to take them out of the equation . thankfully they do serve a purpose as every level has certain characters that you have to take on your journey to progress through the level , but online play would have made this much less of a chore seeing as how you could play with a real person anytime you desired .', 'sometimes it is not wise to let the wookie win .', 'this time around traveller’s tales has also placed a greater emphasis on vehicles with many fan favorites such as the landspeeder and dewback making appearances . there are even levels designed solely around using these new modes of transportation including the death star run and the speeder bike chase on endor . and yes as always there is a hoth level complete with snowspeeder toe cables and at - ats to take out , who didn’t see that one coming ?', 'the visuals in lego star wars ii are definitely not going to set your hdtv on fire , but for what it is the game does a great job of conveying the atmosphere . being released on just fewer than ten consoles and every single one of them being almost identical is a sign that visuals were certainly not the priority of this endeavor . character animation has been beefed up and the xbox 360 version sports some gorgeous reflections and of course that 720p shine , but in general every version looks almost identical including the psp outing , minus of course the atrocious load times . all your favorite tunes from composer john williams are present and the sound effects are directly lifted from the lucas archives , but as i mentioned earlier you will not hear one word of spoken dialogue unless the subtle howling of a wookie counts .', 'while this recycles most of what made the original so much fun it still deserves credit for adding onto an already solid formula . if you enjoyed the first game and aren’t expecting a revolution in gaming you will find more than enough to keep you busy with this extremely solid sequel . fans of star wars in general need to play this game and anyone looking for a break from all the shooters , racers , and rpgs flooding the market today owe it to themselves to check out this simple , yet highly addictive little action title .', 'ken is the editor - in - chief of this hole in the wall and he loves to troll for the fun of it . he also enjoys long walks through arkham asylum and the cool air of shadow moses island . his turn - ons include mortal kombat , metal gear solid and starcraft .', 'please enter your username or email address . you will receive a link to create a new password via email .']"", '[\'doctype html public "" -

sacks . during a routine visit to my brotherâ€™s house , my eldest nephew was happily caning the game in the living room . after ten minutes of watching him hack , slash and blast his way through a horde of robots , he eventually decided to nip to the toilet , his ps2â€™s dual shock sat tempting me to have a go . checking the coast was clear , slightly embarrassed by the prospect of picking up a kidâ€™s game , i swallowed my pride and started a level . what happened next was something that hadnâ€™t happened for a while during a gaming session ; i smiled and laughed to myself , captivated ironically in a similar fashion as to when i saw the original star wars trilogy as a child myself all those years ago . the game was fun , with great simple play and had a very dry and sophisticated humour ; i was sold , and bought it that same week . now finally , developers travellers tales have given us\', \'a long , long time agoâ€¦ the story of the original and far superior star wars trilogy is something that everyone should know and experience at some point in their lives . if you havenâ€™t then i seriously suggest that you get yourself to you local dvd rental store as soon as humanly possible . for those who have been living under a rock for their entire lives , the story goes something like this : a young farm boy by the name of luke skywalker embarks on a fantastical journey with the help of his jedi mentor , obi wan kenobi , on a bid to take down the evil empire who are at rule over the universe . as the name suggests , lego star wars 2 : the original trilogy covers all of the original star wars films , and each is wonderfully interpreted in its lego incarnation . as with the previous game , travellers tales have managed take the key moments from all three films and have reinvigorated them adding a deft touch of humour to proceedings , making each one that little bit more memorable . the developers have perfectly nailed the humour , and it’s certainly not something thatâ€™s simply there to help make it even more accessible to children , there are times in the story that i genuinely laughed out loud , and include moments that will stay with me forever , thereâ€™s certainly no cheap laughs involved here .\', \'use the controller lukeâ€¦ lego star wars 2â€™s core gameplay has changed very little from the previous title , however this isnâ€™t a bad thing at all . playing out as a basic platformer , but also successfully fusing hack â€˜nâ€™ slash , shooter , and puzzle elements , there is never a dull moment due to the amount of variety that is on offer . just to add a little more to that variety , we have more flying sections than the previous game , which really arenâ€™t that dissimilar to the old top down shooters of yesteryear . the controls themselves are very simple to get to grips with , but do have enough depth to stop the game becoming brain numbingly boring . when you venture out into any level for the first time , you are forced to follow the set storyline structure . once any level is complete you are then able to go through again in freeplay mode as often as you like to get the rest of the collectables . in this mode you choose from any two of the unlocked characters , and are given a further set including all the unit classes that are required to complete the core objectives .\', \'iâ€™ve mentioned the word â€˜collectables’ above ; make a note of that , as it is a key word as far as lego star wars is concerned . hoarding is something youâ€™ll be busying yourself with if you want to 100 % this game , whether it be collecting as many coins as possible to break the â€˜true jediâ€™ rating in each level , and to purchase more characters and extras from the cantina base level , or itâ€™s gold bricks to open up yet more levels and modes . making their return from the previous game are the legendary hidden mini - kits , which are littered around all the levels . once again as previously , the more kits that are unlocked from each level , the more they build up an instantly recognizable star wars vehicle outside the cantina . once some of the models are completed , certain ones become unlocked for use in particular levels . with all this to keep you coming back to each level , coupled with plenty of achievements to win , it becomes apparent that this game isnâ€™t the easy romp you may have thought early on .\', \'sound and light ( sabers ) â€¦ the weakest area of lego star wars 2 comes in its very slight visual superiority over other versions . aside from adding high - definition to the equation , plus a tiny bit of polish , it would appear that there was very little work put in to make a huge graphical step - up from the last - gen versions . otherwise , the games design is perfect , presenting an odd balance where the game does feel like an authentic lego game , but also like fully - fledged star wars title . as usual with star wars games , the sound effects are absolutely spot - on ; with every gun blast , with every saber swipe , and with every vehicle screech , you find yourself sporting an enormous nostalgic joker - esque grin spanning from ear - to - ear . the characters themselves donâ€™t use full speech ; instead utilize mumbling sound - a - like sound bites . this approach serves a thoughtful purpose , offering the developers a far greater variety in the way of visual humour . it’s this area where the game comes into its own .\', \'the force is strong with this oneâ€¦ the million - dollar question that faces those pondering the purchase of lego star wars 2 : the original trilogy is : â€˜is it worth the extra twenty pounds over the last - gen version ? â€™ this is a question that is made even harder to answer when you consider that the original xbox version is actually listed as a backwards - compatible title , it just seems like a particularly odd move . whichever way you feel about the possible answer to that question , if you buy either version you are still in for a treat as it is worth every penny . admittedly if you are solely concentrating on the story mode , then you may not be kept occupied for an age , but if you want to complete the game properly you will have to be prepared to put the hours in , because it does take skill . combining timeless events , great humour , simple yet effective gameplay , and just an astonishing amount of variety all in one little package , itâ€™s hard not to find something about this game that makes you smile . an absolute must for all star wars fans , kids and just big kids alike .\', \'05 -

when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away . however , they instantly respawn and can often re - collect the lost studs . the game ' s central location is the mos eisley cantina , a spaceport bar on the planet tatooine . at the counter , the player may use their lego studs to purchase characters , vehicles , gameplay hints and extras , or activate cheat codes . in a small area outside the cantina , players may view collected vehicles . the game is broken into levels , which are accessed from the cantina ; each film is represented by six levels , representing key locations and scenes in that film . the locations include hoth , bespin , dagobah , tatooine , the death star , and endor . the game also features bonus levels . during levels , the player defeats enemies , builds objects out of lego bricks and drives vehicles , certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles , including a tie fighter , a snowspeeder , and the millennium falcon . levels must first be played in story mode . this unlocks the next level as well as a free play mode for the recently completed level . gameplay is identical in the two modes . however , story mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on , while free play offers all those unlocked . levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items . three types of secret items are available : gold bricks , minikits , and power bricks . within each level is hidden one power brick . when a power brick is collected , its corresponding extra , such as invincibility or stud multipliers , becomes available for purchase . each level also contains ten hidden minikits , that is , ten pieces of a star wars vehicle . when all ten have been collected , the player is awarded a gold brick . collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards , such as a spigot that spews out studs . gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed , and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level ; ninety - nine gold bricks are available . the vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina . as each vehicle is completed ( all ten minikits collected ) , it becomes available for play in a bonus level .



 == playable characters == 



over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game , including variations of luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , chewbacca , lando calrissian , r2 - d2 , c - 3po , darth vader , wicket the ewok , and boba fett . character abilities have a greater role in lego star wars ii than in lego star wars . certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas . characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles , double jump and use the force . r2 - d2 , c - 3po , and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors . small characters like the ewok and jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas . bounty hunters , such as boba fett , may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects . sith , like darth vader , can use the force to manipulate black lego objects . some characters have unique abilities ; for example , chewbacca can rip enemies ' arms from their sockets , darth vader can choke enemies with the force , princess leia possesses a slap attack , and lando calrissian can use a kung - fu - like attack . special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets , and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities . this means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode . the player can unlock the "" use old save "" extra , which imports all unlocked characters from lego star wars for use in free play ; however , a lego star wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains lego star wars ii ' s save data . players can create two customized characters in the mos eisley cantina . these characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters ; 2 , 258 , 163 , 204 combinations are possible . entering two cheat codes , publicized by ign , makes pieces for a santa claus character available . the game generates names for the characters based on the pieces used ( for example , a character made from pieces of darth vader and c - 3po might have the name "" darth - 3po "" ) ; alternately , the player may create a name .",lego star wars ii : the original trilogy,"['doctype html\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nSkip to sections navigation\n\n\n\nSkip to content\n\n\n\nSkip to footer\n\n\n\nOur network\n\n\n\nSubscribe Log In\n\n\n\nOpen\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nSubscribe -\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nclose\n\n\n\nSearch Site\n\n\n\nSections\n\n\n\nNetwork\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nSydney\n\n\n\nNSW\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nFederal\n\n\n\nNSW\n\n\n\nVictoria\n\n\n\nQueensland\n\n\n\nACT\n\n\n\nWestern Australia\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nThe economy\n\n\n\nMarkets\n\n\n\nCompanies\n\n\n\nBanking & finance\n\n\n\nSmall business\n\n\n\nConsumer affairs\n\n\n\nWorkplace\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nNorth America\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n\nAsia\n\n\n\nMiddle East\n\n\n\nOceania\n\n\n\nCentral America\n\n\n\nSouth America\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\n\nNational\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nVictoria\n\n\n\nQueensland\n\n\n\nACT\n\n\n\nWestern Australia\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nNRL\n\n\n\nRugby Union\n\n\n\nAFL\n\n\n\nSoccer\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nRacing\n\n\n\nMotorsport\n\n\n\nNetball\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nBasketball\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nNFL\n\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\n\nSwimming\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nSailing\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nMovies\n\n\n\nTV & Radio\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nCelebrity\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nComedy\n\n\n\nDance\n\n\n\nMusicals\n\n\n\nOpera\n\n\n\nTheatre\n\n\n\nArt & design\n\n\n\nTV guide\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nLife & relationships\n\n\n\nHealth & wellness\n\n\n\nFashion\n\n\n\nBeauty\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nSuper & retirement\n\n\n\nInvesting\n\n\n\nBanking\n\n\n\nBorrowing\n\n\n\nSaving\n\n\n\nTax\n\n\n\nPlanning & budgeting\n\n\n\nInsurance\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nShow subsections\n\n\n\nConservation\n\n\n\nClimate Change\n\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\n\nWeather\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nFood & wine\n\n\n\nExecutive style\n\n\n\nToday\'s Paper\n\n\n\nFor subscribers\n\n\n\nLetters\n\n\n\nEditorial\n\n\n\nColumn 8\n\n\n\nObituaries\n\n\n\nGood Weekend\n\n\n\nQuizzes\n\n\n\nWeather\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nThe Age\n\n\n\nBrisbane Times\n\n\n\nWAtoday\n\n\n\nThe Canberra Times\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Review\n\n\n\nDomain\n\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\n\n\nAllhomes\n\n\n\nDrive\n\n\n\nGood Food\n\n\n\nTraveller\n\n\n\nExecutive Style\n\n\n\nOver Sixty\n\n\n\nEssential Baby\n\n\n\nEssential Kids\n\n\n\nFind A Babysitter\n\n\n\nThe Store\n\n\n\nWeatherzone\n\n\n\nRSVP\n\n\n\nAdzuna\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nGames\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II\n\n\n\nBy Jason Hill\n\n\n\n16 September 2006 — 10:00am\n\n\n\nNormal text size Larger text size Very large text size\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II PS2, PSP, PC, Xbox and 360, GameCube From $49.95 PG Rating: 5/5\n\n\n\nThis is one of the most entertaining games of the year, an epic Lego adventure where you will be called upon to swing lightsabres, fire blasters, pilot ships and use the Force to stop Darth Vader building his evil empire.\n\n\n\nBased on the beloved original film trilogy, Lego Star Wars II is a significant improvement on its delightful predecessor, which sold more than four million copies.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFew will be able to resist the game\'s incredible charm. The dinky characters are packed with charisma and the retelling of the story over 18 levels along with the hilarious film clips is both a loving tribute and a side-splitting parody.\n\n\n\nThanks to simple controls and the inspired decision to not penalise mistakes harshly, anyone can pick up a joypad and instantly have fun. But in response to the original\'s popularity among ""hardcore"" gamers, levels are now significantly larger and the puzzles more complex, which might mean youngsters need an occasional helping hand.\n\n\n\nFortunately, this is a perfect game for parents to enjoy with their kids. It fosters teamwork, lets players jump in and out of the action and it does not matter if one player is more skilled than another.\n\n\n\nOther improvements include a lot more secrets to reveal, more Lego building elements, new (and amusing) melee attacks, the chance to dodge incoming fire, animals to ride and vehicles to pilot, such as X-wings, Snowspeeders and the Millennium Falcon. Vehicle-based stages are now more in keeping with the on-foot action and plenty of ships are available, ensuring young players don\'t get frustrated.\n\n\n\nThe number of secrets to unlock makes the prospect of replaying levels even more appealing, especially with such a large cast. There\'s also a new character-combination feature that lets you mix parts from different characters to make new heroes, such as Han Vader.\n\n\n\nEndgame: A wonderful game that rewards experimentation and co-operation. Great fun for all ages.\n\n\n\nLicense this article\n\n\n\nGames\n\n\n\nMost Viewed in Technology\n\n\n\nLoading\n\n\n\nA relationship banned under traditional law.\n\n\n\nOur new podcast series from the team behind Phoebe\'s Fall\n\n\n\nView episodes\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nOur Sites\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nThe Age\n\n\n\nBrisbane Times\n\n\n\nThe Canberra Times\n\n\n\nWAtoday\n\n\n\nThe Australian Financial Review\n\n\n\nDomain\n\n\n\nTraveller\n\n\n\nGood Food\n\n\n\nExecutive Style\n\n\n\nThe Store by Fairfax\n\n\n\nDrive\n\n\n\nAdzuna\n\n\n\nRSVP\n\n\n\nEssential Baby\n\n\n\nEssential Kids\n\n\n\nWeatherzone\n\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\n\nTributes\n\n\n\nCelebrations\n\n\n\nPlace your ad\n\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate\n\n\n\nOneflare\n\n\n\nNabo\n\n\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald\n\n\n\nContact & support\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\n\nAccessibility guide\n\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\nProducts & Services\n\n\n\nSubscription packages\n\n\n\nSubscriber benefits\n\n\n\nMy account\n\n\n\nSubscriptions FAQs\n\n\n\nToday\'s Paper\n\n\n\nFairfax Media\n\n\n\nPhoto sales\n\n\n\nPurchase front pages\n\n\n\nFairfax syndication\n\n\n\nFairfax events\n\n\n\nFairfax careers\n\n\n\nConditions of use\n\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\nPress Council\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2018\n\n\n\nFairfax Media\n\n\n\nFeedback Subscribe', ""html\n\n\n\nHome Page – The TLS\n\n\n\nThe times Literary supplement\n\n\n\nThe leading international weekly for literary culture\n\n\n\nLogout\n\n\n\nSubscribe Login\n\n\n\nLatest Edition\n\n\n\nSubjects\n\n\n\nMary Beard\n\n\n\nDaily\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nSearch:\n\n\n\nSearch by author, title, reviewer or keyword\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nThis week's TLS\n\n\n\nSeptember 14, 2018\n\n\n\nAlcohol and art; David Foster Wallace’s worst friend; the purpose of biography; asking a philosopher for advice; stories of Bruce Lee; how China became a twenty-first-century nation; gentleman publishers – and much more\n\n\n\nView edition\n\n\n\nIn next week's TLS\n\n\n\nOUT\n\n\n\n21 Sep 2018\n\n\n\nPHILIP HORNE\n\n\n\nHenry James in LA\n\n\n\nSUSAN IRVINE\n\n\n\nHow to read an Anglo-Saxon poem\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\n\n\nHow to advertise\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nClassifieds\n\n\n\nCopyright © The Times Literary Supplement Limited 2018.

Now, I\'m guessing that if you\n\n\n\ndid\n\n\n\npass on playing the first game that it was because you thought it was ""a dumb kid\'s game"" or because ""the game\'s based on the\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nprequels, and those suck."" Well, that second excuse won\'t fly anymore because this sequel is based on the original trilogy. You know, the one that everyone likes.\n\n\n\nAs for that first excuse, the\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars\n\n\n\ngames are more family games than pure kid\'s games (and they\'re hardly ""dumb""). Sure, they\'re simple enough for a kid to pick up and enjoy, and a skilled player can plow through the main story mode in a few hours, but there\'s a lot more depth below the surface.\n\n\n\nFor the benefit of those who may not have noticed the\n\n\n\nmultiple recent previews of the game\n\n\n\n, here\'s what\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II\n\n\n\nis all about. It\'s based on the popular line of LEGO sets that are based on the popular movies. The game\'s Story Mode is split up into three parts, each one focusing on one of the original\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nfilms. Within each of these film-based sections, there are six stages.\n\n\n\nThe first time you play through each stage, the characters that you can control are dependent on the movie\'s storyline. When on the swamp world of Dagobah, for instance, you can only play as Luke, R2-D2, and Yoda since they were the only characters on that planet in\n\n\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\n\n\n. After completing each stage, you typically unlock new playable characters, including most of the enemies that you face in the game. Completed stages can then be revisited in Free Mode, which allows you to select whatever character you want to play as, and a party of other characters is automatically chosen to accompany you in the level.\n\n\n\nThey\'re Full of Surprises\n\n\n\nHaving a wide variety of characters in Free Mode is important since there are lots of secrets to discover and many characters have unique skills. Jedi characters like Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi use their lightsabers to deflect incoming laser fire, and the Force allows them to manipulate certain LEGO elements within each stage. Some LEGO bricks can only be controlled by evil Sith lords. Here\'s where Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine come into play. ""Blaster"" characters are those armed with laser guns, including Han Solo and Princess Leia. They can not only attack enemies from afar with their lasers, but they\'re also armed with grappling hooks that allow them to reach high places. Locked doors need droids to open, so keep R2-D2 and C-3PO around. R2 can even use his leg-mounted rockets (which is only used in the prequel trilogy) to cross large pits. Bounty hunters like Boba Fett can toss explosive thermal detonators that are required to destroy certain objects and obstacles. Making proper use of each of the characters\' abilities is necessary in order to track down all the hidden goodies in each level.\n\n\n\nYour exploration efforts will be rewarded with new gameplay modes, all of which have you competing against the clock (and another player, if you choose). The Character Bonus places you within a maze-like arena inspired by different levels and times you on how quickly you can collect a million LEGO studs (this may sound like a daunting task, but it can typically be done in less than five minutes). If you\'ve played the original\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars\n\n\n\n, you will remember collecting Minikit Canisters which were used to build model vehicles. In that game, the vehicles could just be admired, but now, they have a purpose. Any vehicle that you construct can be used in the Minikit Bonus levels. They play just like the Character Bonus stages, except you can pilot several different ships.

Yes, the game lampoons the classic cinematic series but in the process it creates an alternate but independent Star Wars universe based on LEGO models which are based on the original Star Wars characters. This game has single handedly broken two cultural barriers: Star Wars isn’t just for nerds, and LEGO isn’t just for kids.\n\n\n\nAmazingly LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy follows the events of the first three Star Wars movies – in other words, the good ones. Liberties are taken with the plot but that’s all part of the fun. The Story mode does a great job of keeping characters and events in chronological order. All of your favorite Star Wars characters are featured in this game including Luke, Obi, Hans, the Princess, Chewy, R2, C3PO and Darth Vader. If you played the first LEGO Star Wars game you’ll be able to import your favorite characters from that game into this one. Each character has unique powers which will come in handy for different situations. While the gameplay is rather simple, there are tons of unlockables to find which creates its own kind of challenge. You will have to scour the levels from top to bottom to find these goodies which include everything from new characters to new modes. The only way that you can access all of the areas in each level is to exploit the different characters’ abilities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nThe Shame of Your Gaming Backlog\n\n\n\nThe Endless Tragedy of Digital Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nIs The Division Afraid to Get Political?\n\n\n\nIs Gaming Addiction a Thing (And Why We Can’t Decide)\n\n\n\nWhy You Might Be a Game Glitch Snob\n\n\n\nHow Gaming Ruins Relationships (And Why It Should Stop)\n\n\n\nWhy Video Game Secrets Matter\n\n\n\nCan Non-Fans Enjoy Sports Games?\n\n\n\nLet\'s Trade Microtransactions for Unlockables\n\n\n\nThis Sequel Will Send You into a RAGE!\n\n\n\nWhere Should Nintendo’s Classics Go Next?\n\n\n\nHow Fortnite Became #1 (and PUBG Didn\'t)\n\n\n\nWhy Deadpool Is F%#king Awesomesauce\n\n\n\nWhy PUBG Is Screwing up Big Time\n\n\n\nHow Video Games Can Get You Arrested\n\n\n\nMore Special Features...\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nLuke and Obi have the Force on their side. With it they can move LEGO objects that would otherwise be immovable. They are also equipped with lightsabers which not only take care of enemies quite nicely but can also be used to foil laser traps which will get them into inaccessible areas. When it comes to ranged combat, Hans Solo and Princess Leia use laser blasters to take out the enemy from a relatively safe distance. They are also equipped with grappling hooks so that they can climb walls and get to higher regions. To get through locked doors you will need the skills of the droids. This is where R2 and C3PO earn their keep. They can hack into computer networks and retrieve access codes to open sealed doors. With his attached rockets, R2D2 has the added ability to propel himself across wide expanses. Being evil has its benefits as well. The dark Sith lord, Darth Vader also has the Force at his command and can also move various LEGO blocks and objects. In fact there are certain ones that can only be moved by those who have joined the dark side. All of these different powers will allow you to seek out hidden treasures located throughout each level. You may just want to tackle the Story mode first and come back for the collectibles later. Regardless of how you pace yourself there is always plenty of things to do in this game.\n\n\n\nAside from the main Story mode, there is a Free Mode which lets you play as any character in any level that you’ve previously unlocked. This is why it may be to your benefit to complete the Story mode first so that you can go back as any character to search for the unlockables. The Super Story mode is a race against time. You have one hour to get through one of the three movie episode levels. You won’t have any time to waste so you’ll just have to push through it. If you manage to accomplish this task you’ll be rewarded with gold bricks which you can use to unlock even more levels. In the bonus rounds you will be able to collect LEGO studs, a million of them to be exact. These studs are used like money. With them you can purchase weapons, power-ups and other goodies.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of interactivity in the game, between characters as well as the environments. Characters can literally be combined using the Character Customizer which will allow you to make your own Star Wars characters out of any of the existing characters’ body parts. How about ChewLeia or Darth3PO? A plethora of objects constructed out of LEGO blocks can be smashed and reassembled into other objects such as stairs or ramps to help you gain access to a hard-to-reach area. In this game, as opposed to the first one, the vehicles that you build such as the Tie Fighters and Star Destroyer can actually be used.\n\n\n\nAnother player can join in anytime and instantly access the Co-op mode. There is always another AI character with you and the player will assume the role of that particular character the instant he or she enters the game. That character can then be relegated back to the AI at anytime and the main player will not be affected at all by the change. This is a well thought-out system that will encourage multi-playing with even the most inexperienced of gamers. It’s unfortunate there isn’t an online mode but considering how much is offered in this title, one can’t really complain much.\n\n\n\nThe production values are good but they aren’t great. There are some camera issues but you do have more control over it than with the first game. There are some framerate hiccups but overall it’s relatively smooth going. The characters look amazing and the stages are filled with detail and depth totally befitting the LEGO/Star Wars universe – which is basically composed of shiny, plastic, material. There aren’t any voiceovers but I hope you weren’t expecting this to be voiced by the original cast. The score is obviously composed by John Williams and even though you’ve heard it before, there’s nothing else that could be more fitting, save perhaps the entire orchestration performed through a shiny, plastic, Casio keyboard.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, LEGO Star Wars II is action, adventure, collecting, puzzles, races, mini-game, Co-op mode and your favorite Star Wars characters all having a great time. All you need is a copy of this game to join in on the fun. Highly recommended for players of all ages.\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n\nRelive the Fun in a Whole New Way! The game that lets you combine the fun of LEGO with all the action and excitement of Star Wars now lets you battle through all your favorite moments in the Original Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI).\n\n\n\nFrom Luke and Princess Leia to Han Solo and Darth Vader, now play over 50 of your favorite characters in a humorous and unique LEGO setting.\n\n\n\nBuild and Customize with a Galaxy of New Features. For the first time ever, you can build and ride new vehicles and creatures and get in and out to explore the world of the Original Star Wars Trilogy. Create and customize new characters with new abilities. With even more destructible environments and more challenging puzzles, playing LEGO Star Wars has never been more fun.\n\n\n\nPlay with Your Buddies.

See Rating legend above for a final score breakdown.\n\n\n\nPreview\n\n\n\nIn the history of ""Ideas so crazy they just might work"", the LEGO Star Wars video games stand as the shining example. by Patrick Evans\n\n\n\nGrowing up, LEGOs are toys that spark children’s imagination. From the simple building blocks of a house to the multi-colored “planks” of a pirate ship or a square, boxy build of a race car, the only limitation to what you can build is the imagination. So when last year, LucasArts reached into our childhoods with their retelling of Episodes One through Three in LEGO Star Wars. Answering the calls of countless fans, myself included, LucasArts will now retell the original trilogy in LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy.\n\n\n\nStarring the cast of the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II will refine the formula set by its predecessor in providing fun adventure gameplay and combat while remaining fairly accessible to casual gamers. One of the most important adjustments to the “ease” in gameplay will be the adjustable difficulty. If, throughout a level perhaps, you are getting your rear handed to you by various storm troopers and the like, the game will adjust its difficulty down to allow players to continue making progress through the game instead of giving up in frustration. On the other hand, if you are slaughtering everything you come across without so much as a ding, which may have been the case for some players of the original, then the difficulty will ratchet upwards to keep play interesting.\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars allowed players to play as their favorite characters throughout the game and unlock countless goodies, but The Original Trilogy will go one better by allowing players to customize their character with interchangeable parts. That’s right, you can have the head of Princess Leia on the body of Han Solo carrying a light-saber while donning Darth Vader’s black cape. LucasArts will be rewarding owners of the original by using their save files to unlock the original unlockable characters. Including the original characters, over 100 characters will be accessible in The Original Trilogy, including Luke, Lando, Greedo, and every other memorable character imaginable.\n\n\n\nThe customization doesn’t end there either. Like in the original, players will construct different vehicles throughout the game to accomplish goals and clear levels. This time around, however, all non-droid characters will be able to construct vehicles from parts strewn across the stage. These pieces will be found behind obstacles and whatnot, requiring various character skills to access. Additionally, hidden model kit pieces will be hidden in each of the levels throughout the trilogy, allowing you to use custom vehicles, which aren’t found by default in game, through specific stages.\n\n\n\nCharacter specific combat and moves will be expanded upon, making the difference between playing as Han Solo and Chewbacca two completely different gameplay experiences. While Vader may be able to use a Force Choke-Hold to defeat opponents, Chewbacca will be adept at ripping the LEGO arms off of stormtroopers. As stated above, various characters will be able to solve specific puzzles as well. Chewbacca’s brute strength would be useless in a specific stage, for instance, where Luke’s force abilities would be required.\n\n\n\nThese improvements and more, such as bigger level designs and a more competent camera system, will ensure that fans of the original will be more than satisfied by the LEGO telling of Episodes four through six. Look for the LEGO pieces to start flying late this summer.\n\n\n\nBy Patrick Evans\n\n\n\nCCC Staff Writer\n\n\n\nAround The Web\n\n\n\nMore Cheats & Codes\n\n\n\nAround The Web\n\n\n\nScreenshots / Images\n\n\n\nSlideshow\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS PAGE\n\n\n\n<![endif]–>\n\n\n\nAROUND THE WEB\n\n\n\nBest New Stuff on CheatCC\n\n\n\nCheatCC\'s Exclusive Assassin\'s Creed: Odyssey Interview\n\n\n\nLogitech 4K Pro Webcam Will Make You Look Good\n\n\n\nCan Rating Warnings Go Too Far?\n\n\n\nAre Companies Doing Enough to Keep Gamers Safe?\n\n\n\nTop 5 Women Who Shaped Nerd Culture\n\n\n\nWhy Does Fighting Game DLC Get Such a Bad Rap?\n\n\n\nShould Games Keep It Short N\' Sweet?\n\n\n\nIs Sharing Always Caring in Video Games?\n\n\n\nAre Some Fans Already Rejecting Cyberpunk 2077?\n\n\n\n7 Comic Characters That Deserve Games\n\n\n\nWhy Japan Needs More Adults-Only Games\n\n\n\nDo Games Have the Power to Change North Korea?\n\n\n\nIs Microsoft Forcing the Industry Forward?\n\n\n\nWhy We Still Love Metroidvanias\n\n\n\n10 Super Weird Appearances of Super Mario\n\n\n\nMore Special Features...\n\n\n\nTHE WEEKLY POLL\n\n\n\nWhich game is master of the Battle Royale genre?\n\n\n\nPUBG\n\n\n\nFortnite\n\n\n\nH1Z1\n\n\n\nFuture release (like Black Ops 4)\n\n\n\nView Poll History\n\n\n\nAlso Worth Reading!\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nWhy VR Will Never Overtake Traditional Gaming\n\n\n\nAre Fortnite Coaches a Big Deal?\n\n\n\nIs the Game of the Year Discussion Already Over?\n\n\n\nWill Halo Infinite Take Halo Back to the Top?\n\n\n\nThe Battle of the Kart Racers Is About to Begin\n\n\n\nIntellivision Returns to Us (At Just the Right Moment)\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n""Like"" CheatCC on Facebook\n\n\n\nFollow @cheatcc\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nSwitch\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nVita\n\n\n\nWii\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n\nPS2\n\n\n\nOther Systems\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nGameCube\n\n\n\nPSOne\n\n\n\nN64\n\n\n\nGBA\n\n\n\nGame Boy\n\n\n\nDreamcast\n\n\n\nDVD\n\n\n\nVideos | Podcasts | Special Features | Game News | Advertise With Us | Contact Us\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\nSteam Now Selling Uncensored Adult Games PUBG Drops to Under One Million Players Nintendo Announces Nintendo Switch Pokemon Bundles Breaking Down the Best of Sony’s Pre-TGS Announcements Get a Look at COD: Black Ops 4 Blackout\'s Map and Gameplay Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition Jumps to Consoles More News...\n\n\n\nCopyright © 1997-2018 Cheat Code Central.

Dick Vitale, the voice of college hoops, takes you through the sport\'s strategy and drama all the way to the ""Big Dance"" like no one else can. The unique, fast-paced game comes to life with players applying pressure D, diving on loose balls, and throwing it down against rival schools.\n\n\n\nGenre : Sports Publisher: EA Developer: EA Sports Release Date: November 17, 2003\n\n\n\nBuy \'NCAA MARCH MADNESS 2004\': Xbox | PlayStation 2\n\n\n\nIn college, there are several things that students do: drink, study like there\'s no tomorrow, and show their enormous college pride. The massive cheering and stomping that occurs at home team sports events can be compared to a monstrous earthquake. When an incredible athletic feat transpires, the Richter scale may be unable to measure the caliber of the ensuing commotion. Yes, all of this excitement can be found at a local college basketball game.\n\n\n\nNCAA March Madness is a college basketball game with over 320 schools from which to choose. It\'s the third game of the EA franchise on the PS2, and the game play has improved in several key areas, but with this installment, does EA maintain its reputation for being the #1 selling college basketball franchise?\n\n\n\nIf you have played the older NCAA basketball games, you will notice that this title\'s game play has been completely revamped. I have personally played last year\'s NCAA, and I noticed a major problem: it was way too easy to take the rock to the hole, making the game feel totally unrealistic. For example, you never had to wait for an opening to pass the ball, and regardless of the accuracy of the pass, your teammate would still get it. This, my friends, is the area that was revamped. Not only is it harder to score, but you can\'t just randomly throw up a pass and hope that it will reach your teammate. Lurking hands will be swinging around in the air, hoping to deflect the pass and lead to a fast break, perhaps the second most embarrassing way to get scored on (the first is breaking the opponents\' ankles by beating them to the hole). While the developers have completely changed the easiest sports games into the most advanced and incredibly complicated games to pick up, the plus side is that the games have a lot more replay value.\n\n\n\nThe available modes for the game are: Season, Dynasty, Mascot, Rivalry, Tournament, Practice, and lastly, Online. The main mode of play is either Season or Dynasty. In Season mode, you play only one season of games, while in Dynasty, you play through 10 years. I would personally choose Dynasty because you have more options and control over your team. You get to set your schedule, train, cut players, recruit before the season starts, and even partake in a session of roundball classic, where you play with the best 20 high school seniors for fun and possibly even recruit them. There is also a ""Play now"" option, which lets you dive right into a game without any fuss or planning.\n\n\n\nThe developers have implemented something similar to Madden\'s Progression to this game as well. In Madden, the player progresses in two fields during the year in regular season and training in the off-season. In NCAA, I have only noticed improvements when you train the team in the off-season. Training for NCAA is very different from Madden\'s training. If you played Madden 2004, you will know that in order to train your team in the off-season, you have to train them yourself. In NCAA, you preset your team\'s training conditions, and it is completely automated, although I really wish that you could take the player into practice yourself. Another thing I would have loved to see is the team practicing when it does not have any games for which to prepare. In real life, these college players\' lives revolve around basketball, and they are constantly practicing to improve and ensure victory over school rivals.\n\n\n\nTo cope with the school rivalries, the developers have implemented two separate modes: mascot and rival matches. The mascot matches are probably one of the most interesting to watch, but that\'s not necessarily a good thing. It looks like dolls are out on the basketball court trying to bust out their moves against one another. How would you react to seeing Stanford\'s entire team dressed up as trees, facing off against Syracuse\'s team, dressed up as orange M&Ms (Orangemen)? You just can\'t help but think that it looks so wrong. If you are with me on this, you should head over to the rivalry matches, where EA has set up a decent amount of rivalry-filled matchups, like UCLA vs. USC, Stanford vs. Cal, and many more. The only setback is that some schools are complicated and don\'t have just one rival, and these other matches were not implemented. While it would have been nice, all the possible rivalries among so many schools would have been quite the hassle.\n\n\n\nI attend UC Santa Barbara so naturally, my first task at hand was to find my team. Imagine my surprise when I found UC Santa Bill instead, but apparently, the NCAA doesn\'t have permission to use some school names and mascots, and my school was among this bunch. Because of this, some schools won\'t have mascots, correct names, and sometimes, aren\'t even placed in the correct league. I guess licensing issues are always a pain to deal with, and I truly hope that they get more into their next installment.\n\n\n\nThe in-game play is truly impressive. The game is not the easiest one to pick up, and you will need to learn and understand the key configurations and memorize them. Unlike the older NCAA games, schooling or breaking the opponent\'s ankle is quite hard (juke, faking out, getting beat). To control the ball, EA has implemented the Freestyle controls, and something this good is not developed overnight so I wonder how long this idea has been hiding up their sleeves. Freestyle is done by using the right analog stick, and it feels like the ball is really in your hand. Move the right analog stick from left to right to dribble from your left hand to the right hand for a cross over, hit forward to spin, and lastly, you can do a delay on holding the ball on a certain hand. Other moves that are important to offense are the low post moves, which let you back down as well as pull off the fade away jump shots.\n\n\n\nOffense isn\'t the only place that the Freestyle is in use; EA has also implemented this on the defensive side. You can use the Freestyle to steal, defensive crouch, hands up, and lastly, off-ball switch. This makes stealing the ball a lot easier, and you don\'t need to use many of the other keys, unless you prefer them. Another important thing to learn is to change defense formations by hitting the four directions on the digital pad. Formations usually range from double team all the way to full court press.\n\n\n\nThe basketball courts are pretty detailed, and I don\'t know if the courts were modeled after their real-life counterparts, but the Syracuse court is simply stunning. As for the teams for which the NCAA doesn\'t have licensing rights, I couldn\'t find any noticeable differences to set one court apart from another. The best way to see the stadium is to go through the four different views: baseline low, press box, baseline high, and sideline. The one I personally prefer is the default view, baseline low, because it gives you the perspective necessary to win games. The graphics of the characters are nice but far from awing. Since I don\'t follow the NCAA that closely, I can\'t really say that the character faces match the players, but overall, the graphics are nice.\n\n\n\nThe music in the game isn\'t all that great but extremely well thought-out. As we college students know, wherever there is a game, there is a band. Rather than having any of the upbeat music you hear in their other franchise titles, the developers used band music, which is very fitting for the game. Another sound that fits the game quite well is the cheering from the crowd. We know how hectic the home games are, and boy did they implement that well. The only sound portion that I am really annoyed with is the voice of an overly enthusiastic announcer; his comments are off the wall and don\'t fit the situations very well.\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is really well planned and definitely a game that you college basketball fans should try. It has very advanced controls that you must try to understand and learn by heart. The game also addresses the issue that basketball games weren\'t as challenging or realistic as they should have been. It seems this year is just EA\'s turning point in video games, and I\'m giddy just thinking about what EA has in store for us in their next installment. Go play the game, and remember: offense wins games, defense wins championships.\n\n\n\nScore: 9.0/10\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\n\n\n\ncomments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\nblog comments powered by\n\n\n\nDisqus\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nReviewers\n\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\n\n\n\'Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey\' (ALL) Goes Gold\n\n\n\nFormer Riot Games Vets Start New Game Studio, Singularity 6\n\n\n\n\'Space Junkies\' Closed Beta Date Set - Screens & Trailer\n\n\n\n\'Assault Spy\' Gets Release Date\n\n\n\n\'Whispering Willows\' (ALL) Comes to Nintendo Switch This...\n\n\n\nEverything else\n\n\n\nJoin Us!\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n©2000-2018 Worthplaying', 'html\n\n\n\nVideo Games | Complex\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nStyle\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nSneakers\n\n\n\nShows\n\n\n\nMaking Culture Pop.\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\nGet Your Weekly Digest\n\n\n\nENTER\n\n\n\nChannels\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nStyle\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nSneakers\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nComplex UK\n\n\n\nComplex Australia\n\n\n\nComplex Canada\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\nShows\n\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\nFuse TV\n\n\n\nMore from Complex Networks\n\n\n\nFirst We Feast\n\n\n\nPigeons & Planes\n\n\n\nSole Collector\n\n\n\nVideo Games\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nHere Are the Top 10 Players in \'FIFA 19\'\n\n\n\nBy Spencer Lund\n\n\n\nSep 12, 2018\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\n\'Marvel\'s Spider-Man\' Is \'Grand Theft Auto V\' For Superheroes\n\n\n\nBy Khal\n\n\n\nSep 7, 2018\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\n\'Madden 19\' Tournament Shooting Survivor Files Lawsuit Against EA\n\n\n\nBy Victoria Johnson\n\n\n\nAug 31, 2018\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nHere Are the Top-Rated Players in \'NBA 2K19\'\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Mansfield\n\n\n\nAug 30, 2018\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nTravis Scott Performs Surprise Set at NBA 2K19 Launch Party in New York\n\n\n\nBy Sarah Jasmine Montgomery\n\n\n\nAug 30, 2018\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\nEA Sports Cancels Its Remaining \'Madden 19\' Tournament Qualifier Events\n\n\n\nBy Sarah Jasmine Montgomery\n\n\n\nAug 28, 2018\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nPusha-T Sends Gamer Well Wishes as He Goes Into Surgery After Tragic Shooting\n\n\n\nBy Gavin Evans\n\n\n\nAug 27, 2018\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nMore Information Revealed About \'Madden 19\' Tournament Shooter and Victims\n\n\n\nBy Sarah Jasmine Montgomery\n\n\n\nAug 27, 2018\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nParkland Survivors Call Out Florida Politicians Following Jacksonville Shooting\n\n\n\nBy tara mahadevan\n\n\n\nAug 26, 2018\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nPolice Report Mass Shooting in Jacksonville During \'Madden 19\' Tournament (UPDATE)\n\n\n\nBy Victoria Johnson\n\n\n\nAug 26, 2018\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nWWE Superstar Notches Guinness World Record for Gaming Channel\n\n\n\nBy Victoria Johnson\n\n\n\nAug 25, 2018\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\nXbox to Reportedly Launch \'All Access\' Subscription Service That Will Include Console\n\n\n\nBy Jose Martinez\n\n\n\nAug 22, 2018\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\nFrom Gaming to Gumball: The Rise of FaZe Clan\n\n\n\nBy Khal\n\n\n\nAug 21, 2018\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nTravis Scott on Executive Producing \'NBA 2K19\' Soundtrack: \'It\'s an Honor\'\n\n\n\nBy Joe Price\n\n\n\nAug 15, 2018\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\nMaster Chief Will Be a Main Character in Showtime\'s \'Halo\' Series\n\n\n\nBy Mike DeStefano\n\n\n\nAug 11, 2018\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nGermany Now Allowing Nazi Symbols in Video Games \'That Critically Look at Current Affairs\'\n\n\n\nBy Victoria Johnson\n\n\n\nAug 10, 2018\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\nNintendo Announces New \'Super Smash Bros Ultimate\' Characters Following Luigi\'s Death\n\n\n\nBy Victoria Johnson\n\n\n\nAug 8, 2018\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns Roasts Zach LaVine\'s Video Game Skills, His Dad Confirms He\'s \'Trash\'\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Mansfield\n\n\n\nAug 7, 2018\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\n\'Minecraft\' Movie Delayed As It Loses Writer and Director\n\n\n\nBy Eric Skelton\n\n\n\nAug 5, 2018\n\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\n\nNegan from \'The Walking Dead\' Will Be New Playable Character in \'Tekken 7\'\n\n\n\nBy Eric Skelton\n\n\n\nAug 5, 2018\n\n\n\nNext Page\n\n\n\nMore Stories\n\n\n\nComplex Cover\n\n\n\nASAP Rocky Talks New Album \'Testing\' and Working With Kanye West\n\n\n\nWatch Now\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nEminem on How Dr. Dre Prevented Him From Going \'Too Far\' on \'Kamikaze\'\n\n\n\nKevin Gates Drops Two New \'Luca Brasi 3\' Tracks, Including ""Money Long"" Video\n\n\n\nLabel Head Who Signed Mac Miller at 18: \'He Was a True Visionary.

If you are a gamer who wants a wireless connection that does not lag, and that lasts for up to 10 hours between charges this is for you. It has state-of-the-art audio with Dolby 7.1 Headphone Surround Sound, and it is made to be lag free with 2.4 Ghz of power. While this all sounds great, and the manufacturer has a good track record of making quality electronic products, the reviews always tell the story of whether or not this product is a winner with gamers.\n\n\n\nA Word to the Wise for Those Who Wear Glasses\n\n\n\nSeveral reviews have lamented that if you have to wear glasses to be able to play your games, this headset is probably not for you. The earpads, which are made of a faux leather-like material, will make a squeaking noise as they rub against the frame of your glasses. While other Logitech models have cloth earpads that can be replaced, this unit does not.\n\n\n\nOther gamers were very happy with the units – for about a year. After that the headset would slowly start cutting out, until it got to the point of not charging at all.\n\n\n\nOther Reviews From Those Who Loved the Headset\n\n\n\nOther people who have used this brand of headset for a few years, are very happy with it. Almost everyone who has used this headset is amazed at the quality of the audio, with all spectrums, from lows to highs reproduced flawlessly and clearly.\n\n\n\nThere also seems to be a good deal of disagreement over the durability of this headset. Some people reported using them for years with absolutely no problem. Some people reported having to use duct tape to keep them together after as little as two weeks of use. Taking into account these wildly varying reviews, one can only surmise that those who had the most serious problems put the headset through much more use than those who had no problems. But once again, that is only speculation.\n\n\n\nOther Reviews and Observations\n\n\n\nMany people bought this headset for the express purpose of using it on Skype calls. Once again, while many people had nothing but good experiences with this headset, others endured the annoyance of being cut off for up to 8 seconds during a call. Other reviewers noted that before it disconnected, there was an annoying crackling sound that lasted for awhile.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\n\nWith so many conflicting reviews, it is hard to make a definitive call on this headset. Even those who gave the headset a positive review had some problems with connectivity and getting the headset sync’d with the rest of their equipment. Still, if you look at other reviews, this is still one of the best rated wireless headsets on the market.\n\n\n\nSo, if you simply must have a wireless unit, this is probably your best bet. If you have to have something that is more reliable, you may want to consider a wired unit.\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\nLogitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound\n\n\n\nAdvance Wars Guide\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n...

Nobody in their right minds expected a Lego Star Wars game to be one of the best kids game ever made. Everyone fully expected dumbed-down fetch quests, patronisingly simplistic dialogue, day-glo visuals, and a one-button control scheme so that little Kevin - aged four-and-a-half - didn\'t get confused. The sight of this simple, kleptomaniacal, combat-laced platformer belied the fact that here was a game that was nothing short of revelatory in its mass appeal. Full of infectious, warm humour, subtle visual touches and some masterful puzzle design, it was the sort of game that made you want to hug Traveller\'s Tales for getting it . After so much sorrow had been perpetrated in the name of Star Wars (most of all by Lucas himself) here was an object lesson in how to use a behemoth licence without making gamers feel physically ill. The fact that they managed to make it all hang together isn\'t so much despite the Lego connection, but because of it, and it was the biggest surprise of 2005.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the sequel is utterly brilliant, however, is the least surprising fact of 2006.\n\n\n\nRemoving the earnest cod-seriousness that hangs heavy over any Star Wars interpretation, TT uses the whimsy to its advantage, using Lego as means to make light of the subject matter in the best way possible. It takes full advantage of the inherent nostalgia for Lego to allow us to ""walk down two memory lanes at the same time,"" as self-professed youngling Bramwell pointed out last year. Needless to say, tackling the \'original trilogy\' of Episodes IV, V and VI and Lego at the same time is about as potent a mixture as nostalgia gets for a thirty-something. In this case, it\'s more like striding happily down a memory motorway in an AT-ST, blasting the traffic asunder.\n\n\n\nDarth Solo!\n\n\n\nDon\'t worry Chewy, they\'re armless.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II kicks off in Mos Eisley Cantina in much the same way that the original put you in Dexter\'s diner - except you can wander over to a character customisation section and build yourself some crazed mutated abomination using the heads and bodies of familiar names, and settle on your weapon of choice. With that out of the way, you can kick off A New Hope and work your way chronologically through six chapters per \'episode\', or clear the first chapter and move onto the other Episodes as you see fit.\n\n\n\nJust like the original, the gameplay\'s the same moreish concoction of combat, puzzling, occasional platforming as well as some flight combat sorties to break things up. You can pretty much guarantee that most levels start off with a quick battle against some Stormtroopers and various Imperial guards, and then require a bitof puzzling in order to open a specific door, or negotiate your party across inaccessible areas before you\'re forced to get the blaster or lightsaber out again.\n\n\n\nAs such, the combat\'s easily the most disappointing element of the Lego Star Wars games, and the sequel hasn\'t really addressed this in any meaningful sense. Using an over simplified auto aim system, the blaster or bowcaster takes care of almost every enemy in the entire game with one or two shots to the extent that it even takes care of distant targets on overhead gantries. It\'s certainly a helpful means of making sure kids will enjoy great success, but the drawback is that it makes the lightsaber feel hopelessly clunky and ineffective by comparison. In close combat situations, the Jedi characters can literally squeeze the life out of anyone with their Force Choke move, but it takes far longer to see off a gaggle of enemies all heading for you if you try and swish the lightsaber in their direction than if you simply switch to someone who\'s handy with a blaster. The melee moves never feel quite right, but any limitations of the design are completely offset by the amount of mindless fun you have in simply smashing up one after the other. Each character has its own specific melee move as well, so it\'s initially a lot of fun to see Leia slapping enemies indignantly, or Chewy ripping their arms off.\n\n\n\nTeam leader\n\n\n\nHan Solo\'s expression gets us every time.\n\n\n\nWhere the gameplay really comes into its own is in its approach to puzzles. At first it might involve little more than rebuilding a pile of loose Lego pieces into, say, a ramp for R2-D2 or the hapless C-3PO to get up, but as the game progresses it becomes an ever more complex, and genuinely hilarious process. In scenes that would make the A-Team\'s creations seem credible, a random pile of bricks gets transformed (with an excellent flurried animation) into a little truck for someone to ride around in (for no apparent reason), or, more hilariously, a radio or little disco for the natives to rock out to. Later, elaborate, multi-part constructions help you destroy obstacles and rebuild switches, passkey doors, grapple points and anything that the level designers could think of. You can sense they had a lot of fun while making the game, and this knowing nod to the absurdity of what you\'re doing makes it a real pleasure to chip your way through - if only to see what they can come up with next.\n\n\n\nAs simple as the game seems to begin with (A New Hope being especially easy), by the time you\'ve reached Return of the Jedi, some of the puzzles are a real test of your resolve. Although the solution is never far away, many times we were stumped because of the simple failure to destroy a seemingly innocuous item first. Our advice: shoot everything. At the very least you\'ll earn a stack of bolts for it, which you\'ll quickly realise is vitally important to unlocking the dozens of characters and extras in the game.\n\n\n\nOnce again, all of the game\'s 18 main chapters are designed very much as a co-operative experience regardless of whether you\'re playing it alone or in two-player mode with a pal. At all times you\'re accompanied by at least one other appropriate cast member (and sometimes five or more trail around after you), and this not only allows a friend to drop in on the action at any time in the game, but mean that you can quickly walk up to any one of the other characters and take control of them. Not only does this help in combat situations (with certain characters lacking weapons of any description), but means you can bypass certain security devices, or take advantage of certain special moves, like R2-D2\'s ability to hover across otherwise unreachable gaps, or Luke Skywalker\'s useful double-jump ability. Force powers, in particular, become essential puzzle-solving abilities, with the Jedi\'s able to haul heavy items (that glow blue to let you know you can move them) to enable you to piece together specific items or destroy obstacles.\n\n\n\nDe-railed\n\n\n\nDon\'t mess with Leia, Darth, she might slap.\n\n\n\nWith no shortage of famous vehicular sequences to draw upon, we get to indulge in a number of superb, fast-paced sequences, such as the landspeeder in the Forest of Endor, or the X-Wing in the Death Star trenches, or the epic final Millennium Falcon destroy/escape sequence in Return of the Jedi. These sections, in particular, are ace, all off the rails to allow you to fly the ships yourself, dragging missiles around with you and launching them with slingshot precision. The control\'s fluid, responsive and the action\'s relentlessly exciting, but, man, they\'re the noisiest levels ever . Be warned!\n\n\n\nIn addition, many of the \'normal\' levels now come with a variety of vehicles to leap in and out of, allowing you to stomp around in the lethal AT-STs, taking out hordes of enemies with your laser cannon and squishing the stragglers. Elsewhere, you can hop into a dewback and chomp anyone who gets in your way, or simply use the banthas to reach inaccessible platforms.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the greatest improvement to the already excellent design is the way Lego Star Wars II tempts you back for more with a host of unlockable extras and rewards. Hidden throughout all the main story chapters are numerous collectables that are somewhat off limits to you the first time through. For example, several times you\'ll encounter areas that inform you that \'only Bounty Hunters can access here\', or you\'ll see a security door that only C-3PO can enter, and this is where freeplay comes in. By giving you the ability to switch characters on the fly, with a flick of the shoulder button you can play as Darth Vader one minute, switch to R2-D2 to open a door, before switching back to someone with grappling abilities. In no time you\'ll have hoovered up all manner of secret loot, gained \'True Jedi\' status, and all the ship parts lying around. Unlike the original, gathering all the mini-kit pieces does more than simply build a ship outside the Cantina. The determined among you will find another two vehicle-based levels per Episode to unlock - extending the game\'s overall longevity enormously. Given that the three Episodes take over ten hours to polish off on your first run-through, it safe to say that game directors Tom Stone and Jonathan Smith definitely listened to the feedback over the original\'s length and replayability.\n\n\n\nBad hair day\n\n\n\nClassic Wookie-disguise. Apparently he\'s not fooling this lot...\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, with character design as intentionally simplified as this, Lego Star Wars II was never going to be a game to test the 360\'s capabilities to any great extent, but that\'s not to say the game doesn\'t look the business. Sure, you\'re buying into the sharpest, cleanest version of them all (and have 29 tough achievements to unlock if you\'re into the Gamerscore war), but the visuals get by on the hilarious animation, the stupendous cut-scenes and the delightful attention to detail in every corner of the game. As before, you might get a little riled with the inability to shift the camera angle, but the good far outweighs the bad, and occasionally we get treated to some delightful sequences - check out the Endor forest level, for instance, or some of the space combat sorties. The final level even reminded us of Rez. Which is nice.\n\n\n\nAnd who could fail to fall in love with the character design? No matter how simplified, you always know which one\'s Han Solo, which one\'s Princess Leia, and seeing the end sequence where Luke pulls off Darth\'s helmet is worth the price tag alone. The endless small expressions and non-verbal grunts in the dialogue-free cut-scene are just joyous, and well worth repeat viewing. It\'s a twisted, comic re-imagining of the Star Wars universe, but in the most respectful way possible. It certainly beats any number of the serious attempts at making a Star Wars game, that\'s for sure.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the only downside about Lego Star Wars II is that the melee combat remains weak throughout, some of the latter puzzles can be wilfully obscure, and that Traveller\'s Tales neglected to allow co-op to be played online. Apart from that, it\'s one of the most instantly enjoyable games around, and were it not for the humbling price tag, we\'d demand you go out and add it to your collection immediately. Whether you\'re 3 or 33, this is one of those rare games that can genuinely appeal to everyone whether you\'re into Star Wars or not.\n\n\n\n8 /10\n\n\n\nRead the Eurogamer.net reviews policy\n\n\n\nSometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Whether it was the simple pick up and play mechanics or the idea of squeezing an entire trilogy into such a small package, complete with hilarious cut-scenes, there is no question that this game was loved by just about anyone who played it. So how do you follow-up such a fun and unique idea? Well for starters you bring back all the things that made the original great, fix any problems, oh and of course base it on the original trilogy just so we can play through the game as Slave Leia. Traveller’s Tales has stumbled onto something special here and this sequel is certainly a worthy follow-up to last year’s biggest surprise.\n\n\n\nThe core game itself is setup just like the original. This time around Mos Eisley Cantina will serve as your hub where you can choose missions, discover secrets, and even drop by the bar to purchase unlockables such as extra characters. The game covers the original Star Wars trilogy and is broken up into three chapters respectively. Each chapter is broken down into several missions that attempt to convey the entire story without all the cheesy dialogue. In fact just like the first entry in the series you will never hear a word of spoken dialogue and still be able to follow what is going on, and that is certainly no small feat for any developer.\n\n\n\nWhen was the last time you took me out for a nice dinner?!?\n\n\n\nOf course being a fan of the trilogy doesn’t hurt, in fact avid fans will certainly get a kick out of some of the inside jokes that developer Traveller’s Tales has thrown into the mix. For starters they seemed to have stuck to the original theatrical releases and not the special editions so expect to see Han shoot first and of course end out the game with the infamous Ewok song on Endor.\n\n\n\nFor anyone who didn’t get a chance to play the original game don’t fret, it is certainly not required to enjoy the sequel. The premise of LEGO Star Wars is basically a simplified action title with minimal puzzles and lots of platform jumping. The player can control several characters per level in story mode all by switching in between heroes at the push of a button. You can also re-visit any level you have already completed with any of the characters you have unlocked during your previous progress.\n\n\n\nThis opens up a whole new world of replayability as each level has designated areas that are only accessible by certain characters such as bounty hunter missions, Stormtrooper encrypted areas, and of course places that only a Jedi can reach. There are also a ton of hidden items and things to collect that will require more than one play through of each level just to find everything. You can also unlock the ability to swap character pieces with one another creating some unlikely concoctions such as Darth Vader wearing Princess Leia’s slave outfit and so much more. It is like having a virtual set of Star Wars LEGOs directly at your fingertips.\n\n\n\nWhile the main game can easily be finished within 3-4 hours the extras can keep you playing for well over twenty hours, not to mention the co-op. Speaking of multi-player this is one of my biggest complaints about LEGO Star Wars II. While you can easily drop in and out of two-player mode at any given time there is absolutely no online play. This is a huge blow as this game could certainly benefit from it. Sure playing on one console is fine and dandy, but the option to take it online via Xbox Live or any other online service would have made the already sweet package even better. This is even more stressed with the fact that playing solo can sometimes frustrate you because of the dumb-as-rocks AI in the game. I literally have watched my AI partner block every single attack the enemy throws without ever even attempting to take them out of the equation. Thankfully they do serve a purpose as every level has certain characters that you have to take on your journey to progress through the level, but online play would have made this much less of a chore seeing as how you could play with a real person anytime you desired.\n\n\n\nSometimes it is not wise to let the Wookie win.\n\n\n\nThis time around Traveller’s Tales has also placed a greater emphasis on vehicles with many fan favorites such as the Landspeeder and Dewback making appearances. There are even levels designed solely around using these new modes of transportation including the Death Star Run and the Speeder Bike chase on Endor. And yes as always there is a Hoth level complete with Snowspeeder toe cables and AT-ATs to take out, who didn’t see that one coming?\n\n\n\nThe visuals in LEGO Star Wars II are definitely not going to set your HDTV on fire, but for what it is the game does a great job of conveying the atmosphere. Being released on just fewer than ten consoles and every single one of them being almost identical is a sign that visuals were certainly not the priority of this endeavor. Character animation has been beefed up and the Xbox 360 version sports some gorgeous reflections and of course that 720p shine, but in general every version looks almost identical including the PSP outing, minus of course the atrocious load times. All your favorite tunes from composer John Williams are present and the sound effects are directly lifted from the Lucas archives, but as I mentioned earlier you will not hear one word of spoken dialogue unless the subtle howling of a Wookie counts.\n\n\n\nWhile this recycles most of what made the original so much fun it still deserves credit for adding onto an already solid formula. If you enjoyed the first game and aren’t expecting a revolution in gaming you will find more than enough to keep you busy with this extremely solid sequel. Fans of Star Wars in general need to play this game and anyone looking for a break from all the shooters, racers, and RPGs flooding the market today owe it to themselves to check out this simple, yet highly addictive little action title.\n\n\n\nWritten by\n\n\n\nKen McKown\n\n\n\nKen is the Editor-in-Chief of this hole in the wall and he loves to troll for the fun of it.

Year after year, good players bolt to the NBA like John Madden to a free buffet at Sizzler, swayed by huge salaries, instant ad contracts and a lifetime of Escalades and MTV Crib specials.\n\n\n\nBut despite this mass migration, the NCAA trudges on. Basketball fans still appreciate the work ethic of college ballplayers, and even though ití¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to know anyoneí¢â‚¬â„¢s name since they go pro so quickly, you can always just root for your alma mater and root against Duke, or in my case, Stanford.\n\n\n\nVideo game basketball follows a similar rule. In the past, weí¢â‚¬â„¢ve all rooted for EAí¢â‚¬â„¢s March Madness games because they were really the only decent thing out there. Though thereí¢â‚¬â„¢s more competition these days, NCAA March Madness 2004 still gets an automatic bid with its gameplay and depth, though a few hitches and an overall lack of polish keep it from the national title.\n\n\n\nMuch of March Madness 2004 has been lifted right out of EAí¢â‚¬â„¢s NBA Live 2004 í¢â‚¬Â¦which is a good thing. The control is exactly the same, including the right analog stick Freestyle moves, the two different shoot and layup/dunk buttons and the insanely useful pro hop button. They all work more or less just like in Live, though the Freestyling isní¢â‚¬â„¢t as smooth. The pro hop is a great idea on paper, allowing your player to pick up his dribble for a quick two step drive to the basket, but leads to an unnerving number of easy layup and dunks.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, NCAA March Madness 2004 differentiates itself from Live by way of its college game playbooks and defense. You can choose from a nice assortment of plays on the fly, which youí¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to use at the higher difficulty levels where the AI starts throwing all kinds of nasty zones at you. Penetrating the lane isní¢â‚¬â„¢t always a cinch despite the pro hop button, which is very much true to the college game. Youí¢â‚¬â„¢ll often have to swing the ball around the perimeter for a while before you spot an opening.\n\n\n\nCareful with that swinging, though, because the AI plays the passing lanes ruthlessly. Passes are picked and shots are blocked often by both the CPU and the player. The press is particularly vicious; the CPU tends to throw bad passes when trying to break it, which can lead to some insane scoring runs. It makes for a more frantic game, but when four of your five starters are All-Defensive team in your conference, ití¢â‚¬â„¢s a little suspect.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the gameplay is handled decently, although offensive rebounding gets annoying as players tend to go for the dunk follow instead of just trying to grab the ball. But when things get moving, it all flows well enough.\n\n\n\nPart of the reason it works out is that March Madness rips a page out of NBA Live again with its 10-man motion capture. Players really move around on the court; incidental animations, such as two forwards jostling for position on the low block, give the game a jolt.\n\n\n\nThat jolt might be mistaken for a frame hiccup, unfortunately, especially if youí¢â‚¬â„¢re playing the PS2 version. The graphics just arení¢â‚¬â„¢t very smooth. Player models are overly blocky and the faces are primitive. While dunk and layup animations look good, players slide around a lot; presumably some frames were dropped while converting Live into March Madness . The Xbox version solves some of the problems with cleaner lines and a steadier framerate, but neither version looks very good at all.\n\n\n\nThey both sound okay thanks to tons of fight songs and great ambient crowd noises like chants and cheers. Brad Nessler and Dick Vitale call the shots, which is either good or bad depending heavily on how you feel about Dickey V. Even fans of the guy will probably get irritated because of the repetition: í¢â‚¬Å“The college game, baby! Thereí¢â‚¬â„¢s nothiní¢â‚¬â„¢ like it, baby! These kids play hard, baby! You gotta love it, baby!í¢â‚¬? We know, Dick, we bought the game. I think heí¢â‚¬â„¢s starting to sound a bit like Special Ed from Crank Yankers .\n\n\n\nBut while NCAA March Madness 2004 drops the ball in its delivery, it picks it up again in its breadth of modes and depth. One new mode, Mascot game, turns all of your players into the team mascot; five Cal Bears versus five Stanford Trees! Nice try, albeit kinda lame. Rivalry games are also here, providing a quick way to play a Big Game.\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the single-player is found in Dynasty mode, which is very similar to what youí¢â‚¬â„¢ll find in EAí¢â‚¬â„¢s own NCAA Football 2004 . You can play as any Division I team (theyí¢â‚¬â„¢re all here) through a bunch of seasons. You can get stats on the whole NCAA, set coaching strategies and training sessions for your team, tweak your roster endlessly and during the off-season sign and recruit high school players to replace your star forward who just went pro.\n\n\n\nIf you doní¢â‚¬â„¢t have a favorite school or have always dreamt of starting your own, you can Create-A-School and import it into Dynasty. The choices are rather plain, but ití¢â‚¬â„¢s a cool addition for those who either flunked out of college or have yet to go.\n\n\n\nBe warned, however, that the PS2 loading times are rough, particularly during Dynasty as you switch between different menu options or load and save games. Before playing a game, March Madness will simulate all other games up to that point, which can take literally two minutes if, say, your team had a two-week break between games. The Xbox is a bit faster here, but get used to unintended bathroom breaks either way.\n\n\n\nThe PS2 version is online, which works well enough provided you find a good opponent with a fast connection. Xbox owners have yet another reason to send hate mail to EA since the green machine isní¢â‚¬â„¢t online at all.\n\n\n\nNCAA March Madness 2004 definitely feels like a college game, from its customizable front end (based on your favorite school) to the video tips provided by real college coaches. However, it doesní¢â‚¬â„¢t feel like a very polished game. More attention to the graphics and gameplay issues would secure its place as the preeminent college basketball game. Right now, though, ití¢â‚¬â„¢s still on the bubble.\n\n\n\nREVOLUTION REPORT CARD\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\nNBA LIve 2004 mechanics\n\n\n\nGood Dynasty mode\n\n\n\nGreat college atmosphere\n\n\n\nMediocre graphics and sound\n\n\n\nNumerous gameplay flaws\n\n\n\nLong load times\n\n\n\nShare this story on facebook\n\n\n\nSHARE\n\n\n\nShare this story on twitter\n\n\n\nTWEET\n\n\n\nAvailable Now\n\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\nWe Happy Few\n\n\n\nMac / PC / PS4 / Xbox One\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\nSpider-Man (2018)\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\nMOTHERGUNSHIP\n\n\n\nPC / PS4 / Xbox One\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\nOctopath Traveler\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\nWarioWare Gold\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\nMario Tennis Aces\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\nThe Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit\n\n\n\nPC / PS4 / Xbox One\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nRating\n\n\n\nStar Citizen\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\n12-31-2018\n\n\n\nCode Vein\n\n\n\nPS4 / Xbox One\n\n\n\n12-31-2018\n\n\n\nPhoenix Point\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\n12-01-2018\n\n\n\nThe Good Life (2018)\n\n\n\nPC / PS4\n\n\n\n12-31-2018\n\n\n\nPokemon Let\'s Go Pikachu and Let\'s Go Eevee\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch\n\n\n\n11-16-2018\n\n\n\nWWE 2K19\n\n\n\nPC / PS4 / Xbox One\n\n\n\n10-08-2018\n\n\n\nEditor\'s Pick\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\nContact GR\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\n\nGrading System\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\n\nAdChoices\n\n\n\nGameRevolution.com is a property of Mandatory Media, LLC, an Evolve Media, LLC company. ©2018 All Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\nGameRevolution\n\n\n\nChartbeat\n\n\n\nmonitoring_string = ""9825918b2b361fb0e003f4935ce18ae6""', ""html\n\n\n\nEsquire - Men's Fashion, Cocktails, Politics, Interviews, and Women\n\n\n\nStyle\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nFood & Drink\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nGive a Gift\n\n\n\nDigital Editions\n\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n\nUS\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nPrint Edition\n\n\n\nDigital Edition\n\n\n\nGive a Gift\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nTV\n\n\n\nMovies\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nMusic\n\n\n\nStyle\n\n\n\nStyle\n\n\n\nFashion\n\n\n\nGrooming\n\n\n\nAccessories\n\n\n\nBig Black Book\n\n\n\nFood\n\n\n\nFood\n\n\n\nRestaurants\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nDrinks\n\n\n\nDrinks\n\n\n\nBars\n\n\n\nCocktail Recipes\n\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\nSex & Relationships\n\n\n\nCars & Tech\n\n\n\nFitness & Health\n\n\n\nMoney & Career\n\n\n\nNews & Politics\n\n\n\nNews & Politics\n\n\n\nCharles P.

Despite plenty of promising reviews, I myself fell victim to this initial and mildly idiotic opinion, but a chance encounter was to mean that the pure blissful brilliance of Lego Star Wars was about to hit me as hard as a swift knee to the happy-sacks. During a routine visit to my brotherâ€™s house, my eldest nephew was happily caning the game in the living room. After ten minutes of watching him hack, slash and blast his way through a horde of robots, he eventually decided to nip to the toilet, his PS2â€™s Dual Shock sat tempting me to have a go. Checking the coast was clear, slightly embarrassed by the prospect of picking up a kidâ€™s game, I swallowed my pride and started a level. What happened next was something that hadnâ€™t happened for a while during a gaming session; I smiled and laughed to myself, captivated ironically in a similar fashion as to when I saw the original Star Wars trilogy as a child myself all those years ago. The game was fun, with great simple play and had a very dry and sophisticated humour; I was sold, and bought it that same week. Now finally, developers Travellers Tales have given us\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\n, has it lived up to or even bettered upon its predecessor? Hit the next link to find outâ€¦\n\n\n\nA long, long time agoâ€¦ The story of the original and far superior Star Wars Trilogy is something that everyone should know and experience at some point in their lives. If you havenâ€™t then I seriously suggest that you get yourself to you local DVD rental store as soon as humanly possible. For those who have been living under a rock for their entire lives, the story goes something like this: A young farm boy by the name of Luke Skywalker embarks on a fantastical journey with the help of his Jedi mentor, Obi Wan Kenobi, on a bid to take down the evil Empire who are at rule over the universe. As the name suggests, Lego Star Wars 2: The Original Trilogy covers all of the original Star Wars films, and each is wonderfully interpreted in its Lego incarnation. As with the previous game, Travellers Tales have managed take the key moments from all three films and have reinvigorated them adding a deft touch of humour to proceedings, making each one that little bit more memorable. The developers have perfectly nailed the humour, and it’s certainly not something thatâ€™s simply there to help make it even more accessible to children, there are times in the story that I genuinely laughed out loud, and include moments that will stay with me forever, thereâ€™s certainly no cheap laughs involved here.\n\n\n\nUse the controller Lukeâ€¦ Lego Star Wars 2â€™s core gameplay has changed very little from the previous title, however this isnâ€™t a bad thing at all. Playing out as a basic platformer, but also successfully fusing hack â€˜nâ€™ slash, shooter, and puzzle elements, there is never a dull moment due to the amount of variety that is on offer. Just to add a little more to that variety, we have more flying sections than the previous game, which really arenâ€™t that dissimilar to the old top down shooters of yesteryear. The controls themselves are very simple to get to grips with, but do have enough depth to stop the game becoming brain numbingly boring. When you venture out into any level for the first time, you are forced to follow the set storyline structure. Once any level is complete you are then able to go through again in freeplay mode as often as you like to get the rest of the collectables. In this mode you choose from any two of the unlocked characters, and are given a further set including all the unit classes that are required to complete the core objectives.\n\n\n\nIâ€™ve mentioned the word â€˜collectables’ above; make a note of that, as it is a key word as far as Lego Star Wars is concerned. Hoarding is something youâ€™ll be busying yourself with if you want to 100% this game, whether it be collecting as many coins as possible to break the â€˜True Jediâ€™ rating in each level, and to purchase more characters and extras from the Cantina base level, or itâ€™s gold bricks to open up yet more levels and modes. Making their return from the previous game are the legendary hidden Mini-kits, which are littered around all the levels. Once again as previously, the more kits that are unlocked from each level, the more they build up an instantly recognizable Star Wars vehicle outside the Cantina. Once some of the models are completed, certain ones become unlocked for use in particular levels. With all this to keep you coming back to each level, coupled with plenty of achievements to win, it becomes apparent that this game isnâ€™t the easy romp you may have thought early on.\n\n\n\nSound and Light (sabers)â€¦ The weakest area of Lego Star Wars 2 comes in its very slight visual superiority over other versions. Aside from adding high-definition to the equation, plus a tiny bit of polish, it would appear that there was very little work put in to make a huge graphical step-up from the last-gen versions. Otherwise, the games design is perfect, presenting an odd balance where the game does feel like an authentic Lego game, but also like fully-fledged Star Wars title. As usual with Star Wars games, the sound effects are absolutely spot-on; with every gun blast, with every saber swipe, and with every vehicle screech, you find yourself sporting an enormous nostalgic Joker-esque grin spanning from ear-to-ear. The characters themselves donâ€™t use full speech; instead utilize mumbling sound-a-like sound bites. This approach serves a thoughtful purpose, offering the developers a far greater variety in the way of visual humour. It’s this area where the game comes into its own.\n\n\n\nThe Force is strong with this oneâ€¦ The million-dollar question that faces those pondering the purchase of Lego Star Wars 2: The Original Trilogy is: â€˜Is it worth the extra twenty pounds over the last-gen version?â€™ This is a question that is made even harder to answer when you consider that the Original Xbox version is actually listed as a backwards-compatible title, it just seems like a particularly odd move. Whichever way you feel about the possible answer to that question, if you buy either version you are still in for a treat as it is worth every penny. Admittedly if you are solely concentrating on the story mode, then you may not be kept occupied for an age, but if you want to complete the game properly you will have to be prepared to put the hours in, because it does take skill. Combining timeless events, great humour, simple yet effective gameplay, and just an astonishing amount of variety all in one little package, itâ€™s hard not to find something about this game that makes you smile. An absolute must for all Star Wars fans, kids and just big kids alike.\n\n\n\nFinal Score: 8 out of 10 ( How do we rate games? )\n\n\n\n«« No wireless Guitar Heroes guitar on 360\n\n\n\n»» XNA Beta 2 released, with a screenshot\n\n\n\nRelated articles (select to read)\n\n\n\n05-08 LEGO Harry Potter Enjoyed By 2.7 Million Gamers\n\n\n\n21-07 Pre-order Bonus for SW: The Force Unleashed II Announced\n\n\n\n07-07 LucasArts Would Love Super Star Wars on Xbox 360\n\n\n\n14-06 E3 2010: Kinect Star Wars Game Revelaed\n\n\n\n09-06 Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II Collector’s Edition\n\n\n\n05-06 First Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II Screens\n\n\n\n22-04 Yoda’s Death Portrayed?\n\n\n\n08-02 LEGO Star Wars III announced\n\n\n\n02-08 Microsoft sorry for Halo Wars mistake\n\n\n\n26-07 SW: The Force Unleashed to revisit retail in new edition\n\n\n\n9 comments on \'Review: Lego Star Wars 2: The Original Trilogy\'\n\n\n\nSubscribe to comments with RSS or Trackback to \'Review: Lego Star Wars 2: The Original Trilogy\'.\n\n\n\nComment by mtbjunkie on 2006-11-06 00:12:26 | Reply\n\n\n\nAgree completly with the review, and would add that this game in 1080i is rad.

After fighting off a particularly frenzied assault by the enemy, you are severely injured while trying to save a compatriot from certain death. Certain that you have reached the end of the line, you’re in for a bit of a surprise when you later wake up a new man. Literally. The doctors were not only able to save your life, but in the process they have turned you into a super-soldier. Implants enhance your natural abilities, as well as giving you powerful new ones. As the game progresses you’ll receive further mods, giving you a very rich set of special abilities by the end of the game. The mods include sight and HUD enhancements that allow you to see through walls or to turn on a very handy objective beacon that will use pulsating circles to direct you to where you need to go. But there’s more here than just visual aids – you will eventually gain the ability to move at super speeds effectively slowing down the world around you in a “bullet time” style effect, to turn yourself invisible for those times when stealth is more prudent than gunfire, and to create a shield around you to protect yourself from damage. Lest these enhancements turn you into an invincible machine and in turn take the fun out of the game, your enhancements require energy and will deplete your energy bar quite quickly. Luckily for you there are also plenty of power-ups to help you recharge.\n\n\n\nI said keep out!\n\n\n\nBacking up your high-tech body is the arsenal of weapons that you’ll have at your disposal. There are the requisite assault rifles, shotguns, and rocket launchers, each with secondary fire modes, but you’ll also have access to some more unique weapons. One is a gun that can fire special projectiles into control consoles, allowing you to hack the computers within. Why risk life and limb fighting a robotic mech or assaulting an automated defense cannon when you can hack into a console and take control yourself? Or you can pick up a pulse rifle that will arc from one enemy to another letting you hit multiple targets with a single shot. Then there’s the interesting Kinetic Kicker that lets you explore the game’s good physics engine by using it to move and fling objects. In addition to the guns there are a variety of grenades from flashbangs to frags that can quickly and easily be thrown with the left trigger.\n\n\n\nWith all of these tools and firepower at your disposal, you can probably imagine that you’re up against some opposition. The game is very action intensive and there are plenty of large battles between your army and the enemy. Of course you’re the star of the show and will rack up more than your fair share of the kills, but your fellow soldiers are competent warriors and fight quite effectively in their own right. The enemy AI is also pretty sharp, effectively using cover, moving from place to place, and taking over heavy weapon mounts after the death of a comrade. You can take a fair amount of damage before succumbing to your wounds, but the enemy will have no trouble stopping you if you take a run and gun approach to the battles.\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 2 »\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view\n\n\n\ncomments.\n\n\n\nRSS Feed Widget\n\n\n\nRecent Comments\n\n\n\nAbout Us ·\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions ·\n\n\n\nPrivacy ·\n\n\n\nFeedback ·\n\n\n\nContacts ·\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nGoogle+\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nDiscord\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nMetacritic\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nGame Rankings\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nPlayer.me\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2001 - 2018, Soltar Enterprises, All Rights Reserved', 'html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""\n\n\n\nmsxbox-world.com\n\n\n\nDiese Domain kaufen.', 'html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""\n\n\n\nWorthplaying | Xbox 360 Review - \'Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\'\n\n\n\nNews Reviews Previews Interviews Events Downloads Search\n\n\n\nGamescom 2018\n\n\n\nCheck out WorthPlaying\'s Gamescom coverage!\n\n\n\nLatest Reviews\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age\'\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'True Fear: Forsaken Souls - Part 1\'\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'Valkyria Chronicles 4\'\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'Shadow of the Tomb Raider\'\n\n\n\nSwitch Review - \'Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack\'\n\n\n\nPC Review - \'Thief of Thieves\'\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'Marvel\'s Spider-Man\'\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'Moss\'\n\n\n\nMore Reviews »\n\n\n\nLatest Previews\n\n\n\nSwitch/PS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'Blacksad: Under the Skin\'\n\n\n\nPS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'Desperados III\'\n\n\n\nPS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'The Surge 2\'\n\n\n\nSwitch/PS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'Trials Rising\'\n\n\n\nPS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'Metro Exodus\'\n\n\n\nPS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'Beyond Blue\'\n\n\n\nPS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'Battlefield V\'\n\n\n\nPS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'The Dark Pictures: Episode 1 - Man of Medan\'\n\n\n\nMore Previews »\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\n\nArchives by Day\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nSu\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n\nTu\n\n\n\nW\n\n\n\nTh\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\nSa\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nPlatform(s): Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Nintendo DS, PC, PSP, PlayStation 2, Xbox Genre: Action Publisher: LucasArts Developer: Travellers Tale\n\n\n\nAbout Chad\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\n\nXbox 360 Review - \'Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\'\n\n\n\nby Chad on Oct. 6, 2006 @ 1:32 a.m. PDT\n\n\n\nWith a comical take on the Star Wars Trilogy that revolutionized pop culture forever, LEGO Star Wars II follows the Rebel Alliance\'s battle to dismantle the Galactic Empire and rebuild a galaxy in pieces. From Darth Vader\'s pursuit of Princess Leia aboard her Blockade Runner to a showdown on the reconstructed Death Star, the game includes even more of the family-friendly LEGO action, puzzles and humor that earned the original LEGO Star Wars such popularity and acclaim.\n\n\n\nGenre: 3D Platformer Publisher: LucasArts Developer: Traveler\'s Tales Release Date: September 12, 2006\n\n\n\nI love Star Wars. Well, let me rephrase that: I love the original ""Star Wars"" movies, the expanded universe novels, and the good games based on it. I don\'t love dressing up like a Stormtrooper or Boba Fett or going to conventions or anything of that nature, but for those of you out there who do, more power to you. When a new Star Wars game is released, gamers and Star Wars fans alike approach with caution, not sure as to whether they\'ll be getting something that\'s Knights of the Old Republic caliber or, you know, Super Bombad Racing . Well, fear not, intrepid readers, for like its prequel, Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy is a fun and refreshing experience from the former category.\n\n\n\nAt the risk of alienating the three or four people who read this who haven\'t seen Episodes IV, V, and VI, I\'m going to forgo summarizing the storyline for the game, although I will say this, preceded by one of those fancy spoiler alerts (though not really): not a drop of Jar Jar contaminates this timeline, my friends. I will say that LSW II takes a much more light-hearted approach to the saga and is at times, genuinely hilarious. With all of the little LEGO characters waddling around, mumbling their cute, incomprehensible LEGO speech instead of the famous lines from the movies, how could it not be?\n\n\n\nCute only gets you so far in a galaxy far, far away, though. How do these characters handle when the blaster bolts are flying? They\'re no pushovers, that\'s for sure. Gameplay-wise, there are three basic different classes of characters: those who wield blasters, Jedi, and droids. Farm boy Luke, Han, Leia, Lando, Chewbacca, etc., take down the opposition from afar, which is ultimately the best way to go about it. They can\'t deflect blaster bolts like the lightsaber-wielding Jedi, but they do have a nifty evade move that comes in handy when the stormtroopers start flooding in.\n\n\n\nBlaster-wielding characters also have grappling hooks attached to their weapons, which allow them to ascend to areas that would otherwise be unreachable to those not sensitive to the Force, but the hooks can only be used on specially marked parts of the ground. Jedi do most of their fighting close up, preferring their lightsabers (""an elegant weapon from a more civilized age"") to the crudeness of blasters. The problem with this, however, is that should they get right next to an enemy, the hit detection goes haywire as the saber is clearly going right through their foe, but no damage is being done. This makes Jedi a little less appealing when it comes to combat. Finally, there are the droids. The droids are really just there to open doors that others can\'t, which happens frequently.\n\n\n\nThe combat isn\'t going to blow anyone\'s mind, but some of the puzzles might. I don\'t know if this is common knowledge or not, but apparently, people like to build things out of LEGO pieces. So, it makes sense that people who are LEGOs do it with such gusto and joy that it puts our pitiful human efforts to shame. Get them next to a pile of unassembled pieces, and no matter what character you currently control, he/she/it will go to town building all manner of things out of the many different blocks. Typically, you\'ll need to use whatever they build to further advance in the level or to take down a platoon of Stormtroopers heading your way. Most of the game\'s puzzles will require you to use every type of character in your traveling party in order to solve a particular puzzle. For instance, a ramp will need to be built for a droid to access a door only it can unlock, but after building it, you\'ll need a Jedi character to move it to the proper area with a little push from the Force. This makes every character with you not feel like dead weight that you have to drag across the level, but rather an essential part of your group.\n\n\n\nMaking a return in LSW II are various vehicles that characters can hop into when the need arises. On terrestrially based levels, they usually amount to Tauntauns or dewbacks that are fun for a little bit (come on, who wouldn\'t want to ride a tauntaun?) but ultimately serve no purpose in the overall gameplay. However, there are quite a few levels that have you piloting various mechanical marvels, such as AT-STs, X-wings, TIE Fighters, the Millennium Falcon, and many others. It takes a little time to get used to piloting the snub fighters and the Falcon, as the view switches to isometric and the controls don\'t feel as intuitive as they do when touching down on terra firma, but after a few minutes, you\'ll be blasting bogeys out of sky, lassoing AT-ATs, and destroying Death Stars with the best of them.\n\n\n\nTraveler\'s Tales could\'ve easily just ported the current-gen version of Lego Star Wars II over to the 360, thrown in some achievements, and called it a day. Luckily for us, though, they took advantage of some of the 360\'s additional graphics capability and added a few nice touches. All of the LEGO characters reflect light, for instance, just like their real-world, plastic counterparts do. There\'s also a neat camera-focusing technique that makes objects in the background appear unfocused, like objects that are far away from what a person is currently looking at in real life. Otherwise, the graphics definitely maintain a high level of cuteness. If you see LEGO C-3PO waddle around for the first time and don\'t think to yourself, ""Awwww, look at that little fella open that locked door!"" then you, my friend, have no soul.\n\n\n\nOne thing you can always count on a Star Wars game for is great sound design, and LSW II does not disappoint. From the epic John Williams score to the snap-hiss sound of a newly ignited lightsaber, everything is in its place and sounds exactly as it should in the movies. The dialog consists solely of mumbles and grumbles, as mentioned before, but this in no way hurts the manner in which the game retells the story of the original trilogy. It actually helps with the title\'s silly sense of humor, which is something you\'re going to have to make peace with if you\'re going to enjoy the game.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II has replay value for miles and is its biggest selling point. I\'m not usually one for the Banjo-Kazooie and Star Fox Adventure item-collecting extravaganza, but I felt compelled to collect every single stud, mini-kit, and gold brick that I could, my main reason being that I wanted to unlock every single character, and there are many of them. Most will run you a couple of thousands studs in the Mos Eisley Cantina (the hub around which you access missions and spend your studs), but the more popular characters, such as everyone\'s favorite bounty hunter, Boba Fett, will run you quite a bit more. The seamless two-player co-op that allows a friend to drop in and out of the game whenever they wish will also have you coming back for more with a buddy, especially since AI-controlled allies are dumb as dirt and ever more useless.\n\n\n\nLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy certainly looks like a kid\'s game, but its appearance hides a surprisingly challenging experience that gamers of all ages will enjoy. It certainly won\'t revolutionize the genre by any means, but even people who aren\'t huge Star Wars nerds would do well to at least give this one a rental and see what all of the fuss has been about.\n\n\n\nScore: 7.3/10\n\n\n\nMore articles about\n\n\n\nLEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\n\n\n\ncomments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\nblog comments powered by\n\n\n\nDisqus\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nReviewers\n\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\n\n\n\'Aggelos\' (ALL) Update Adds Hard Mode, Langauge Localizations\n\n\n\nVarious Game Trailers #2734\n\n\n\nSwitch/PS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'Blacksad: Under the Skin\'\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age\'\n\n\n\n\'8 to Glory: The Official Game of the PBR\' (ALL) Gets...\n\n\n\nEverything else\n\n\n\nJoin Us!\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n©2000-2018 Worthplaying']",2006-09-12,"Lego Star Wars II's gameplay is from a third-person perspective, and takes place in a 3D game world that contains objects, environments and characters designed to resemble Lego pieces. Its gameplay—a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (2005). While Lego Star Wars followed the events of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs – small, disk-shaped objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.The game's central location is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport bar on the planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the Death Star, and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level as well as a Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.Three types of secret items are available: gold bricks, minikits, and power bricks. Within each level is hidden one power brick. When a power brick is collected, its corresponding extra, such as invincibility or stud multipliers, becomes available for purchase. Each level also contains ten hidden minikits, that is, ten pieces of a Star Wars vehicle. When all ten have been collected, the player is awarded a gold brick. Collecting a certain number of gold bricks unlocks free rewards, such as a spigot that spews out studs. Gold bricks are also awarded when levels are completed, and when a predefined number of studs is accumulated in a level; ninety-nine gold bricks are available. The vehicles represented by the minikits are displayed outside the cantina. As each vehicle is completed (all ten minikits collected), it becomes available for play in a bonus level.



=== Playable characters ===



Over 50 characters from the films are playable over the course of the game, including variations of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, C-3PO, Darth Vader, Wicket the Ewok, and Boba Fett. Character abilities have a greater role in Lego Star Wars II than in Lego Star Wars. Certain characters armed with guns can use a grappling hook in predesignated areas. Characters wielding lightsabers can deflect projectiles, double jump and use the Force. R2-D2, C-3PO, and other droid characters are needed to open certain doors. Small characters like the Ewok and Jawa can crawl through hatches to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Bounty hunters, such as Boba Fett, may use thermal detonators to destroy otherwise indestructible objects. Sith, like Darth Vader, can use the Force to manipulate black Lego objects. Some characters have unique abilities; for example, Chewbacca can rip enemies' arms from their sockets, Darth Vader can choke enemies with the Force, Princess Leia possesses a slap attack, and Lando Calrissian can use a kung-fu-like attack. Special abilities are often necessary to unlock secrets, and story mode does not always provide characters with needed abilities.  This means that some secrets can only be found in free play mode. The player can unlock the ""Use Old Save"" extra, which imports all unlocked characters from Lego Star Wars for use in free play; however, a Lego Star Wars saved game must be present on the same memory card that contains Lego Star Wars II's save data.Players can create two customized characters in the Mos Eisley Cantina. These characters can be built using both miscellaneous parts and those of unlocked characters; 2,258,163,204 combinations are possible.

57872,West of Loathing,Switch,west of loathing,"['[\'it takes a lot of courage to design , program , and release a game with an intentionally crude and simplistic art style , but when you’re basing it off a browser game from 2003 , that’s just what you’ve got to do . west of loathing is an almost entirely monochrome stick figure rpg that hides not only technical depth , but an immeasurable amount of charm , whimsy , and superb writing .\', \'first impressions are always important , and the first impressions you’ll find here are unforgettable . as you wander around your parents’ house you’ll be interacting with bookcases , pets , family members , and if you’re persistent enough , you’ll find some meat ( the game’s primary currency ) , xp , and most importantly , a book which provides you with a perk that makes your character ‘walk’ in a random assortment of ludicrous and impractical ways . does this affect the game in any way at all ? absolutely not , but it’s the perfect way to set you up for what the rest of your time will entail .\', \'in terms of typical gameplay , west of loathing is arguably light . there is a turn - based combat system that is affected by your choice of the three classes , namely beanslinger , cow puncher , and snake oiler . your stats are also affected by various food , booze , and potions you consume each day , and your stomach , liver , and spleen ( ? ! ) counters can be raised in turn to allow you to consume more . this is a system that is easily overlooked but is absolutely vital to getting the most out of each encounter and battle , as your stats , perks , and abilities are also vital for interactions outside of battle , as well .\', \'the combat system itself is interesting enough , with novel mechanics and easy to learn nuances , but on the whole , the main bulk of the game takes place outside of this in simply exploring , interacting with characters and objects , completing side quests , and reading lines and lines and lines of text .\', \'as previously alluded to , the writing is beyond excellent . every instance is packed full of so much irreverent and dry humour to the point that it’s totally and utterly inescapable ; if you’re not a fan of laughing , you’d better steer well clear . various moments even caused us to laugh quite literally out loud , despite being totally alone and with the windows open , disturbing passers - by . whether it’s a grotesquely detailed description of you plunging your hand into a rotten spittoon or receiving a boost to your armour skill called ‘mostly scabs’ because you’ve walked into too many cacti , you’d have to be dead inside not to enjoy the humour this game throws at you .\', ""you could argue that what you’re playing is a text adventure , given the sheer amount of written wordage on screen , but that feels unfair . there are plenty of graphics to chew on , and although they’re simple , there \' s a distinct charm to them that couldn’t be easily recreated by an amateur \' just \' drawing stick figures . they’re simple , but there’s been a lot of thought pumped into each design to give consistency and an intentional crudeness ."", ""you may also feel you’re missing out on certain outcomes and possibilities when playing , and to put it bluntly , you are . replayability is the order of the day , and to only play this through once is to only experience a fraction of the experience . there are \' moral \' choices , the previously mentioned classes , what could be classed as a hidden fourth class if you’re especially dedicated , a selection of companions to choose from , different horses to select , and a wealth of other small factors that tailor your experience each time . you can even indulge yourself in the somewhat - hidden hard mode , which forces you to wear a single hat for the entire duration of the game , and unsurprisingly , it makes everything harder . we foolishly did this on our first playthrough and we can attest that you really shouldn’t , because it \' s one hell of a challenge ."", \'west of loathing is not your average rpg ; in fact we’d go so far as to say you’ve probably never played anything quite like it in your life . its combat won’t blow you away but don’t be lulled into believing that’s what this game is about , as really the whole thing is an adventure in exploration and interaction with a bit of fighting sprinkled in . it can occasionally be a little bit difficult to decipher , but the satisfaction felt upon working out a problem totally makes up for it . the humour is as wonderfully dry as the desert you’re traversing and the writing is some of the best you can find on the switch . unless you’ve not got a humorous bone in your body , this is one rpg you can’t risk skipping .\', ""alex is the man responsible for the daily videos you \' ll find on our youtube channel . excitable and fuelled by coffee alone , his floppy hair has charmed many a sceptic into subscribing ."", ""interesting . didn \' t fought it would be any good . i will have to look more into this game"", \'one game kinda on my radar but not really just got bumped up the radar !

so subjective . too many games that push themselves as being funny can wind up stretching the same tired quips to the point of annoying . some have bad gameplay that you endure to get to the funny bits , and of course , there will be games that don’t click with your sense of humour . west of loathing is an adventure rpg . it’s also a very funny game that at the very least will have you smiling an awful lot .', 'west of loathing ( wol ) is a world of stick figures and hand - drawn scenery . a lot of the look and feel draws from the browser - based mmorpg kingdom of loathing , of which this game is a spin - off . in fact , if you’re still on the fence about this game you can sign up and play kingdom of loathing for free and get some idea of the kind of world wol exists in . in wol it’s an interesting combination of point and click adventure games and turn - based rpgs . play is divided between the map where you pick locations you have discovered and walking around the actual place on the map in a 3d space ( although everything still manages to look like very flat scribbled out drawings ) . when exploring the locations , the game feels very much like the paper mario games or more recent south park rpgs , while very much looking very different to other games .', 'at the beginning you get to choose one of three classes : cow puncher ( warrior ) , bean slinger ( wizard ) and snake oiler ( rogue ) . they all have suitably silly abilities . the snake oiler whipping people with snakes when you’re not filling them full of lead , the bean slinger slinging beans and the cow puncher’s less silly punching . ideally , you’ll want to pick the class that best suits your playstyle , but i never found any class to really be a struggle if you keep your levels up . instead of levelling up and being given a bunch of points to upgrade your stats , you are given xp . if you have enough , you can sink it into any of your stats and skills . i enjoyed being able to choose what i wanted to spend it on but if that isn’t your thing you can let the game spend the points for you .', 'stats can play a big part of what you can and cannot access as dialogue choices and actions you can perform , sometimes it just involves getting more xp and getting those stats up . not everything will be available to you in one playthrough , as quests can play out differently depending on what options your stats allow . to experience everything kol has to offer , you will need more than one playthrough . some quests can have different approaches and outcomes , trying the different classes and several different npc ‘pardners’ . there are several options for pardners who will join you on your journey . each have their own backstory , attacks and buffs , gaining their own xp through killing certain creatures connected to the backstory . you only take one pardner with you , so if you want to get the most out of the dialogue you’ll be replaying a few times . if that sounds daunting , just playing it the once still provides you with a lot of content .', 'west of loathing isn’t a hard game overall . with minimal level grinding and good use of stat buffs , you can make a steady pace through the story , and there are lots to do on the side to help build up xp . i never found the combat too difficult , and it was usually a brief distraction away from progressing with a quest . often being able to deal with obstacles by talking ( or hornswagglin’ ) your way through them as much as fighting someone . while you don’t have a posse alongside you to take on the wild west you do get to bring that ‘pardner’ along with you ( as mentioned earlier } . they’re an npc who will accompany you on your journey , help in fights , and add a bit of extra dialogue and character into the game . depending what pardner you pick , they can also help make dealing with certain enemies a bit easier . for example , doc alice can kill any skeleton in one turn .', 'ultimately , i found you can really make the combat as straightforward or difficult as you want . as a snake oiler , i could pull a snake out of my suitcase to fight for me while i drink potions to buff my stats , or i could just select the ability to fire three bullets at once and brute force my way through . if you do want a challenge some of the side content can provide that . there is also a way early in the game to unlock a hard setting by finding a suitable hat . the combat can also have its fair share of laughs , as it carries the same wordplay and ridiculousness that is throughout the rest of the game . the best part is that the battling works well with the rest of the game . if you do struggle with a fight and lose , there’s no real punishment . when you’re defeated you’ll be booted out of the battle and have gained an ‘anger’ buff , and you can either go do something else or try again . the worst that can happen is that you get too angry and pass out . this just returns you to your room and a slightly longer trip to returning to where you were .', 'so , i’ve mentioned a little bit that west of loathing is a funny game . it’s hard to know what to pick out as an example , knowing any other review would discuss the more stand out moments . for starters , the dialogue is regularly good for a laugh . the game doesn’t take anything seriously , whether it’s silly puns , ridiculous enemies and attacks , and your interactions with anyone . there’s plenty of moments that stand out , whether it’s the narrator’s increasing disgust at you for sticking your hand into spittoons or playing through the whole game with the ‘walking stupid’ perk activated , causing your stick figure to regularly change walking animations from cartwheeling to doing ‘the worm’ dance move around the area ( i left this perk on for the whole game ) . for fans of bureaucracy , there is a whole town dedicated to tedious tasks as you run around trying to file paperwork . this is funnier than it should be and frustrating as you’re reminded of tedious bureaucracy . there are side plots such as collecting ‘nex - mex’ books and finding the necromancer or stopping an invasion of hellcows ( cows from hell naturally ) from returning to terrorise the world ( again ) . there is more to wol besides the comedy in it , i don’t want to downplay that , it’s just a fun game . throughout the game , you’re regularly finding new locations to explore and at any one time , there are usually at least three different things you can tackle at your own pace .', 'the one knock i do have against the game is that there is so much content . if you don’t know what specific order you need to do things or have a certain item at a certain event , you can miss out on side content . you can go well over five hours without knowing some of these side things exist and the game still feels like you’ve gotten so much out of it . if you do want to get the most out of the game prepare to get a guide or wiki out when you start another run so you can see everything you missed the first time around , or i guess get it all right the first time .', 'west of loathing is one of the most fun and funniest adventure / point and click game that i have played in some time . combat rarely gets in the way of the adventure , and everything moves at a good pace to get you back to doing silly things that will keep you smiling through most of the games’ playing time . if you’re looking for a game with laughs that don’t lean too hard on using pop culture references or mean - spirited jokes at peoples’ expense , then west of loathing is worth checking out .', 'west of loathing is one of the most fun and funniest adventure / point and click game that i have played in some time . combat rarely gets in the way of the

. for nintendo switch\', \'nintendo switch system update version 6 . 0 . 0 hits next tuesday\', \'10 changes we want in super smash bros . for nintendo switch\', \'the use of stick figures in west of loathing might , for some , be a little off - putting . it’s an odd visual style in a world seemingly obsessed with high polygon counts and 4k fidelity . however , the choice here , both fits the game perfectly and should also be welcomed for its use , as it allows the superb writing to shine through . while the visuals are very simple , they still impress with the use of expression and shadows , making the world of the wild west come to life . at times , the bold black and white imagery leaps from the screen as our hero wanders dungeons holding aloft a lantern which paints the walls with drastic contrasts of light and dark . it’s rather wonderful to look at for its simplicity .\', \'away from the looks , the game delivers on every other aspect . the game takes place in the years of the wild west and the protagonist , who you create and name , has decided to head out west . from the opening moments on the family homestead , you’re given the choice to play how you want . you might choose to be a hardnosed prospector who hates his small - town life , or you could be a young woman setting out to find her fortune , but will miss her family dearly . because west of loathing is an rpg in the traditional sense , you get to choose the rules of your life and how your character will react .\', \'an example of this is a quest from a few hours into the game . i’d been tasked with helping the sheriff catch some bandits and began sneaking into their camp . the watchman who was posted to lookout had fallen asleep and i was given the option to tiptoe past him , wake him up and fight him , or kill him in his sleep . i went for the latter , which played out interestingly because not only did the game humorously triple check that i wanted to take the man’s life , but when i did , i was given a perk for being ruthless . little decisions like this , which seemingly feel inserted for humour or for interest have actual consequences .\', \'the developers seem to have thought of everything . walking into cactuses repeatedly ends up giving you a perk of being covered in scabs , which boosts your armour stat . combing your hair in the mirror adds moxie and reading books levels up fighting moves or skills . in fact , another interesting decision sees the narrator ( the ai ) auto level up your stats , but you can choose to do it yourself . this opens the game to those who might feel a little daunted by an rpg , with all those items and numbers .\', \'thankfully west of loathing does its best to remain as simple as its look . the battles are turn - based and the left stick browses menus for items and attacks , while the right stick targets opponents . there are three character classes which reference traditional rpg tropes and all are easy to use in a scrap – the menu offers everything from attacking and shooting to first aid and special bullets which add debuffs to enemies . along the way you’ll partner up and expand your party , which adds even more options . there are times when the fights seem overly easy , but i’m sure that depends on how thorough you are with side quests .\', \'quests will do what they always do and provide new items , weapons and experience . so much of your cowboy / cowgirl can be modified for stats . certain hats will adjust armour or spellcasting , holding a charm in your off - hand can increase attack or moxie . everything from clothes to body organs can be tweaked through use of certain items , but this can be scaled back for a more streamlined experience .\', \'where west of loathing really stands out , is in the writing . the team have gone to great lengths to provide bags of humour throughout . it might be in descriptors of items or lines of dialogue , it can also be from the narrator who constantly checks if you’re sure you want to search through a spittoon on the hunt for trinkets . the set pieces are always slapstick and reminiscent of buster keaton and chaplin in their execution , even when you’re tasked with a devious puzzle , the jokes are never far away . to accent these , the plot will occasionally tug at your heartstrings , which the best comedy always does . although the plot revolves around the idea of mad cows rampaging across the west , it doesn’t stop death from being affecting .\', \'while some of the quests can feel a little repetitive after a while – fetch quests can only entertain for so long – they’re usually accompanied by witty lines or puzzles based on environment . playing through the game will trigger so many highlights ; fixing a player piano , discussing the war with a crazy old man , protecting nuns from demons and seeking out the jail door for a useless sheriff . west of loathing is a game you pick up for ten minutes and put down four hours later because you were lost in finding the right item or avenging the deaths of a family . aside from a few tiny flaws here and these , this is a must own game for everyone and one that begs to be played over and again .\', ""dan has been writing about games for a decade and playing them for three times as long . sadly he never owned any nintendo consoles as a kid , so he \' s been making up

talking to various townsfolk opens up new quests and locations and you’ll hop to each one to further your adventure . at times you’ll be entered into battle with either random encounters ( usually with demonic cows , skeletons or goblins ) of other folks as part of your adventure . these battles are played out in a turn - based nature and initially are quite lacklustre . as you advance they become more tactical , if a little repetitive , which is the only real sore mark against the game .', 'after sussing the mechanics and fulfilling your objective , you will be given a blank map and your real adventure begins in the town of dirtwater , and you’ll also take on a partner too ( although not taking one is not recommended ) from a selection of those that you have helped out . then it’ll be a case of exploring the terrain , taking on quests , discovering new locations and engaging in more battles to ensure that you reach the town of frisco , upon which you adventure will end after a fun ( if clichéd ) climactic battle .', 'it’s not just all fast - travelling , random encounters and collecting quests though , many of the missions have puzzles , and require a reasonable amount of grey matter , if not trial and error . later in the game , you’ll be afflicted with a nasty virus , and you’ll probably be backtracking to a quest you overlooked ( i know i did ! ) in order to remove the blight upon your senses . there’s also a technological subplot running behind the scenes too , if you can piece it all together then you’ll have done better than me doing my review play .', 'west of loathing has a decent upgrade system running in the background , and all the xp you earn from quests and fights can be spent on upgrading in a variety of skills . you can enhance your muscle ( strength for melee attacks ) , moxie ( for enhancing shooting ) or mystical ( magic and stuff ) abilities or even other things like grit or even perks you’ve learned . safe - cracking , lock - picking and foraging will benefit you along the way . if you found and read the books for these , of course .', 'the presentation in west of loathing is phenomenal as already noted , and the simple yet melodic soundtrack enhances the experience even further . chirpy tunes in saloons , the tense tones during battles and even a delightful rendition of what sounds like “cotten - eyed joe” to lure out a villains’ hiding spot really hit home . this looks and feels like and hand - drawn western .', 'i cannot recommend west of loathing enough . outside of the over - familiarity with the battles , there’s a deep , funny and compelling story and it’s well worth the money .', 'the amount of humour , fun and character within west of loathing is astounding . repetition in the turn based battles is the only slight in an otherwise amazing game . dlc is on the way too , and i for one cannot wait for it .', 'you must be logged in to post a comment .']"", ""['logitech wireless gaming headset g930

the cause of the dead being arisen . as you expect , it’s not anything groundbreaking in narrative sense , but hot damn , this is one of the funniest games i’ve played in months .\', \'to give everyone a good example of west of loathing’s humor , there is a settings menu with various options such as nerd mode ( turns on descriptions for turn - based battles ) , the ability to turn on

you’re sent out west with your choice of one of three horses and one of three partners . this is where the adventure begins . with your trusty steed , you can explore the map to your leisure , choosing locations found by found by exploring , going on quests for townsfolk , or through random encounters . the map is split into different sections with a main town in each one . these towns contain the bulk of the quests and will often grow after these quests are completed .\', \'they’re still sleep fighting to this day .\', \'quests are usually going to one point and achieving a goal there such as talking to someone and receiving an item , in old adventure game fashion . however , some will have you overcome a puzzle , which are at times gave me a challenge i haven’t experience in

through the quests this way is hassle .\', \'same . that’s how i end up writing reviews at 3am .\', \'when you are able to tackle these quests , the game starts to shine . most of the quests involve talking to someone , obtaining a macguffin , and returning said macguffin to the first person , but the dialogue involved is delightful . there was a case in the game where a quest forced me to run around a “ghost town” ( a town made of ghost buildings and people ) on a series of hi - jinx and bureaucracy . in order to build a bridge , i need a logging permit . in order to get that , i need to give it to town hall . in order to do that , i need it stapled by the stapler in town after the unstapler unstapled the terrible job the stapler did . did i mention that only one person in this town is allowed to staple the papers ?\', \'i hated everyone in this stupid ghost town . but , i loved every minute of that hate .\', \'this crap went on for what felt like hours . and basically , if this were any other game , this would be a massive headache , but west of loathing handles it incredibly well . i kept going because it was a rabbit hole of ridiculous rules in place and i wanted to know where it led , west of loathing is full of these kinds of silly events , which surprisingly builds a lovable world full of idiots . another event that can occur while you’re exploring the map is a combat event . these are usually optional , with the player given an option to run away or fight , but fighting is the best way to level up your skills , which are required to complete certain quests . and while the quests are fantastic , the combat makes the game feel too two - dimensional .\', \'i’m going to punch the hell out of this calf .\', \'the combat system is a grid - styled turn - based system where players can either attack with a melee weapon or use their gun depending on what the enemy is weak to . this ends up becoming shallow , as there are few factors to change how much damage you put out and losing has very little consequences . if you lose a battle , you get angry . if you get angry 4 times , you pass out and end up in your bed on the next day . from what i’ve noticed , the only drawback is losing your food buffs that would have ended at the end of the day anyway .\', \'business is booming , i see .\', \'despite this short downside , west of loathing is a fantastic game if you’re ever in the mood for heavy reading . the team at asymmetric have accomplished to build a large world with such a simple art style and hilarious sidequests .\', \'west of loathing

be taken seriously , and for a while , the style is quite enticing .\', \'your goal is to find your way west . although there is the main plotline , the majority of the game , if you choose to indulge it , is made up of a ton of side content . you’d be cutting yourself short if you just ran through the entire map , so the side content is something you’ll want to take your time with . in fact , the side content works in the same style as the main storyline and its gameplay is almost indistinguishable from the main game . whether you’re fighting violent cows ( yup ) or finding odd items , the side content punches at the same weight as the main story .\', \'unfortunately , the entire game just starts to grow old after not too long . the main reason for this is that the rpg mechanics are exceedingly simple . you control two characters , one of which is a partner you choose at the beginning of the game . there’s very little depth to the combat system . most of the time i would just choose the hardest - hitting weapon in each battle . there’s not much in terms of character strengths and vulnerabilities . the strategy is virtually nonexistent . as a result , though new toys do make for entertaining battles when you first obtain them , most of the fights are just sequences you try to get through .\', \'moreover , a lot of the battles are too easy or excessively difficult . the difficulty curve is not developed to be in tune with the character progression . i imagine this decision was made because the highlight of the game is its quirky and humorous dialogue , but it means that most of the actual rpg isn’t that great .\', \'however , the dialogue itself is rather good for most of west of loathing . i frequently found myself chuckling or thinking : “wow , that was clever . ” there’s an inherent sarcastic and skeptical nature to the story which makes it pretty humorous throughout . the developers also manage to cram in a ton of fictional content that juxtaposes with the otherwise historical setting . seeing cognizant members of the walking dead roaming around the western setting is unexpected and humorous to behold .\', \'west of loathing is a great value for its price and definitely entertaining for what it is . unfortunately , the actual mechanics lack a lot of depth that keep it from being an experience for everyone . a deep rpg experience this is

"" belligerent cows have indeed started raiding people \\\' s homes , wreaking havoc , and killing entire families in their path . this serves as the backdrop for west of loathing \\\' s many events .\', \'for all intents and purposes , this plays out as a cross between an adventure game and a text adventure , with turn - based , non - random battles thrown into the mix . the hero explores 2 . 5d side - scrolling environments and interacts with the scenery much like in an adventure game , with a level of interaction coming close to point - and - click titles , and with an amount of text for describing scenes and events that is close to text adventures of old . interspersed in are turn - based battles that are mostly triggered by the events themselves or by the player \\\' s choices in dialogue trees . battles , however , really do take a back -

defined goal from the get - go , this plays out as a quest to simply discover what awaits next , with new places and side - quests progressively unlocking along the way , some larger in scope , others that are quickly completed and don \' t affect the overarching plot at all ."", \'beyond all this , of course , lies the rpg element of actually growing the player \\\' s strengths , of which he has many . other than things like "" muscle "" ( the hero \\\' s physical strength ) , mysticality , and moxie . . . there are more nonsensical things like grit , glamour , or even "" intimidatin \\\' , "" which may open up new options to get out of certain situations through conversations . upgrading all of these stats is done by manually spending xp earned in battles or by doing any number of random things , like searching drawers or fixing a messy stack of wooden logs . regularly , there will be places or situations where the player will not be allowed to move forward without a high enough stat in a certain category so , in those cases , having xp stored can help unlock the way forward . if that is not the case , different locations in the game make it easy to fight weak enemies that make earning xp rather easy and , besides , stat requirements are usually not so high that grinding should become a huge necessity . after all , pieces of clothing found throughout the game may also help raise the player \\\' s stats . it is a very open - ended system where it isn \\\' t really possible to mess up or become completely stuck .\', ""from what appears to be a very simple looking title come a surprisingly deep adventure that doesn \' t take itself seriously at all and plays that card to its full extent without stopping at anything to surprise gamers . while things may look very simplistic and unrealistic , some effects like the hero \' s lantern in caves and mines shedding light at nearby rocks or mine carts and so on , casting long shadows across the scenery , do give an edgy vibe to the visuals , which means it is certainly not lacking in production values despite its artistic direction . the lack of voice acting actually isn \' t a big issue because character voices will play of their own accord in the back of players \' minds as they read through the hilarious dialogue . music is mostly ambient and expectedly wild west themed . it fits the atmosphere perfectly and enhances it like any good soundtrack should ."", ""there is truly very little to complain about in west of loathing . the amount of text may be off -

affecting quest lines are completely optional .', 'though the game is generally great at giving players the freedom to do what they want , there is some difficulty in producing a character that will be able to do all of the desired side content , which is often gated behind attribute requirements in various forms . there aren’t traditional levels , instead players spend earned experience points on a multitude of upgrade options to skills or base attributes . dealing with the ui for character upgrades , as well as items and equipment , can be an annoyance . west of loathing freely -

offs in character building that help give it a bit more depth , in addition to some crafting and equipment upgrade systems ; certain books will provide new combat skills but in turn apply negative character perks , which is a neat touch . pardners also have growth aspects but this is automatic and much more limited in how they grow ; for example , susie only gets more powerful when killing cows .', 'combat uses a standard turn -

West of Loathing is an almost entirely monochrome stick figure RPG that hides not only technical depth, but an immeasurable amount of charm, whimsy, and superb writing.\n\n\n\nFirst impressions are always important, and the first impressions you’ll find here are unforgettable. As you wander around your parents’ house you’ll be interacting with bookcases, pets, family members, and if you’re persistent enough, you’ll find some Meat (the game’s primary currency), XP, and most importantly, a book which provides you with a perk that makes your character ‘walk’ in a random assortment of ludicrous and impractical ways. Does this affect the game in any way at all? Absolutely not, but it’s the perfect way to set you up for what the rest of your time will entail.\n\n\n\nIn terms of typical gameplay, West of Loathing is arguably light. There is a turn-based combat system that is affected by your choice of the three classes, namely Beanslinger, Cow Puncher, and Snake Oiler. Your stats are also affected by various Food, Booze, and Potions you consume each day, and your Stomach, Liver, and Spleen (?!) counters can be raised in turn to allow you to consume more. This is a system that is easily overlooked but is absolutely vital to getting the most out of each encounter and battle, as your stats, perks, and abilities are also vital for interactions outside of battle, as well.\n\n\n\nThe combat system itself is interesting enough, with novel mechanics and easy to learn nuances, but on the whole, the main bulk of the game takes place outside of this in simply exploring, interacting with characters and objects, completing side quests, and reading lines and lines and lines of text.\n\n\n\nAs previously alluded to, the writing is beyond excellent. Every instance is packed full of so much irreverent and dry humour to the point that it’s totally and utterly inescapable; if you’re not a fan of laughing, you’d better steer well clear. Various moments even caused us to laugh quite literally out loud, despite being totally alone and with the windows open, disturbing passers-by. Whether it’s a grotesquely detailed description of you plunging your hand into a rotten spittoon or receiving a boost to your armour skill called ‘Mostly Scabs’ because you’ve walked into too many cacti, you’d have to be dead inside not to enjoy the humour this game throws at you.\n\n\n\nYou could argue that what you’re playing is a text adventure, given the sheer amount of written wordage on screen, but that feels unfair. There are plenty of graphics to chew on, and although they’re simple, there\'s a distinct charm to them that couldn’t be easily recreated by an amateur \'just\' drawing stick figures. They’re simple, but there’s been a lot of thought pumped into each design to give consistency and an intentional crudeness.\n\n\n\nYou may also feel you’re missing out on certain outcomes and possibilities when playing, and to put it bluntly, you are. Replayability is the order of the day, and to only play this through once is to only experience a fraction of the experience. There are \'moral\' choices, the previously mentioned classes, what could be classed as a hidden fourth class if you’re especially dedicated, a selection of companions to choose from, different horses to select, and a wealth of other small factors that tailor your experience each time. You can even indulge yourself in the somewhat-hidden Hard Mode, which forces you to wear a single hat for the entire duration of the game, and unsurprisingly, it makes everything harder. We foolishly did this on our first playthrough and we can attest that you really shouldn’t , because it\'s one hell of a challenge.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing is not your average RPG; in fact we’d go so far as to say you’ve probably never played anything quite like it in your life. Its combat won’t blow you away but don’t be lulled into believing that’s what this game is about, as really the whole thing is an adventure in exploration and interaction with a bit of fighting sprinkled in. It can occasionally be a little bit difficult to decipher, but the satisfaction felt upon working out a problem totally makes up for it. The humour is as wonderfully dry as the desert you’re traversing and the writing is some of the best you can find on the Switch. Unless you’ve not got a humorous bone in your body, this is one RPG you can’t risk skipping.\n\n\n\nExcellent\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nScoring Policy Review copy provided by Asymetric\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\nStats:\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nAlex Olney\n\n\n\nAlex is the man responsible for the daily videos you\'ll find on our YouTube channel.

Too many games that push themselves as being funny can wind up stretching the same tired quips to the point of annoying. Some have bad gameplay that you endure to get to the funny bits, and of course, there will be games that don’t click with your sense of humour. West of Loathing is an Adventure RPG. It’s also a very funny game that at the very least will have you smiling an awful lot.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing (WoL) is a world of stick figures and hand-drawn scenery. A lot of the look and feel draws from the browser-based MMORPG Kingdom of Loathing, of which this game is a spin-off. In fact, if you’re still on the fence about this game you can sign up and play Kingdom of Loathing for free and get some idea of the kind of world WoL exists in. In WoL it’s an interesting combination of point and click adventure games and turn-based RPGs. Play is divided between the map where you pick locations you have discovered and walking around the actual place on the map in a 3D space (although everything still manages to look like very flat scribbled out drawings). When exploring the locations, the game feels very much like the Paper Mario games or more recent South Park RPGs, while very much looking very different to other games.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning you get to choose one of three classes: Cow Puncher (Warrior), Bean Slinger (Wizard) and Snake Oiler (Rogue). They all have suitably silly abilities. The snake oiler whipping people with snakes when you’re not filling them full of lead, the Bean Slinger slinging beans and the Cow Puncher’s less silly punching. Ideally, you’ll want to pick the class that best suits your playstyle, but I never found any class to really be a struggle if you keep your levels up. Instead of levelling up and being given a bunch of points to upgrade your stats, you are given XP. If you have enough, you can sink it into any of your stats and skills. I enjoyed being able to choose what I wanted to spend it on but if that isn’t your thing you can let the game spend the points for you.\n\n\n\nStats can play a big part of what you can and cannot access as dialogue choices and actions you can perform, sometimes it just involves getting more XP and getting those stats up. Not everything will be available to you in one playthrough, as quests can play out differently depending on what options your stats allow. To experience everything KoL has to offer, you will need more than one playthrough. Some quests can have different approaches and outcomes, trying the different classes and several different NPC ‘Pardners’. There are several options for Pardners who will join you on your journey. Each have their own backstory, attacks and buffs, gaining their own XP through killing certain creatures connected to the backstory. You only take one Pardner with you, so if you want to get the most out of the dialogue you’ll be replaying a few times. If that sounds daunting, just playing it the once still provides you with a lot of content.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing isn’t a hard game overall. With minimal level grinding and good use of stat buffs, you can make a steady pace through the story, and there are lots to do on the side to help build up XP. I never found the combat too difficult, and it was usually a brief distraction away from progressing with a quest. Often being able to deal with obstacles by talking (or Hornswagglin’) your way through them as much as fighting someone. While you don’t have a posse alongside you to take on the wild west you do get to bring that ‘Pardner’ along with you (as mentioned earlier}. They’re an NPC who will accompany you on your journey, help in fights, and add a bit of extra dialogue and character into the game. Depending what Pardner you pick, they can also help make dealing with certain enemies a bit easier. For example, Doc Alice can kill any skeleton in one turn.\n\n\n\nUltimately, I found you can really make the combat as straightforward or difficult as you want. As a Snake Oiler, I could pull a snake out of my suitcase to fight for me while I drink potions to buff my stats, or I could just select the ability to fire three bullets at once and brute force my way through. If you do want a challenge some of the side content can provide that. There is also a way early in the game to unlock a hard setting by finding a suitable hat. The combat can also have its fair share of laughs, as it carries the same wordplay and ridiculousness that is throughout the rest of the game. The best part is that the battling works well with the rest of the game. If you do struggle with a fight and lose, there’s no real punishment. When you’re defeated you’ll be booted out of the battle and have gained an ‘anger’ buff, and you can either go do something else or try again. The worst that can happen is that you get too angry and pass out. This just returns you to your room and a slightly longer trip to returning to where you were.\n\n\n\nSo, I’ve mentioned a little bit that West of Loathing is a funny game. It’s hard to know what to pick out as an example, knowing any other review would discuss the more stand out moments. For starters, the dialogue is regularly good for a laugh. The game doesn’t take anything seriously, whether it’s silly puns, ridiculous enemies and attacks, and your interactions with anyone. There’s plenty of moments that stand out, whether it’s the narrator’s increasing disgust at you for sticking your hand into spittoons or playing through the whole game with the ‘walking stupid’ perk activated, causing your stick figure to regularly change walking animations from cartwheeling to doing ‘the worm’ dance move around the area (I left this perk on for the whole game). For fans of bureaucracy, there is a whole town dedicated to tedious tasks as you run around trying to file paperwork. This is funnier than it should be and frustrating as you’re reminded of tedious bureaucracy. There are side plots such as collecting ‘Nex-Mex’ books and finding the Necromancer or stopping an invasion of hellcows (cows from hell naturally) from returning to terrorise the world (again). There is more to WoL besides the comedy in it, I don’t want to downplay that, it’s just a fun game. Throughout the game, you’re regularly finding new locations to explore and at any one time, there are usually at least three different things you can tackle at your own pace.\n\n\n\nThe one knock I do have against the game is that there is so much content. If you don’t know what specific order you need to do things or have a certain item at a certain event, you can miss out on side content. You can go well over five hours without knowing some of these side things exist and the game still feels like you’ve gotten so much out of it. If you do want to get the most out of the game prepare to get a guide or wiki out when you start another run so you can see everything you missed the first time around, or I guess get it all right the first time.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing is one of the most fun and funniest Adventure/point and click game that I have played in some time. Combat rarely gets in the way of the adventure, and everything moves at a good pace to get you back to doing silly things that will keep you smiling through most of the games’ playing time. If you’re looking for a game with laughs that don’t lean too hard on using pop culture references or mean-spirited jokes at peoples’ expense, then West of Loathing is worth checking out.\n\n\n\nShare this story!\n\n\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\n- Lots to do - Funny as hell (regular hell, not the one the demon cows came from) - Fun to play\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\n- Easy to miss content\n\n\n\nOur Verdict\n\n\n\nOur Rating\n\n\n\nUser Rating\n\n\n\nRate Here\n\n\n\nOverall\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing is one of the most fun and funniest Adventure/point and click game that I have played in some time.

It’s an odd visual style in a world seemingly obsessed with high polygon counts and 4K fidelity. However, the choice here, both fits the game perfectly and should also be welcomed for its use, as it allows the superb writing to shine through. While the visuals are very simple, they still impress with the use of expression and shadows, making the world of the Wild West come to life. At times, the bold black and white imagery leaps from the screen as our hero wanders dungeons holding aloft a lantern which paints the walls with drastic contrasts of light and dark. It’s rather wonderful to look at for its simplicity.\n\n\n\nAway from the looks, the game delivers on every other aspect. The game takes place in the years of the Wild West and the protagonist, who you create and name, has decided to head out West. From the opening moments on the family homestead, you’re given the choice to play how you want. You might choose to be a hardnosed prospector who hates his small-town life, or you could be a young woman setting out to find her fortune, but will miss her family dearly. Because West of Loathing is an RPG in the traditional sense, you get to choose the rules of your life and how your character will react.\n\n\n\nAn example of this is a quest from a few hours into the game. I’d been tasked with helping the sheriff catch some bandits and began sneaking into their camp. The watchman who was posted to lookout had fallen asleep and I was given the option to tiptoe past him, wake him up and fight him, or kill him in his sleep. I went for the latter, which played out interestingly because not only did the game humorously triple check that I wanted to take the man’s life, but when I did, I was given a perk for being ruthless. Little decisions like this, which seemingly feel inserted for humour or for interest have actual consequences.\n\n\n\nThe developers seem to have thought of everything. Walking into cactuses repeatedly ends up giving you a perk of being covered in scabs, which boosts your armour stat. Combing your hair in the mirror adds moxie and reading books levels up fighting moves or skills. In fact, another interesting decision sees the narrator (the AI) auto level up your stats, but you can choose to do it yourself. This opens the game to those who might feel a little daunted by an RPG, with all those items and numbers.\n\n\n\nThankfully West of Loathing does its best to remain as simple as its look. The battles are turn-based and the left stick browses menus for items and attacks, while the right stick targets opponents. There are three character classes which reference traditional RPG tropes and all are easy to use in a scrap – the menu offers everything from attacking and shooting to first aid and special bullets which add debuffs to enemies. Along the way you’ll partner up and expand your party, which adds even more options. There are times when the fights seem overly easy, but I’m sure that depends on how thorough you are with side quests.\n\n\n\nQuests will do what they always do and provide new items, weapons and experience. So much of your cowboy/cowgirl can be modified for stats. Certain hats will adjust armour or spellcasting, holding a charm in your off-hand can increase attack or moxie. Everything from clothes to body organs can be tweaked through use of certain items, but this can be scaled back for a more streamlined experience.\n\n\n\nWhere West of Loathing really stands out, is in the writing. The team have gone to great lengths to provide bags of humour throughout. It might be in descriptors of items or lines of dialogue, it can also be from the narrator who constantly checks if you’re sure you want to search through a spittoon on the hunt for trinkets. The set pieces are always slapstick and reminiscent of Buster Keaton and Chaplin in their execution, even when you’re tasked with a devious puzzle, the jokes are never far away. To accent these, the plot will occasionally tug at your heartstrings, which the best comedy always does. Although the plot revolves around the idea of mad cows rampaging across the West, it doesn’t stop death from being affecting.\n\n\n\nWhile some of the quests can feel a little repetitive after a while – fetch quests can only entertain for so long – they’re usually accompanied by witty lines or puzzles based on environment. Playing through the game will trigger so many highlights; fixing a player piano, discussing the war with a crazy old man, protecting nuns from demons and seeking out the jail door for a useless sheriff. West of Loathing is a game you pick up for ten minutes and put down four hours later because you were lost in finding the right item or avenging the deaths of a family. Aside from a few tiny flaws here and these, this is a must own game for everyone and one that begs to be played over and again.\n\n\n\nVersion Tested: Nintendo Switch Review copy provided by Asymmetric\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\nAmazing\n\n\n\nGameplay - 9\n\n\n\nGraphics - 7\n\n\n\nSound - 8\n\n\n\nValue - 10\n\n\n\nWritten by\n\n\n\nDan Lipscombe\n\n\n\nDan has been writing about games for a decade and playing them for three times as long.

West of Loathing from Asymetric Productions is easily one of the best I’ve played ever, let alone this year.\n\n\n\nIts simplistic black and white palette and stick-men players (staples from the studio’s previous hit, Kingdom of Loathing ) belie a huge amount of charm, character and – thanks in no part to its fabulous writing, humour.\n\n\n\nIt’s a side-scrolling action role-playing game set, as you may have guessed, in the Wild West. After choosing a character and class (from three which will affect how you play) you set off to find your place in the world. The first town you’ll find is Boring Springs and your task will be to secure a steed. Boring Springs really serves as a tutorial, teaching you the basics; talking to various townsfolk opens up new quests and locations and you’ll hop to each one to further your adventure. At times you’ll be entered into battle with either random encounters (usually with demonic cows, skeletons or goblins) of other folks as part of your adventure. These battles are played out in a turn-based nature and initially are quite lacklustre. As you advance they become more tactical, if a little repetitive, which is the only real sore mark against the game.\n\n\n\nAfter sussing the mechanics and fulfilling your objective, you will be given a blank map and your real adventure begins in the town of Dirtwater, and you’ll also take on a partner too (although not taking one is NOT recommended) from a selection of those that you have helped out. Then it’ll be a case of exploring the terrain, taking on quests, discovering new locations and engaging in more battles to ensure that you reach the town of Frisco, upon which you adventure will end after a fun (if clichéd) climactic battle.\n\n\n\nIt’s not just all fast-travelling, random encounters and collecting quests though, many of the missions have puzzles, and require a reasonable amount of grey matter, if not trial and error. Later in the game, you’ll be afflicted with a nasty virus, and you’ll probably be backtracking to a quest you overlooked (I know I did!) in order to remove the blight upon your senses. There’s also a technological subplot running behind the scenes too, if you can piece it all together then you’ll have done better than me doing my review play.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing has a decent upgrade system running in the background, and all the XP you earn from quests and fights can be spent on upgrading in a variety of skills. You can enhance your muscle (strength for melee attacks), moxie (for enhancing shooting) or mystical (magic and stuff) abilities or even other things like grit or even perks you’ve learned. Safe-cracking, lock-picking and foraging will benefit you along the way. If you found and read the books for these, of course.\n\n\n\nThe presentation in West of Loathing is phenomenal as already noted, and the simple yet melodic soundtrack enhances the experience even further. Chirpy tunes in saloons, the tense tones during battles and even a delightful rendition of what sounds like “Cotten-eyed Joe” to lure out a villains’ hiding spot really hit home. This looks and feels like and hand-drawn western.\n\n\n\nI cannot recommend West of Loathing enough. Outside of the over-familiarity with the battles, there’s a deep, funny and compelling story and it’s well worth the money.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nThe amount of humour, fun and character within West of Loathing is astounding. Repetition in the turn based battles is the only slight in an otherwise amazing game. DLC is on the way too, and I for one cannot wait for it.\n\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nAsymetric Publications , West of Loathing\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n←\n\n\n\nHyper Sentinel Review\n\n\n\nStreet Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection Review\n\n\n\n→\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\nLooking for something?\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\nOur Nintendo Switch Magazine!\n\n\n\nRecent eShop Updates\n\n\n\neShop New Releases – June 14th, 2018\n\n\n\neShop New Releases – May 31st, 2018\n\n\n\neShop New Releases – May 24th, 2018\n\n\n\neShop New Releases – May 10th 2018\n\n\n\nRecent Reviews\n\n\n\nThe Inner World Review\n\n\n\nParanautical Activity Review\n\n\n\nPaladins Review\n\n\n\nAqua Moto Racing Utopia Review\n\n\n\nRoad to Ballhalla Review\n\n\n\nCrossing Souls Review\n\n\n\nSave the Ninja Clan Review\n\n\n\nFreedom Planet Review\n\n\n\nRecent Posts\n\n\n\nThe Inner World Review\n\n\n\nParanautical Activity Review\n\n\n\nPaladins Review\n\n\n\nAqua Moto Racing Utopia Review\n\n\n\nRoad to Ballhalla Review\n\n\n\nFind us on!\n\n\n\nMeta\n\n\n\nLog in\n\n\n\nEntries RSS\n\n\n\nComments RSS\n\n\n\nWordPress.org\n\n\n\nProudly powered by WordPress\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nTheme:\n\n\n\nFlyMag\n\n\n\nby Themeisle.', 'html\n\n\n\nBestGamingHeadset.com selects Logitech Gaming Headset G930 as best\n\n\n\nBestGamingHeadset.com\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nPrimary Menu\n\n\n\nSkip to content\n\n\n\nLogitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound\n\n\n\nAdvance Wars Guide\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\nLogitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound\n\n\n\nBestGamingHeadset.com is proud to award our award for the best gaming headset to the Logitech Gaming Headset G930. If you are a gamer who wants a wireless connection that does not lag, and that lasts for up to 10 hours between charges this is for you. It has state-of-the-art audio with Dolby 7.1 Headphone Surround Sound, and it is made to be lag free with 2.4 Ghz of power. While this all sounds great, and the manufacturer has a good track record of making quality electronic products, the reviews always tell the story of whether or not this product is a winner with gamers.\n\n\n\nA Word to the Wise for Those Who Wear Glasses\n\n\n\nSeveral reviews have lamented that if you have to wear glasses to be able to play your games, this headset is probably not for you. The earpads, which are made of a faux leather-like material, will make a squeaking noise as they rub against the frame of your glasses. While other Logitech models have cloth earpads that can be replaced, this unit does not.\n\n\n\nOther gamers were very happy with the units – for about a year. After that the headset would slowly start cutting out, until it got to the point of not charging at all.\n\n\n\nOther Reviews From Those Who Loved the Headset\n\n\n\nOther people who have used this brand of headset for a few years, are very happy with it. Almost everyone who has used this headset is amazed at the quality of the audio, with all spectrums, from lows to highs reproduced flawlessly and clearly.\n\n\n\nThere also seems to be a good deal of disagreement over the durability of this headset. Some people reported using them for years with absolutely no problem. Some people reported having to use duct tape to keep them together after as little as two weeks of use. Taking into account these wildly varying reviews, one can only surmise that those who had the most serious problems put the headset through much more use than those who had no problems. But once again, that is only speculation.\n\n\n\nOther Reviews and Observations\n\n\n\nMany people bought this headset for the express purpose of using it on Skype calls. Once again, while many people had nothing but good experiences with this headset, others endured the annoyance of being cut off for up to 8 seconds during a call. Other reviewers noted that before it disconnected, there was an annoying crackling sound that lasted for awhile.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\n\nWith so many conflicting reviews, it is hard to make a definitive call on this headset. Even those who gave the headset a positive review had some problems with connectivity and getting the headset sync’d with the rest of their equipment.

If your game is a heavy action game with themes of death and dread, a darker artstyle will fit. If you If you are trying to create a throwback platformer with classic elements inspire by games in the 80s, an 8-bit style works well. But what if your game is a cow tongue-in-cheek adventure game with satirical elements and incredibly silly situations? You bet your boots you can use stick figures as your aesthetic.\n\n\n\nCows aren’t going to punch themselves, you know.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing, developed by the team behind 2003’s Kingdom of Loathing, is a western RPG where you play as a stick figure traveling west to find the cause of the dead being arisen. As you expect, it’s not anything groundbreaking in narrative sense, but hot damn, this is one of the funniest games I’ve played in months.\n\n\n\nBlack and white and full of stick-figure-goodness\n\n\n\nTo give everyone a good example of West of Loathing’s humor, there is a settings menu with various options such as nerd mode (turns on descriptions for turn-based battles), the ability to turn on gridmode to see the exact placement of enemies, and colorblind mode… in a black and white video game.\n\n\n\nHumor isn’t the only charm this game brings to the ranch. After a lengthy prologue, you’re sent out west with your choice of one of three horses and one of three partners. This is where the adventure begins. With your trusty steed, you can explore the map to your leisure, choosing locations found by found by exploring, going on quests for townsfolk, or through random encounters. The map is split into different sections with a main town in each one. These towns contain the bulk of the quests and will often grow after these quests are completed.\n\n\n\nThey’re still sleep fighting to this day.\n\n\n\nQuests are usually going to one point and achieving a goal there such as talking to someone and receiving an item, in old adventure game fashion. However, some will have you overcome a puzzle, which are at times gave me a challenge I haven’t experience in an adventure game in a while. Unfortunately, there isn’t an easy way to see which quests you have active. You can ask your partner if there’s anything you’re forgetting, but having to cycle through the quests this way is hassle.\n\n\n\nSame. That’s how I end up writing reviews at 3AM.\n\n\n\nWhen you are able to tackle these quests, the game starts to shine. Most of the quests involve talking to someone, obtaining a MacGuffin, and returning said MacGuffin to the first person, but the dialogue involved is delightful. There was a case in the game where a quest forced me to run around a “ghost town” (a town made of ghost buildings and people) on a series of hi-jinx and bureaucracy. In order to build a bridge, I need a logging permit. In order to get that, I need to give it to town hall. In order to do that, I need it stapled by the stapler in town after the unstapler unstapled the terrible job the stapler did. Did I mention that only one person in this town is allowed to staple the papers?\n\n\n\nI hated everyone in this stupid ghost town. But, I loved every minute of that hate.\n\n\n\nThis crap went on for what felt like hours. And basically, if this were any other game, this would be a massive headache, but West of Loathing handles it incredibly well. I kept going because it was a rabbit hole of ridiculous rules in place and I wanted to know where it led, West of Loathing is full of these kinds of silly events, which surprisingly builds a lovable world full of idiots. Another event that can occur while you’re exploring the map is a combat event. These are usually optional, with the player given an option to run away or fight, but fighting is the best way to level up your skills, which are required to complete certain quests. And while the quests are fantastic, the combat makes the game feel too two-dimensional.\n\n\n\nI’m going to punch the hell out of this calf.\n\n\n\nThe combat system is a grid-styled turn-based system where players can either attack with a melee weapon or use their gun depending on what the enemy is weak to. This ends up becoming shallow, as there are few factors to change how much damage you put out and losing has very little consequences. If you lose a battle, you get angry. If you get angry 4 times, you pass out and end up in your bed on the next day. From what I’ve noticed, the only drawback is losing your food buffs that would have ended at the end of the day anyway.\n\n\n\nBusiness is booming, I see.\n\n\n\nDespite this short downside, West of Loathing is a fantastic game if you’re ever in the mood for heavy reading. The team at asymmetric have accomplished to build a large world with such a simple art style and hilarious sidequests.\n\n\n\n85\n\n\n\nGreat\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing\n\n\n\nSWITCH\n\n\n\nReview Guidelines\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing understands the stylistic charm that a unique aesthetic can provide and that stick figures are still, at the heart of everything, rad as heck. While the combat system is lacking, hilarious storytelling and a dynamic world make up a wonderful stroll through the western-styled landscapes.\n\n\n\n— Sean Anthony\n\n\n\nPROS\n\n\n\nHilarious dialogue\n\n\n\nPlenty of quests and sidequests, especially for its price of $11\n\n\n\nEach area has its own unique feeling to it\n\n\n\nCONS\n\n\n\nShallow combat system\n\n\n\nText-based storytelling sections are too heavy-handed at times\n\n\n\nSean Anthony both sells video games and writes about them.

It is set in the same universe as Kingdom of Loathing , a browser-based multiplayer RPG that was popular in the early 2000s. Like its predecessor, however, West of Loathing has a stick-figure art-style and tongue-in-cheek humor. None of it is meant to be taken seriously, and for a while, the style is quite enticing.\n\n\n\nYour goal is to find your way west. Although there is the main plotline, the majority of the game, if you choose to indulge it, is made up of a ton of side content. You’d be cutting yourself short if you just ran through the entire map, so the side content is something you’ll want to take your time with. In fact, the side content works in the same style as the main storyline and its gameplay is almost indistinguishable from the main game. Whether you’re fighting violent cows (yup) or finding odd items, the side content punches at the same weight as the main story.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the entire game just starts to grow old after not too long. The main reason for this is that the RPG mechanics are exceedingly simple. You control two characters, one of which is a partner you choose at the beginning of the game. There’s very little depth to the combat system. Most of the time I would just choose the hardest-hitting weapon in each battle. There’s not much in terms of character strengths and vulnerabilities. The strategy is virtually nonexistent. As a result, though new toys do make for entertaining battles when you first obtain them, most of the fights are just sequences you try to get through.\n\n\n\nMoreover, a lot of the battles are too easy or excessively difficult. The difficulty curve is not developed to be in tune with the character progression. I imagine this decision was made because the highlight of the game is its quirky and humorous dialogue, but it means that most of the actual RPG isn’t that great.\n\n\n\nHowever, the dialogue itself is rather good for most of West of Loathing . I frequently found myself chuckling or thinking: “wow, that was clever.” There’s an inherent sarcastic and skeptical nature to the story which makes it pretty humorous throughout. The developers also manage to cram in a ton of fictional content that juxtaposes with the otherwise historical setting. Seeing cognizant members of the walking dead roaming around the western setting is unexpected and humorous to behold.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing is a great value for its price and definitely entertaining for what it is. Unfortunately, the actual mechanics lack a lot of depth that keep it from being an experience for everyone. A deep RPG experience this is not. However, if you’re looking for a few hours to kill on a game with funny writing and creative environments, this one is for you.\n\n\n\nReview copy was provided by the publisher.

Is something like the Metroid Prime sub-series a first-person shooter or a first-person adventure? Where can the line be drawn between being able to soot things in first-person view and going on a big exploration of an environment? What to call a game to delves into even more different genres all at the same time? West of Loathing certainly appears to be one of those genre defying titles; however, this comes expectedly with the danger that it may try to do too much of everything to be good at anything, or to not be understood or appreciated because it spreads itself too thin. Cubed3 is thankfully there to check out how it all pans out in the end.\n\n\n\nA nameless hero, quickly named by the player at the start of the game, leaves his or her parents\' home in search of a career in the Wild West. Going from searching the disgustingly gooey depths of a spittoon at a saloon to hunting bounties... the player starts with next to nothing in hand and soon builds up an arsenal of equipment, meat (the game\'s currency), and friends through little quests as he or she explores the environment, ever moving more westward towards the North American West Coast. Along the way, a particular event of interest comes to the hero\'s knowledge, called ""The Cows Have Come Home."" Belligerent cows have indeed started raiding people\'s homes, wreaking havoc, and killing entire families in their path. This serves as the backdrop for West of Loathing \'s many events.\n\n\n\nFor all intents and purposes, this plays out as a cross between an adventure game and a text adventure, with turn-based, non-random battles thrown into the mix. The hero explores 2.5D side-scrolling environments and interacts with the scenery much like in an adventure game, with a level of interaction coming close to point-and-click titles, and with an amount of text for describing scenes and events that is close to text adventures of old. Interspersed in are turn-based battles that are mostly triggered by the events themselves or by the player\'s choices in dialogue trees. Battles, however, really do take a back-seat in the grand scheme of things and are not too prominent. Careful perusing of every area that unlocks over time quickly grants the player with the means to defend themselves and a ""pardner"" quickly joins, as well, to help out, among other things, with fighting off enemies.\n\n\n\nDifferent ""pardners"" have different effects, but one such example sees the hero or heroine accompanied by a gunslinger girl with a huge grudge against cows for wiping out her family, so she gets stronger as she carves notches in her rifle\'s butt, yet not from taking out any other types of enemies.\n\n\n\nThis game doesn\'t really follow any well established conventions when it comes to its battles and because they are not so prominent that the hero should spend a lot of time building up stats, it feels all the more refreshing for it. It\'s an ""anything goes"" kind of recipe that keeps taking the player by surprise along the way. Whenever the hero dies, for example, if he has acquired this ability, he may get the ""angry"" status that makes him super mad in the next battle so that he will not take as much damage and will deal more to the enemy, as well. Likewise, purposefully hitting cactuses repeatedly will unlock the permanent passive ability ""mostly scabs,"" which adds a permanent 5HP boost to the player\'s maximum HP pool. Other abilities are completely useless, such as ""silly walking,"" which simply makes the character\'s sprite walk in wide array of comical ways. Such abilities are only there for the fun of it but there are so many such seemingly useless things included that are just there to entertain that it instils a sense of expectation in the player, pushing him or her to press forward to see what other surprises are in store that will bring a smile or a fit of laughter.\n\n\n\nA lot of the humour, however, is conveyed through text descriptions more than through the visuals themselves. In fact, the simplistic graphics are only there to give a bare bones feel for what is around the hero, as well as to make interactions way easier than if this was just a plain text adventure. Still, the graphics themselves in all their simplicity can induce many a laugh, as well, such as seeing the hero walk around in a pope\'s mitre, shooting demonic clowns. All in all, then, while there is no well-defined goal from the get-go, this plays out as a quest to simply discover what awaits next, with new places and side-quests progressively unlocking along the way, some larger in scope, others that are quickly completed and don\'t affect the overarching plot at all.\n\n\n\nBeyond all this, of course, lies the RPG element of actually growing the player\'s strengths, of which he has many. Other than things like ""muscle"" (the hero\'s physical strength), mysticality, and moxie... there are more nonsensical things like grit, glamour, or even ""intimidatin\',"" which may open up new options to get out of certain situations through conversations. Upgrading all of these stats is done by manually spending XP earned in battles or by doing any number of random things, like searching drawers or fixing a messy stack of wooden logs. Regularly, there will be places or situations where the player will not be allowed to move forward without a high enough stat in a certain category so, in those cases, having XP stored can help unlock the way forward. If that is not the case, different locations in the game make it easy to fight weak enemies that make earning XP rather easy and, besides, stat requirements are usually not so high that grinding should become a huge necessity. After all, pieces of clothing found throughout the game may also help raise the player\'s stats. It is a very open-ended system where it isn\'t really possible to mess up or become completely stuck.\n\n\n\nFrom what appears to be a very simple looking title come a surprisingly deep adventure that doesn\'t take itself seriously at all and plays that card to its full extent without stopping at anything to surprise gamers. While things may look very simplistic and unrealistic, some effects like the hero\'s lantern in caves and mines shedding light at nearby rocks or mine carts and so on, casting long shadows across the scenery, do give an edgy vibe to the visuals, which means it is certainly not lacking in production values despite its artistic direction. The lack of voice acting actually isn\'t a big issue because character voices will play of their own accord in the back of players\' minds as they read through the hilarious dialogue. Music is mostly ambient and expectedly Wild West themed. It fits the atmosphere perfectly and enhances it like any good soundtrack should.\n\n\n\nThere is truly very little to complain about in West of Loathing . The amount of text may be off-putting to anyone who doesn\'t like reading too much in their videogames, so that\'s one thing. Lastly, the inventory system doesn\'t really make it easy to see what can be equipped or not, so with all the random stuff that the player may come across over the course of the adventure, some of it seemingly completely useless, equippable elements are not so easy to identify beyond browsing through dedicated sections. Other than these, West of Loathing only really suffers from a very strong personality that doesn\'t try to please everyone but goes all the way with its choice of topic and tone.\n\n\n\nCubed3 Rating\n\n\n\n8 /10\n\n\n\nGreat - Silver Award\n\n\n\nWhile this is obviously not Red Dead Redemption or anything of the sort, West of Loathing proves to be truly entertaining for what it is. The huge amount of text to read through to really appreciate the humour may be deterring to some of the audience, as much of the events and details are conveyed solely through the text on-screen, and the simplistic aesthetic may not do this game any favours to attract attention, but let nobody be fooled as this is indeed a truly awesome story to sit through.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing (Nintendo Switch)\n\n\n\nRate Game 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n\n\n\nGame Details\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\nScreens\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nDeveloper\n\n\n\nAsymmetric\n\n\n\nPublisher\n\n\n\nAsymmetric\n\n\n\nGenre\n\n\n\nTurn Based RPG\n\n\n\nPlayers\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nC3 Score\n\n\n\n8 /10\n\n\n\nReader Score\n\n\n\n0 (0 Votes)\n\n\n\nOut now Out now Out now Out now\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nThere are no replies to this review yet.

Its black and white color palette, stick-figure characters, and crude hand-drawn art might appear to be devoid of personality. But in practice, its visual simplicity acts as a malleable canvas for its imagination to run away with reckless abandon. West of Loathing is an involved Western adventure game/RPG hybrid that embraces absolute absurdity with mechanical flexibility and comedic personality, making role-playing in its monochromatic old West thoroughly entertaining.\n\n\n\nThe backbone of the game is its jokes and ingrained humor. Every little thing in West of Loathing serves as either a punchline or the lead-up to one. It exists in the writing naturally--the main narrative involves a bizarre cataclysmic event involving demon cows and rodeo clowns. The flavor text is filled with irony and wordplay, and conversations with characters play out like short sketches. The sheer amount of jokes draws you into Loathing\'s crudely drawn and ludicrous world, but what\'s more impressive is that they rarely fall flat, and if they do, there\'s often another to draw your attention away immediately.\n\n\n\nBut West of Loathing\'s consistent sense of humor runs deeper, woven throughout your interactions and the game\'s menus and UI. Attempting to search spittoons for items will engage you in long lectures from the narrator as they attempt to stop you from doing so by describing, in great detail, how disgusting what you\'re trying to stick your hand into is. Choosing to playfully boast that ""Sneaky"" is your middle name will discreetly change your middle name on your character screen to just that. Searching a shelf and finding a book entitled ""The Art of Silly Walking"" will unlock a new character perk, which adds a new toggle in the game\'s system menu to visibly change the way your character moves in-game to everything from cartwheels to swimming. These are just a few very early examples of the game\'s sense of humor, but West of Loathing\'s commitment and follow-through on its jokes will surprise and delight you throughout its entire duration.\n\n\n\nYou begin the game by selecting from one of three different classes--farcical takes on familiar RPG character tropes. The Cow Puncher is a warrior-style class, the Bean Slinger uses legumes as a source of magic, and the Snake Oiler is the rogue equivalent. But although each class comes with their own set of unique skills, and a convenient option for auto-leveling will build out a nicely rounded character for you of that archetype, West of Loathing also allows you the flexibility of manually assigning experience points to build whatever kind of character you want. That means there\'s nothing stopping you from having a physically adept Bean Slinger who can also pick locks, or a Cow Puncher with a high moxie stat and the cunning required to outfox his opponents.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing\'s combat consists of a simple turn-based system situated on a 3x6 grid. There are some small nuances to consider regarding positioning and using cover when facing opponents with ranged attacks, and a number of consumable items can be used in battle to cause various effects. But aside from the novelty of seeing the amusing enemy and ability designs in battle, combat is a straightforward affair.\n\n\n\nWhat\'s more interesting about West of Loathing\'s mechanics is that it is as much of an adventure game as it is an RPG, and one of the by-products of this is that there are multiple solutions to any given problem--and there is nearly always a completely viable alternative to engaging in battle. Having the right item in your inventory (some of which have multiple uses both in and out of combat), enough points in a particular statistic, or certain abilities unlocked means that you can complete quests or resolve random encounters without violence and still get enough experience points to spend on character progression. If you don\'t have the goods to pass these skill checks when you first encounter an obstacle, West of Loathing allows you to come back later with the right stuff if you so desire; it doesn\'t force you into any combat situations without warning, and it\'s a very welcome, player-friendly decision.\n\n\n\nThere are a few minor issues--inventory management on Switch becomes cumbersome as you collect an increasing amount of things, fights with a lot of enemies can obscure some pertinent information, and the stakes sometimes feel a little too low to be completely motivating. But West of Loathing\'s focus on maintaining a flexible, open-ended nature and lighthearted, humorous feel keeps you engaged in what feels like an imaginative pen-and-paper Dungeons and Dragons campaign, led by a game master whose only goal is to make sure you\'re laughing and having a fun time. West of Loathing\'s visuals are monochromatic, but there\'s enjoyable comedy painted between every line, a pitch-perfect Spaghetti Western soundtrack, and a full spectrum of role-playing possibilities to choose from that make it a consistently enjoyable madcap cowboy jaunt.\n\n\n\nUpvote (18)\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nView Comments (9)\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nPC & Nintendo Switch\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\nHumorous writing that rarely falters\n\n\n\nAmusing jokes that persist through the game\'s systems\n\n\n\nFlexible, non-lethal, and rewarding solutions to every obstacle\n\n\n\nPitch-perfect Western soundtrack\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nInventory management grows cumbersome on Switch\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nGreat\n\n\n\nAbout GameSpot\'s Reviews\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nEdmond Tran\n\n\n\nEdmond Tran played through West of Loathing as a Cow Puncher on PC and a Bean Slinger on Nintendo Switch.

A Wild West spin-off that retains its predecessor’s stick-figure style and heavy dose of humour, the game now makes its console debut on the Nintendo Switch. West of Loathing is a very worthwhile pick-up, providing a highly entertaining romp giving players plenty of reason to just sit back and enjoy some capering.\n\n\n\nPlayers start off by naming and selecting the gender of their character — stick-figures don’t lend themselves to much customisation after all — and choosing one of three character classes: Cow-Puncher (melee), Beanslinger (mage), and Snake Oiler (rogue). After a quick tutorial-style area where players unlock potential “Pardners” and horses with some quick quests, though only one of each is brought into the adventure proper, they soon travel to the frontier town of Dirtwater before heading further west, undertaking various quests or just generally exploring the locations as they go. Pardners act as a second party member, providing entertaining comments on the places visited and an additional way of providing new locations to explore, but not really impacting the overall adventure.\n\n\n\nThose familiar with Kingdom of Loathing will already be well aware, but it’s apparent from the outset that this isn’t a game to be taken seriously. The overall plot is basic; players are heading west just because it’s a thing to do. However, the game’s writing is fantastic throughout, injecting humour into every situation and doing it with aplomb. There’s lots of fun commentary or aspects to nearly every quest. West of Loathing does a great job of encouraging exploration; new locations and things to do pop up in abundance and the small nature of all the locations means that players never get bogged down in one area. Those that are longer than others, such as a ghostly bureaucracy, are very rare and the game simply uses the opportunity to insert further humour into things, and the writing is able to pull it off without adding annoyance. Asymmetric Publications’ ability to keep things funny without it feeling forced is a huge part of what makes the game enjoyable throughout.\n\n\n\nSpelunking comes with some pretty cool lighting effects.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing keeps players appreciably busy throughout its run. A standard playthrough that includes a decent chunk of the side content will likely take around eight to ten hours, but this still leaves out a lot of optional content. Even when the main task of heading all the way west is done, there are lots of things to do. There are many ending variations based on what players have — or indeed haven’t — done, and once it is reached the game happily continues and lets the final scene be activated at will, so working to achieve a better ending will be plenty motivation for many to find extra things to do. In fact, the two most world-affecting quest lines are completely optional.\n\n\n\nThough the game is generally great at giving players the freedom to do what they want, there is some difficulty in producing a character that will be able to do all of the desired side content, which is often gated behind attribute requirements in various forms. There aren’t traditional levels, instead players spend earned experience points on a multitude of upgrade options to skills or base attributes. Dealing with the UI for character upgrades, as well as items and equipment, can be an annoyance. West of Loathing freely-toggled option to automatically spend experience points, which provides a decently balanced character but will not be helpful if players are aiming for getting past specific roadblocks or upgrading particular skills. There are some cool trade-offs in character building that help give it a bit more depth, in addition to some crafting and equipment upgrade systems; certain books will provide new combat skills but in turn apply negative character perks, which is a neat touch. Pardners also have growth aspects but this is automatic and much more limited in how they grow; for example, Susie only gets more powerful when killing cows.\n\n\n\nCombat uses a standard turn-based system, with players and their Pardner facing off against up to nine, but usually between one and three, opponents. Players can generally either do a basic attack or use a skill or item. Item use and most healing skills are free actions, while attacking and buffing and debuffing skills will end the character’s turn. On the whole, combat is enjoyable but the balance often veers between a very easy victory or a certain loss. However, the balance issues are mitigated by battles being very quick and a loss simply dumping players back to the entrance of where they were, though a certain number of losses in a day will see players forced back to the town of Dirtwater for a rest. Pardners play an important role in battle, if mostly from a balance perspective, but really just act as a second, less versatile party member; a defeat occurs when the player character falls over regardless of if the Pardner is still standing, but not vice versa. The battle system is perfectly functional and complements the rest of the game well enough, but isn’t the main draw.\n\n\n\nNot the only way to deal with goblins, but one of the more satisfying.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing certainly isn’t in the business of challenging AAA games for graphical fidelity, but the animations are excellent and the game uses its minimalist art style to great effect through its design. The way shadows and light are handled in caves and mines also greatly enhances the feel of exploration. The world and narration have lots of character to them and the overall presentation is great, enhanced by some catchy music throughout. West of Loathing ’s control system works well and there were no issues with the Switch port in the review playthrough. The game feels right at home on the console, particularly on handheld mode.\n\n\n\nAsymmetric Publications has created a highly entertaining title in West of Loathing . The game provides an excellent mixture of humour and exploration that is very easy to get sucked into. Switch owners — and those on PC, Mac, or Linux who haven’t done so yet — would do well to check it out.\n\n\n\nScores\n\n\n\nBATTLE SYSTEM\n\n\n\n\uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf096 \uf096\n\n\n\nINTERACTION\n\n\n\n\uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf096\n\n\n\nORIGINALITY\n\n\n\n\uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf096\n\n\n\nSTORY\n\n\n\n\uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf096\n\n\n\nMUSIC & SOUND\n\n\n\n\uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf096\n\n\n\nVISUALS\n\n\n\n\uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf0c8 \uf096\n\n\n\nnsw\n\n\n\n< 20 HOURS\n\n\n\nEASY\n\n\n\nHumour by the spittoonful\n\n\n\nDoes a great job encouraging exploration\n\n\n\nGreat animations and music\n\n\n\nItem management and character progression can be awkward\n\n\n\nTactics rarely come into combat\n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\n\nAsymmetric Publications\n\n\n\nSwitch\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing\n\n\n\nAlex Fuller\n\n\n\nAlex joined RPGamer in 2011 as a Previewer before moving onto Reviews, News Director, and Managing Editor.

West of Loathing boldly tries to stick the landing, as this jokey stick-figure RPG adventure takes you through oodles of non sequiturs on a quest to go west. Essentially, it’s Skyrim through the lens of a joke book. While some elements of the gameplay might be a little too simple and goofy, the farcical satire wins out and West of Loathing is a deliriously silly romp.\n\n\n\nA tutorial area sets the stakes well and lets you customize your created character, which can be one of three classes: Cow Puncher, Snake Oiler, or Beanslinger. Your hero then aims to go west to make their fortune. A bunch of nonsense follows as you go through a slew of side-scrolling locales to earn meat currency, fight bandits, and solve puzzles. The main quest goes slowly west, but much like its loose Elder Scrolls inspiration, the magic is in the side quests. To go into too much detail of the content of these bizarre sojurns would ruin the shock and awe. Quests take so many left turns that you’ll wind up right back where you started ready to go in another cubic rotation.\n\n\n\nA wealth of the charm is born out of the dialogue and situations, from the travails of the many local Sherfs to the poker-like card game that has the most asinine rules (while still being logically consistent I think). It’s amusing wandering to different areas with your horse and partner, trying to find a path forward. New side quests and areas are found almost constantly, always giving you something amusing to do. It can be hard to sift through everything that needs to be done, even more so when your collection of items soars to an untenable amount of stuff. The best route through this game is to just roll with the nonsense and keep going. Worrying too much about 100% completion and full mastery exposes the more sour elements.\n\n\n\nThe most sour part is the turn-based combat, which probably feels that way since it’s one of the few semi-serious elements. It’s a lightweight and simplistic system, but it often slows the game down. I got to a point where I’d start avoiding battles unless absolutely necessary because it just wasn’t as fun as talking to people and doing tomfoolery elsewhere.\n\n\n\nEven if the combat is a little slow, the whole game looks weirdly beautiful with its stick-figure aesthetic. The lighting is great and the animation is smooth. The style is cohesive in a silly Western way, made even better by the old-timey soundtrack. An early discoverable Stupid Walking option might be the absolute best thing in a video game, though, as once found, you can turn on the ability for your hero to walk around in random, absurd ways. It was a surefire way to keep a grin on my face during the 5-10 hour campaign that is decently replayable because of the amount of customization and choice.\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing succeeds by making you giggly and happy while you play it. Treating this game like a super-serious RPG is the wrong way to go about it, as that’s where the holes start to emerge, whether it’s the middling combat or the mildly annoying quest and item management troubles. This is a comedy, pure and simple, and thankfully it’s one that’s clever and funny in a way that makes up for any lesser gameplay segments. It’s a great chaser between the ample supply of serious games out there, especially if you have Stupid Walking turned on.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\n\nExcellent animation and style\n\n\n\nGood writing makes it better than the sum of its gameplay\n\n\n\nLegitimately hilarious\n\n\n\nStupid Walking\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nCombat’s just okay\n\n\n\nQuest and item management is overwhelming\n\n\n\nTalkback\n\n\n\nAdd to the discussion!\n\n\n\nShare + Bookmark\n\n\n\nSwitch\n\n\n\nGame Profile\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nScreens\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\n\nArtwork\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nGenre\n\n\n\nAdventure\n\n\n\nDeveloper\n\n\n\nAsymmetric\n\n\n\nPlayers\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nWorldwide Releases\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing\n\n\n\nRelease\n\n\n\nMay 31, 2018\n\n\n\nPublisher\n\n\n\nAsymmetric\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\nWest of Loathing\n\n\n\n[Switch]\n\n\n\nGot a news tip?

up mushroom for . . . precise controls ; solid online experience ; clubs and miiverse integration ; more sports to come in the future , but what \' s here is engaging"", \'many ascribe part of wii’s success to nintendo’s clever decision to package a copy of wii sports with every console sold . the pack - in game delivered not just an engaging assortment of sports games to play , but was a showcase for the wii remote and the fun to be had with motion controls . with the launch of wii u , nintendo decided to go a similar route and highlight its new gamepad with nintendo land . unfortunately , nintendo land did little to draw in both old and new fans ; now , roughly a year after wii u’s launch , nintendo has come full circle and is offering wii sports club as a downloadable title . an hd overhaul of the original wii sports , wii sports club has also been outfitted with online multiplayer and a communities system , elevating what was an already great game to an even better one .\', \'the key to appreciating any wii sports title is realizing that the series doesn’t take itself too seriously . wii sports club is no different , as the two sports available at launch , bowling and tennis , are not pitch - perfect recreations of either . the play mechanics are basic ; physical movement ( walking , running ) is handled by the computer , while the player swings the wii remote for tennis and pulls back and thrusts the wii remote forward to bowl . as is typical with the series , wii sports club uses minimal button presses during gameplay , which makes the game accessible to multiple player skill types . wii sports club is like previous installments , in that there’s something about the lack of traditional button implementation that makes players feel like there are no barriers between them and the game , which is an excellent way to get non - traditional gamers in on the action . it doesn’t hurt that the controls are spot - on ; both tennis and bowling feel incredibly natural , and the physics are a fair facsimile of reality . don’t expect anything new from either sport , though , as these are the exact same versions of tennis and bowling from wii sports and wii sports resort , respectively . that might be a negative for some , but there are other additions that should appeal to those wanting something different this time around .\', \'the pricing model for wii sports club isn’t something i’m basing my score on , but i think it’s still worth mentioning . there are two ways to play the game ; 24 - hour day passes for $ 1 . 99 and unlimited club passes for $ 9 . 99 . when players first download the game , there is a free 24 - hour trial period in which to explore and play the sports to see if they’re worth buying . at any point during or after the trial , the player can choose which pass they want to buy to continue experiencing wii sports club . as nintendojo detailed last week , nintendo’s goal with this pricing model is to offer those who only play the game socially to opt out of committing to a full purchase . this is a convenient option that should satisfy anyone looking to play the game , whatever their circumstance might be . i will say that anyone looking to do a 24 - hour day pass might want to reconsider if they know they’ll be playing wii sports club more than five times in the future , but to each his own .\', \'wii sports club starts by asking the player to join a club . the options are all based on the fifty states here in the us , different countries around the world , or the more anonymous world club that doesn’t specify any geographic allegiance . the player’s club choice isn’t permanent , but switching can only be done once every 24 - hours . outside of personal preference , there’s no in - game advantage to be had from any particular one , so choose freely . nintendo has added a series of what are basically achievements that can be unlocked during gameplay in wii sports club . called stamps , there are quite a few to collect between both sports and can be viewed in the player’s stamp collection screen . beyond that , there is also miiverse integration , where players are encouraged to boost their club’s popularity by posting . overall , the club and miiverse inclusions are well handled , creating a sense of community along the lines of wii fit u , but not as extensive . it would have been nice to create personalized clubs in the way that players can make their own gym communities in wii fit u , but it’s a minor gripe that doesn’t take away from wii sports club .\', \'wii sports club has made improvements to the series’ formula , but it’s not perfect . the hd upscaling has been handled well , retaining the bubbly personality of the original wii sports games while also reinvigorating the presentation . still , it’s nothing that really showcases the raw power of wii u’s capabilities , and underwhelms compared to even wii sports resort ‘s visuals ; aside from a lower resolution , resort ‘s presentation is more impressive . part of the reason might be that there’s not a whole lot of activities in wii sports club outside of bowling and playing tennis . with only two sports available at launch , nintendo is taking things slowly with wii sports club , planning to release golf , boxing , and baseball at a later date . that doesn’t make the two sports currently available any less fun , but it does limit the experience .\', \'nintendo has finally brought online multiplayer to a wii sports game , and has done so with aplomb . finding matches is fast and simple , offering players the chance to go against friends , strangers , or members of their club . matchmaking is quick ; i hardly ever waited in a lobby to find someone to play against , and even when i did , it was very brief . nintendo wisely decided to allow players to practice whichever sport they’re playing while waiting , which is a lot funner than staring at a static loading screen . in my playtime , i’ve experienced very fluid matches overall , with minimal lag save for the occasional session here and there . as more players download the game and jump online , it’s unclear how nintendo’s servers will handle the demand , but so far they’ve done well .\', \'tennis offers either singles or doubles single - matches , with doubles allowing players to bring a second player along for the ride . bowling has a bit more variety with the option of playing spin control , 10 - pin , or 100 - pin games , but is single - player only . probably due to the all - ages nature of the title , nintendo has opted to not offer voice chat , but the d - pad can send three messages during gameplay that appear onscreen and are all notably friendly in tone . it’s a bit of a letdown for those who’d just like to talk without harassing anyone , especially considering how social an experience wii sports titles are known for being , but isn’t game - breaking .\', \'playing offline is fun as ever , providing the same suite of game modes as online but with the option for multiple players to join . the controls and gameplay are also equally smooth and precise playing offline . offline features a training mode for both sports if players want to get in a little practice with the controls or fine tune their techniques . if online included voice chat i might feel differently about this , but wii sports club is funnest with people actually in the room and enjoying one another’s company . on the other hand , there’s a unique sense of competitiveness to online play , so it’s perhaps fairer to say that both modes provide different but distinctly fun experiences .\', \'wii sports club is a fine addition to wii u’s library that pushes the series forward with the addition of solid online play . the core experience remains as compelling as ever , offering play control that is both satisfying and inviting to players of all skill levels . though the presentation has been upscaled to hd , it still feels like a step backwards compared to wii sports resort ‘s bright and fun visuals . with only two sports currently available , wii sports club isn’t as robust an experience as it could be , but what is there will still keep players entertained for hours . with the promise of additional sports in the future , there’s a lot of potential for wii sports club , and it’s easily worth a download for anyone who owns a wii u .\', \'this story is featured in . . .\', \'week : end game : on 11 . 23 . 2013 by nintendojo staff\', \'/ home2 / nindojo1 / public _ html / wp -

enabled and motionplus - enhanced versions of the five original wii sports games , wii sports club stands above its predecessor thanks to new and tweaked content .\', \'in a lot of ways , wii sports club feels like a remake of the original wii sports . i hesitate to call it an “hd remake” because it is filled with bad textures , boring backgrounds , and a noticeable lack of anti - aliasing . bowling , tennis , boxing , baseball , and golf return with all - new training minigames , the ability to play online , and , in some cases , new gamepad functionality . each sport also makes use of the now - standard wii motionplus , allowing for greater control . with a flick or twist of the wrist , you can get precise spin on your bowling ball or hook your golf ball into the blowing wind . even having played plenty of wii sports resort , which introduced motionplus , i’m impressed with how much better the original wii sports games play now .\', \'a few of the sports see marked improvements over their wii sports counterparts . baseball now features a more robust pitching and fielding mechanic thanks to the gamepad . using the second screen , you line up your throw with the batter’s box , choose a pitch , and then adjust the speed . if the batter hits a fly ball , you’ll need to move the gamepad around in real - space to line your glove up with the ball to make the out . while there’s still no ability to handle and throw grounders ( they are automatic outs , singles , doubles , or triples ) , having more control over fielding and pitching makes baseball more balanced and competitive .\', \'golf , on the other hand , moves closer to emulating the actual sport . placing the gamepad on the floor , the ball is shown as if it’s resting on a tee . with the direction the ball will travel and the power of the shot displayed there on the floor , i found that with just a few practice swings i became fairly accurate in my swings . combined with the ability to twist the remote mid - swing to hook the ball , golf winds up being a fun simulation that’s only lacking the weight of using an actual club ( and a mischievous gopher ) . this move toward more realism does dampen the ability to let newcomers easily jump in at a party , but regular visitors to the virtual links will be rewarded .\', \'unfortunately , there is no saving boxing . as with the original wii sports , these matches wind up feeling chaotic , unresponsive , and mundane . while using a motionplus wii remote in each hand does allow for better tracking as you block punches to either side of your head , throwing hooks and uppercuts often doesn’t register correctly . frustrated with the inability to play with finesse , matches often boiled down to throwing my arms around wildly and hoping for the best .\', \'besides boxing , each of wii sports club’s games are still a blast to play locally . online play , however , provides some very glaring issues . the slower - moving games , like bowling and golf , become an absolute bore thanks to a lack of in - game communication . with no voicechat , you’re resigned to using ( and often spamming ) a small handful of generic phrases like “soooo close” and “nice ! ” as you watch complete strangers bowl . with a rather generous time limit for each turn , a game of bowling with four players winds up feeling like an eternity .\', \'meanwhile , without faile , every game of golf i played featured someone who skipped the tutorial . the rest of our miis had to stand there , blank - faced , as the novice continually knocked the ball out of bounds on the very first hole until , mercifully , he was disqualified until the next one . to make matters worse , it is impossible to quit an online game in progress ; the only way to release yourself from the torment is to shut the wii u down completely .\', \'thankfully , these issues don’t extend to the action - focused tennis and baseball . tennis , in particular , became a favorite in my home . with online doubles matches , my wife and i cheered and yelled while performing backhand , forehand and overhand smash gestures to eliminate our random opponents . even playing without a co - op partner , tennis is a lot of fun and is easily the most rewarding of the five sports to play online .\', \'wii sports club mostly succeeds in refining the classic wii launch title thanks to smart use of the gamepad and wii motionplus . while the inclusion of online play creates some issues with the slower - moving sports , it’s still a fun addition for tennis and baseball . whether you want to play casually or competitively , wii sports club proves that the core wii sports experience wasn’t just lightning in a bottle .\', \'wii sports club improves on the classic wii game in nearly every way , proving that the concept isn’t just a gimmick .\', ""why it \' s insane that warner bros . doesn \' t have a superman anymore… but not surprising"", \'ahs : apocalypse kicked things off with . . . the end\', \'we encourage you to read our updated privacy policy and cookie policy .\']', '[\'death mark from experience inc . and aksys games launches on october 31\', \'death mark from experience inc . and aksys games launches on october 31\', \'you’ve all heard of wii sports by now . a genuine phenomenon in the world of games , one that you could play with your nan , even if the swinging of the tennis made her teeth fly out and land in the dog’s water bowl . it’s a known entity .\', \'the idea of releasing the more beloved sports as a wii u package , however , is an interesting one . there was always a heavy amount of confusion over the naming of nintendo’s latest superb platform , and re - releasing a game that made the wii so succesful might be asking for trouble . despite that , nintendo have made some tweaks to the content that make it worth considering .\', \'starting with baseball , the clear winner on the disc , the gamepad comes into play as it should . player one swings at the ball with the motionplus enabled wiimote , sure , but the catching player uses the gamepad to line up a circle and catch the ball . throwing a pitch is with the gamepad , too . you simply have to aim using the screen and press one of the corresponding face - buttons to choose which type of pitch you want to throw . it’s excellent and genuinely breathes new life into something i hadn’t played in years .\', \'bowling is identical , and so is tennis . both ask you to use the wiimote as a substitute , and while bowling still feels excellent , time hasn’t been kind to the tennis . frustrating and awkward , i just couldn’t get on with it at all . boxing is also pretty much the same as before , and still requires a couple of wiimotes in order to get the most out of it .\', \'and that’s where the biggest problem lies . to get the most out of wii sports club , you need a couple of motionplus - enabled wiimotes . it’s fair to assume most wii u owners will own some wii peripherals , but i’m not sure everyone will own two motionplus - enabled wiimotes , which is required to play competitive offline tennis .\', \'golf , however , remains excellent . in fact , it makes use of something nintendo showed when they unveiled the wii u . place the gamepad on the floor and you will see your golf ball , allowing you to use the wiimote to tee off . it’s the delivery of a promise , but it works well and adds immersion to a sport that was already represented incredibly well . it’s here that motion plus proves itself . whereas in the other sports it feels a little tacked on , the accuracy added to the golfing feels great .\', \'the biggest addition , of course , is the online multiplayer , which works well . this enlivens the tennis , and while each sport remains fairly shallow , it adds legs to the overall package . elsewhere there are training modes that let you practice your favourite sports , which is a nice touch . rounding off the package is miiverse integration , and the ability to join regional sports clubs to see who is the best at virtual sport . it’s another clever idea that proves this isn’t a lazy “hd” port , but it’s worth noting that it looks exactly as nice as you’d hope .\', \'verdict : it’s a bit of a shame nintendo didn’t see fit to mix wii sports and resort together for this package , as some of the resort activities are superior to the likes of boxing and tennis . furthermore , the smart gamer would do well to buy the sports they are interested in separately , as the digital downloadable version of wii sports club lets you do just that .\', \'but this is still a game that revels in a party environment . alone , there’s little to keep you coming back for too long , but after a few drinks , or with the family , wii sports continues to provide a good time . but please wear the straps when swinging the wiimote ; trust me , i’ve seen the damage first - hand .\', \'good . a game that scores 7 / 10 is worthy of note , but unworthy of fanfare . it does many things well , but only a few of them incredibly well and , despite a handful of good qualities , fresh ideas and solid mechanics , it fails to overwhelm .\', \'review code provided by publisher .\', ""editor -

looking characters that bested me in bowling were actually pro bowlers in disguise , but then again , maybe not .\', \'each of the five sports also comes with different training and gameplay options to help keep things interesting . there’s a whack - a - mole type minigame in the tennis training section , and a long distance target exercise in the golf section . my definite favorite has to be the 100 - pin bowling option , which makes the feeling of landing a strike so much more satisfying .\', \'you may have noticed i haven’t spent much time talking about the boxing . well , there’s a simple reason for that : i can’t stand it . maybe it’s just me , because the guys i played against online seemed to be doing fine , but the controls in boxing seem incredibly awkward and nonsensical . the movements are so far from 1 : 1 that it makes me wonder if they were even trying to match the motion . to me , the boxing is without a doubt the weakest of the five entries , which is sad because it was probably the one i was most excited about playing . as it is , i’d much prefer playing any of the other five sports than booting up the boxing one more time .\', \'which brings me to my final gripe about wii sports club : there’s just not enough variety . after all the many advancements in motion gaming that i’ve played since the first wii sports came out , playing these five sports can get old pretty quick . even wii sports resort had more going on than this . with all the canoeing , fencing and biking i did in that 2009 wii title , this game feels like a ghost town . by comparison , the massive library of games available in wii fit u will gives you much more bang for your buck .\', \'when wii sports first came out as a bundle with the wii console , it was more of an introduction or a showcase to motion gaming than a stand - alone game . sure , it was fun to go bowling with my dad , and it was amazing to actually play a tennis game without pushing buttons , but after the novelty of it all wore off i was left wanting more , eagerly awaiting the bright future that motion gaming would surely bring . i never imagined i’d be doing the same thing eight years later with better graphics and accessories .\', \'there are certainly marked improvements to this updated version of the original wii sports , but to be completely honest , after eight years and a new generation of consoles , i was hoping for something more . many would argue that the motion gaming revolution has already run its course , and that the ability to control a character by moving your hands has long since become a tired gimmick . rather than challenging this notion by reinventing the genre , nintendo missed the mark and basically reheated the same dish with some added garnish .\', \'rather than advancing upon the legacy of its predecessor , wii sports club comes off more like an hd remake of the same old game with some additional motion plus and gamepad support . while this may have been a groundbreaking package eight years ago , today it feels altogether lackluster .\', ""stefan started gaming the day his dad brought home a shiny , brand new commodore 64 . he \' s been hooked ever since . whether he \' s leveling up his ninja in final fantasy tactics , cruising the streets of san andreas or working on his terran build order , videogames are never far from his mind . he is currently on the lookout for an appropriate 12 step program to address his electronic addiction ."", \'spin -

in with the original wii was responsible for getting the console into millions of homes ( and breaking a few tvs ) , but it also signaled a significant change in player demographics that had been a long time coming . as the wii u struggles to gain the sort of consumer traction its predecessor had , nintendo has reissued the now - classic wii sports package , updated with a bevy of new bells and whistles . but while wii sports was forward - thinking in its ability to engage a different set of game players , wii sports club is a clunky attempt to bring the title up to the standards of current games .\', ""wii sports club features the five original sports from its predecessor : tennis , bowling , golf , baseball , and boxing . on a fundamental level , these play similarly to the original game , requiring the player to perform various motions to simulate the acts of swinging a racket , throwing a ball , or launching a punch . the wii motionplus ( or a wii remote with wii motionplus built - in ) is mandatory , and the additional range of gyroscopic control it provides adds a little bit more depth to these games : in tennis , for example , it \' s a lot easier to control the type of swings you get than it was with the original wii remote , leading to greater control of the ball . other games utilize the gamepad : in golf , you position the gamepad on the floor , where it depicts the ball ; you then swing the wii remote over the pad to hit the ball . baseball lets you use the gamepad \' s gyroscopic features to pitch and catch the ball , which is a clever and fun new addition to the formula . for the most part , however , wii sports club is all about that time - tested wii remote waggling ."", \'there are no words for that mustache .\', ""besides the main games , wii sports club also features mini - games that put twists on the various sports , like launching a tennis ball to hit whack - a - mole targets , trying to bowl down unusual 100 - pin patterns , and playing bingo by launching golf balls onto a grid . these games can be played solo or with friends ( though not online ) , and make for a nice distraction if you get bored of the standard sports . these games are all quite short , however , so don \' t expect to be enthralled by them for very long ."", \'one of the selling points of wii sports club is its online features , and unfortunately , it \\\' s here where the collection falters the hardest . when you start the game , you \\\' re asked to join a regional "" club "" of your personal choosing . this isn \\\' t restricted by physical geography ; i live in california , but i joined the iowa club because i grew up in that state . you \\\' re supposed to socialize with other members of your club , forming friendships and rivalries with other territory clubs , but such socialization is uncommon because the online experience is simply not good at all .\', ""for starters , online play is restricted to very basic rules for each sport , with only bowling featuring any sort of significant rule variations to choose from . finding opponents is also a challenge . i \' d log on during prime time in the evenings , weekends and weekdays , pick my sport of choice , and be sent to a practice room where i \' d wait for an opponent for a few minutes before being told the game couldn \' t find anyone and i would be booted back to the menu . i had the most luck finding people to play tennis , but trying to find a person to play 100 - pin bowling was like pulling teeth . looking at the game \' s miiverse , i saw plenty of folks discussing their online games with others , so why wasn \' t i getting any sporting funtimes ?"", ""it has much to do with the game \' s netcode . wii sports club has serious , pervasive problems with lag and stuttering during games . players in the miiverse universally reported the same issues , making online play a bust . but beyond the online , how is wii sports club at recapturing the magic of the original wii sports and getting non - typical players engaged in the game ? i invited a few people i knew who aren \' t frequent game - players to partake in some virtual sporting with me . while they all seemed to enjoy the games - - especially the new mini - games - - the gamepad options proved troublesome . ( there was a lot of worry about people and pets accidentally stepping on the controller during golf in particular . ) there \' s simply no substantial improvement here - - nothing to make the re - release a valuable upgrade over the original ."", \'the greens are always greener on the other side .\', \'on top of everything is a rather confusing pricing structure : you can obtain the game as either a free download or in a retail package , but the downloadable version only lets you play for a limited time before you have to purchase a $ 1 . 99 24 - hour "" day pass "" or unlimited access to individual sports for $ 9 . 99 each . the package version doesn \\\' t have any such restrictions , save for the minor inconvenience of having to take the disc in and out of the console , so why not offer a simple , full - access download version as well ?\', ""wii sports club is emblematic of nintendo \' s strange and silly approach to online games and distribution , given its unintuitive interface for finding sports partners , the consistently poor connection quality , and a pricing strategy that makes little sense . it works a lot better as a local game , but even then , it \' s not a massive improvement over the original title as a pick -

released wii sports clubs , which is essentially an hd remake of the original wii sports for the wii u . it doesn \\\' t amount to much more than an eight - year - old tech demo , but i had more fun than i expected revisiting boxing , baseball , bowling , tennis , and golf , most of which have been enhanced in some way for the wii u .\', \'bowling , of course , is still the king . though it hasn \\\' t been enhanced in any really discernible way outside of supporting online play , it still feels the most natural and well - realized out of the games on offer . it even goes so far as to make it possible to put spin on the ball , though it \\\' s done mechanically in - game rather than with the wii remote . along with golf , which now supports the wii u gamepad as a way to position the club , bowling definitely feels the most "" real "" of the wii u collection .\', \'on the opposite side of the spectrum is boxing , which is every bit as clunky as it was on the wii , even with the addition of wii motionplus support . every punch goes out with a slow , piston - like thud , making them easy to block or otherwise avoid . tennis , meanwhile , is fun for a few minutes , but it quickly becomes apparent how difficult it is to aim the ball . baseball is noticeably improved thanks to the introduction of the wii u gamepad as a second screen that can be used to track and catch flyballs , but like most baseball games , it suffers from repetitive mechanics .\', \'all told , not much has changed in terms of actual gameplay from the days of the wii , even with wii motionplus support . some of the sports are stronger than others , but they are all pretty shallow , making them little more than basic party games . their strength back in 2006 was in their novelty and their promise for the future . i enjoyed wii sports , but i saw them as more of a proof - of - concept for motion controls than anything . i always figured that 2k or ea would come in and use wii sports as the basis of a serious sports sim . and to their credit , they did try . but in the end , the millions of middle - aged moms and dads who made the wii a mega - success preferred carnival games and dancing with the stars , and the trickle of serious - minded sports games dried up .\', \'the gamepad gets a workout in wii sports club .\', \'that \\\' s not to say that wii sports is totally without merit . i \\\' m surprised how well golf and bowling in particular have held up over the years , and all of the games remain easy to pick up and play . nintendo has also done a good job of adding value to the package with sophisticated stat tracking and online play . insane as it is to think of people logging in to bowl online , they do exist . the other night , i bowled a rousing game with a mutton - chopped mii by the name of "" texas , "" who serenaded me with a "" howdy "" every time he got a strike . it \\\' s difficult to imagine the wii sports online community having any legs , but it \\\' s a fun alternative if you don \\\' t have any friends in - house willing to play a round of golf .\', ""as for the stat tracking , i \' ll admit to being impressed by the rankings that nintendo provides . wii sports takes a page from the fifa series by encouraging players to join a club based on their location , then ranks each club by its win - loss percentage . picking the minnesota club also meant that i could opt to be matched up with people in my home state as well as see contextual miiverse posts praising my successes and mocking my failures . as social integration goes , the wii sports clubs are surprisingly modern , and go well beyond anything available in madden nfl . it \' s a feature that sort of makes me sad that ea has completely abandoned the wii u . i would love for tiburon to take a few notes from nintendo ."", ""for all that though , wii sports still isn \' t much more than a curiosity . its commendable that nintendo has used this opportunity to add gamepad functionality , online support , and miiverse integration , but there \' s no hiding the fact that they \' re dressing up what was once a free pack -

Precise controls; solid online experience; clubs and Miiverse integration; more sports to come in the future, but what\'s here is engaging\n\n\n\nPoison Mushroom for... No online chat; presentation is bland compared to Wii Sports Resort\n\n\n\nMany ascribe part of Wii’s success to Nintendo’s clever decision to package a copy of Wii Sports with every console sold. The pack-in game delivered not just an engaging assortment of sports games to play, but was a showcase for the Wii Remote and the fun to be had with motion controls. With the launch of Wii U, Nintendo decided to go a similar route and highlight its new GamePad with Nintendo Land . Unfortunately, Nintendo Land did little to draw in both old and new fans; now, roughly a year after Wii U’s launch, Nintendo has come full circle and is offering Wii Sports Club as a downloadable title. An HD overhaul of the original Wii Sports , Wii Sports Club has also been outfitted with online multiplayer and a communities system, elevating what was an already great game to an even better one.\n\n\n\nThe key to appreciating any Wii Sports title is realizing that the series doesn’t take itself too seriously. Wii Sports Club is no different, as the two sports available at launch, bowling and tennis, are not pitch-perfect recreations of either. The play mechanics are basic; physical movement (walking, running) is handled by the computer, while the player swings the Wii Remote for tennis and pulls back and thrusts the Wii Remote forward to bowl. As is typical with the series, Wii Sports Club uses minimal button presses during gameplay, which makes the game accessible to multiple player skill types. Wii Sports Club is like previous installments, in that there’s something about the lack of traditional button implementation that makes players feel like there are no barriers between them and the game, which is an excellent way to get non-traditional gamers in on the action. It doesn’t hurt that the controls are spot-on; both tennis and bowling feel incredibly natural, and the physics are a fair facsimile of reality. Don’t expect anything new from either sport, though, as these are the exact same versions of tennis and bowling from Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort , respectively. That might be a negative for some, but there are other additions that should appeal to those wanting something different this time around.\n\n\n\nThe pricing model for Wii Sports Club isn’t something I’m basing my score on, but I think it’s still worth mentioning. There are two ways to play the game; 24-hour Day Passes for $1.99 and unlimited Club Passes for $9.99. When players first download the game, there is a free 24-hour trial period in which to explore and play the sports to see if they’re worth buying. At any point during or after the trial, the player can choose which pass they want to buy to continue experiencing Wii Sports Club . As Nintendojo detailed last week , Nintendo’s goal with this pricing model is to offer those who only play the game socially to opt out of committing to a full purchase. This is a convenient option that should satisfy anyone looking to play the game, whatever their circumstance might be. I will say that anyone looking to do a 24-hour Day Pass might want to reconsider if they know they’ll be playing Wii Sports Club more than five times in the future, but to each his own.\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club starts by asking the player to join a club. The options are all based on the fifty states here in the US, different countries around the world, or the more anonymous world club that doesn’t specify any geographic allegiance. The player’s club choice isn’t permanent, but switching can only be done once every 24-hours. Outside of personal preference, there’s no in-game advantage to be had from any particular one, so choose freely. Nintendo has added a series of what are basically achievements that can be unlocked during gameplay in Wii Sports Club . Called stamps, there are quite a few to collect between both sports and can be viewed in the player’s Stamp Collection screen. Beyond that, there is also Miiverse integration, where players are encouraged to boost their club’s popularity by posting. Overall, the club and Miiverse inclusions are well handled, creating a sense of community along the lines of Wii Fit U , but not as extensive. It would have been nice to create personalized clubs in the way that players can make their own gym communities in Wii Fit U , but it’s a minor gripe that doesn’t take away from Wii Sports Club .\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club has made improvements to the series’ formula, but it’s not perfect. The HD upscaling has been handled well, retaining the bubbly personality of the original Wii Sports games while also reinvigorating the presentation. Still, it’s nothing that really showcases the raw power of Wii U’s capabilities, and underwhelms compared to even Wii Sports Resort ‘s visuals; aside from a lower resolution, Resort ‘s presentation is more impressive. Part of the reason might be that there’s not a whole lot of activities in Wii Sports Club outside of bowling and playing tennis. With only two sports available at launch, Nintendo is taking things slowly with Wii Sports Club , planning to release golf, boxing, and baseball at a later date. That doesn’t make the two sports currently available any less fun, but it does limit the experience.\n\n\n\nNintendo has finally brought online multiplayer to a Wii Sports game, and has done so with aplomb. Finding matches is fast and simple, offering players the chance to go against friends, strangers, or members of their club. Matchmaking is quick; I hardly ever waited in a lobby to find someone to play against, and even when I did, it was very brief. Nintendo wisely decided to allow players to practice whichever sport they’re playing while waiting, which is a lot funner than staring at a static loading screen. In my playtime, I’ve experienced very fluid matches overall, with minimal lag save for the occasional session here and there. As more players download the game and jump online, it’s unclear how Nintendo’s servers will handle the demand, but so far they’ve done well.\n\n\n\nTennis offers either singles or doubles single-matches, with doubles allowing players to bring a second player along for the ride. Bowling has a bit more variety with the option of playing spin control, 10-pin, or 100-pin games, but is single-player only. Probably due to the all-ages nature of the title, Nintendo has opted to not offer voice chat, but the d-pad can send three messages during gameplay that appear onscreen and are all notably friendly in tone. It’s a bit of a letdown for those who’d just like to talk without harassing anyone, especially considering how social an experience Wii Sports titles are known for being, but isn’t game-breaking.\n\n\n\nPlaying offline is fun as ever, providing the same suite of game modes as online but with the option for multiple players to join. The controls and gameplay are also equally smooth and precise playing offline. Offline features a training mode for both sports if players want to get in a little practice with the controls or fine tune their techniques. If online included voice chat I might feel differently about this, but Wii Sports Club is funnest with people actually in the room and enjoying one another’s company. On the other hand, there’s a unique sense of competitiveness to online play, so it’s perhaps fairer to say that both modes provide different but distinctly fun experiences.\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club is a fine addition to Wii U’s library that pushes the series forward with the addition of solid online play. The core experience remains as compelling as ever, offering play control that is both satisfying and inviting to players of all skill levels. Though the presentation has been upscaled to HD, it still feels like a step backwards compared to Wii Sports Resort ‘s bright and fun visuals. With only two sports currently available, Wii Sports Club isn’t as robust an experience as it could be, but what is there will still keep players entertained for hours. With the promise of additional sports in the future, there’s a lot of potential for Wii Sports Club , and it’s easily worth a download for anyone who owns a Wii U.\n\n\n\nThis story is featured in...\n\n\n\nIssue 180\n\n\n\nWeek: End Game: On 11.23.2013 by Nintendojo Staff\n\n\n\nPokémon X and Y Are The Fastest Selling 3DS Titles Ever by Marc Deschamps\n\n\n\nThe Waiting Blade by Robert Marrujo\n\n\n\nNew Disney Infinity Figures Released Today by Marc Deschamps\n\n\n\nReggie Guarantees Major Wii U Releases Will Be Best Sellers This Generation by Marc Deschamps\n\n\n\nReview: Call of Duty: Ghosts by Sam Stewart\n\n\n\nReview: Rune Factory IV by Andrew Hsieh\n\n\n\nWii U Mario Mega Bundle Coming to the UK by Sam Stewart\n\n\n\nBuy a New 3DS in Europe, Get a Free Copy of Super Mario 3D Land by Sam Stewart\n\n\n\nNintendo Download: 11.21.2013 by Sam Stewart\n\n\n\nRetro Scope: The Legend of Zelda: Link\'s Awakening by Jason Strong\n\n\n\nReview: Ohno Odyssey by Anthony Vigna\n\n\n\nNew Fossil Fighters Game Coming to 3DS in 2014 by Kyle England\n\n\n\nX Marks the Spot by Anthony Vigna\n\n\n\nJapanese Man Arrested for Threatening Nintendo Executives by Kyle England\n\n\n\nA Link Between Worlds Was Shot Down by Miyamoto at First by Kyle England\n\n\n\nReview: Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate by Robert Marrujo\n\n\n\nReview: Batman: Arkham Origins by Robert Marrujo\n\n\n\nAtlus Confirms Conception 2: Children of the Stars for 3DS by Anthony Vigna\n\n\n\nTop Ten: Platforming Game Mechanics by Sam Stewart\n\n\n\nHappy Birthday to Three Nintendo Consoles by Anthony Vigna\n\n\n\nNew Wii U System Update Live Now by Anthony Vigna\n\n\n\nReview: Gabrielle\'s Ghostly Groove 3D by Katharine Byrne\n\n\n\nImpressions: Wii Mini by Robert Marrujo\n\n\n\nPier Solar HD Delayed to 2014 by Kevin Knezevic\n\n\n\nThoughts: Pokémon Origins: Episode 1 by Robert Marrujo\n\n\n\nBravely Default Flying Fairyless in Europe by Kevin Knezevic\n\n\n\nTrack of the Week: Inside the Castle Walls ( Super Mario 64 ) by Kevin Knezevic\n\n\n\nOne Response to “Review: Wii Sports Club ”\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n: mysql_query(): Access denied for user \'root\'@\'localhost\' (using password: NO) in\n\n\n\n/home2/nindojo1/public_html/wp-content/plugins/comment-rating/comment-rating.php\n\n\n\non line\n\n\n\n219\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n: mysql_query(): A link to the server could not be established in\n\n\n\n/home2/nindojo1/public_html/wp-content/plugins/comment-rating/comment-rating.php\n\n\n\non line\n\n\n\n219\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n: mysql_query(): Access denied for user \'root\'@\'localhost\' (using password: NO) in\n\n\n\n/home2/nindojo1/public_html/wp-content/plugins/comment-rating/comment-rating.php\n\n\n\non line\n\n\n\n226\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n: mysql_query(): A link to the server could not be established in\n\n\n\n/home2/nindojo1/public_html/wp-content/plugins/comment-rating/comment-rating.php\n\n\n\non line\n\n\n\n226\n\n\n\nclass=""comment byuser comment-author-benkadamusgmail-com even thread-even depth-1"" id=""li-comment-17961"">\n\n\n\nbenjo\n\n\n\nsays...\n\n\n\nI totally get that this game is just a re-hash of the most popular Wii Sports modes, but it’s also a brilliant update.

Featuring online-enabled and MotionPlus-enhanced versions of the five original Wii Sports games, Wii Sports Club stands above its predecessor thanks to new and tweaked content.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nIn a lot of ways, Wii Sports Club feels like a remake of the original Wii Sports. I hesitate to call it an “HD remake” because it is filled with bad textures, boring backgrounds, and a noticeable lack of anti-aliasing. Bowling, Tennis, Boxing, Baseball, and Golf return with all-new training minigames, the ability to play online, and, in some cases, new GamePad functionality. Each sport also makes use of the now-standard Wii MotionPlus, allowing for greater control. With a flick or twist of the wrist, you can get precise spin on your bowling ball or hook your golf ball into the blowing wind. Even having played plenty of Wii Sports Resort, which introduced MotionPlus, I’m impressed with how much better the original Wii Sports games play now.\n\n\n\nA few of the sports see marked improvements over their Wii Sports counterparts. Baseball now features a more robust pitching and fielding mechanic thanks to the GamePad. Using the second screen, you line up your throw with the batter’s box, choose a pitch, and then adjust the speed. If the batter hits a fly ball, you’ll need to move the GamePad around in real-space to line your glove up with the ball to make the out. While there’s still no ability to handle and throw grounders (they are automatic outs, singles, doubles, or triples), having more control over fielding and pitching makes Baseball more balanced and competitive.\n\n\n\nGolf, on the other hand, moves closer to emulating the actual sport. Placing the GamePad on the floor, the ball is shown as if it’s resting on a tee. With the direction the ball will travel and the power of the shot displayed there on the floor, I found that with just a few practice swings I became fairly accurate in my swings. Combined with the ability to twist the remote mid-swing to hook the ball, Golf winds up being a fun simulation that’s only lacking the weight of using an actual club (and a mischievous gopher). This move toward more realism does dampen the ability to let newcomers easily jump in at a party, but regular visitors to the virtual links will be rewarded.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is no saving Boxing. As with the original Wii Sports, these matches wind up feeling chaotic, unresponsive, and mundane. While using a MotionPlus Wii Remote in each hand does allow for better tracking as you block punches to either side of your head, throwing hooks and uppercuts often doesn’t register correctly. Frustrated with the inability to play with finesse, matches often boiled down to throwing my arms around wildly and hoping for the best.\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club\n\n\n\n10+ IMAGES\n\n\n\nFullscreen Image\n\n\n\nArtboard 3 Copy\n\n\n\nArtboard 3\n\n\n\nESC\n\n\n\n01\n\n\n\nOF 23\n\n\n\n01\n\n\n\nOF 23\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club\n\n\n\nDownload Image\n\n\n\nCaptions\n\n\n\nESC\n\n\n\nBesides Boxing, each of Wii Sports Club’s games are still a blast to play locally. Online play, however, provides some very glaring issues. The slower-moving games, like Bowling and Golf, become an absolute bore thanks to a lack of in-game communication. With no voicechat, you’re resigned to using (and often spamming) a small handful of generic phrases like “soooo close” and “nice!” as you watch complete strangers bowl. With a rather generous time limit for each turn, a game of bowling with four players winds up feeling like an eternity.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, without faile, every game of Golf I played featured someone who skipped the tutorial. The rest of our Miis had to stand there, blank-faced, as the novice continually knocked the ball out of bounds on the very first hole until, mercifully, he was disqualified until the next one. To make matters worse, it is impossible to quit an online game in progress; the only way to release yourself from the torment is to shut the Wii U down completely.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nThankfully, these issues don’t extend to the action-focused Tennis and Baseball. Tennis, in particular, became a favorite in my home. With online doubles matches, my wife and I cheered and yelled while performing backhand, forehand and overhand smash gestures to eliminate our random opponents. Even playing without a co-op partner, Tennis is a lot of fun and is easily the most rewarding of the five sports to play online.\n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club mostly succeeds in refining the classic Wii launch title thanks to smart use of the GamePad and Wii MotionPlus. While the inclusion of online play creates some issues with the slower-moving sports, it’s still a fun addition for Tennis and Baseball. Whether you want to play casually or competitively, Wii Sports Club proves that the core Wii Sports experience wasn’t just lightning in a bottle.\n\n\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club\n\n\n\nReleases July 25, 2014\n\n\n\nGreat\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club improves on the classic Wii game in nearly every way, proving that the concept isn’t just a gimmick.\n\n\n\n8 Aug 2014\n\n\n\nGreat use of MotionPlus/GamePad\n\n\n\nGolf and Baseball\n\n\n\nOnline Tennis\n\n\n\nBowling and Golf online\n\n\n\nBoxing is still terrible\n\n\n\n8.0\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nRead our review standards\n\n\n\nBuying Guide\n\n\n\nPowered by IGN Deals\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\nWhy It's Insane That Warner Bros.

A genuine phenomenon in the world of games, one that you could play with your Nan, even if the swinging of the Tennis made her teeth fly out and land in the dog’s water bowl. It’s a known entity.\n\n\n\nThe idea of releasing the more beloved sports as a Wii U package, however, is an interesting one. There was always a heavy amount of confusion over the naming of Nintendo’s latest superb platform, and re-releasing a game that made the Wii so succesful might be asking for trouble. Despite that, Nintendo have made some tweaks to the content that make it worth considering.\n\n\n\nStarting with Baseball, the clear winner on the disc, the GamePad comes into play as it should. Player one swings at the ball with the MotionPlus enabled Wiimote, sure, but the catching player uses the GamePad to line up a circle and catch the ball. Throwing a pitch is with the GamePad, too. You simply have to aim using the screen and press one of the corresponding face-buttons to choose which type of pitch you want to throw. It’s excellent and genuinely breathes new life into something I hadn’t played in years.\n\n\n\nBowling is identical, and so is Tennis. Both ask you to use the Wiimote as a substitute, and while bowling still feels excellent, time hasn’t been kind to the Tennis. Frustrating and awkward, I just couldn’t get on with it at all. Boxing is also pretty much the same as before, and still requires a couple of Wiimotes in order to get the most out of it.\n\n\n\nAnd that’s where the biggest problem lies. To get the most out of Wii Sports Club, you need a couple of MotionPlus-enabled Wiimotes. It’s fair to assume most Wii U owners will own some Wii peripherals, but I’m not sure everyone will own two MotionPlus-enabled Wiimotes, which is required to play competitive offline Tennis.\n\n\n\nGolf, however, remains excellent. In fact, it makes use of something Nintendo showed when they unveiled the Wii U. Place the GamePad on the floor and you will see your golf ball, allowing you to use the Wiimote to tee off. It’s the delivery of a promise, but it works well and adds immersion to a sport that was already represented incredibly well. It’s here that motion plus proves itself. Whereas in the other sports it feels a little tacked on, the accuracy added to the golfing feels great.\n\n\n\nThe biggest addition, of course, is the online multiplayer, which works well. This enlivens the Tennis, and while each sport remains fairly shallow, it adds legs to the overall package. Elsewhere there are training modes that let you practice your favourite sports, which is a nice touch. Rounding off the package is Miiverse integration, and the ability to join regional sports clubs to see who is the best at virtual sport. It’s another clever idea that proves this isn’t a lazy “HD” port, but it’s worth noting that it looks exactly as nice as you’d hope.\n\n\n\nVERDICT: It’s a bit of a shame Nintendo didn’t see fit to mix Wii Sports and Resort together for this package, as some of the Resort activities are superior to the likes of Boxing and Tennis. Furthermore, the smart gamer would do well to buy the sports they are interested in separately, as the digital downloadable version of Wii Sports Club lets you do just that.\n\n\n\nBut this is still a game that revels in a party environment. Alone, there’s little to keep you coming back for too long, but after a few drinks, or with the family, Wii Sports continues to provide a good time. But please wear the straps when swinging the Wiimote; trust me, I’ve seen the damage first-hand.\n\n\n\nGOOD. A game that scores 7/10 is worthy of note, but unworthy of fanfare. It does many things well, but only a few of them incredibly well and, despite a handful of good qualities, fresh ideas and solid mechanics, it fails to overwhelm.\n\n\n\nOur Scoring Policy\n\n\n\nReview code provided by publisher.\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\nnintendo Wii Sports Wii Sports Club Wii U\n\n\n\nAdam Cook\n\n\n\nEditor-in-Chief here at GodisaGeek, I organise almost every bit of content as well as running our weekly Podcast, and being the lead producer on our YouTube Channel.

With the set of five now complete it\'s hard to say how successful this approach has been, but it\'s also hardly surprising that Nintendo has opted to resort to a standard retail release, albeit with a price below the typical asking price.\n\n\n\nAll sports have had upgrades and changes, to varying degrees, for their Wii U iterations. On top of improved visuals we have online play, the Club system, Miiverse and MotionPlus / GamePad controls, all presumably with the goal of enhancing the original for a new audience.\n\n\n\nOur approach for this review, then is to compile our previous content and then introduce a new conclusion and score for the whole package — features such as Miiverse and Club features will be covered on the final page. In that way we hope this\'ll give an overall picture and, ultimately, help you decide whether the downloads or retail disc are for you. If you want to view the full original eShop reviews, however, those are linked below.\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nBowling\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nBaseball + Boxing\n\n\n\nOtherwise, click on through as we cover each sport individually, before giving a final assessment of this Wii Sports Club retail version.\n\n\n\nPage :\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nNext »\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nStats:\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nMaelstrom\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nI\'ll get it when it drops in price.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nSamurai_Goroh\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nThe disc version should have been bundled with a Wii remote plus.

Bowling is as solid as ever and Boxing is pretty similar, but both offer a nice change of pace.

I should have trusted my instinct and didn\'t buy tennis. Now I ended up buying them all just because.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\nNintenjoe64\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nYou should update your review of the Tennis. It\'s by far the best game and the lag and matching issues weren\'t there last time I played. Although it gave me tendinitis so maybe the score should stay low.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nNintenjoe64\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@Samurai_Goroh tell me about, I was kind of hoping Nintendo would come up with a deal to swap old style remotes with attachments for new ones. The most annoying bit for me is that Blockbuster was selling Wii U ones for £12 in its closing down sale and now it\'s gone\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\nrjejr\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nHoly click thru Batman - 7 pages? I realize it laid out nicely that way but please tell me this is an aberration and not going to the the standard going forward. I really hate clicking thru stories.\n\n\n\nI\'ve already complained enough about baseball having only 3 innings, that\'s just stupid. Especially b/c in golf you can choose the number of holes, and in tennis you can choose the sets. So why not baseball. Stupid. (Though if real life baseball only had 3 innings maybe Tanaka would still be pitching and not on the DL.)\n\n\n\nAlso, not only is the Gamepad hardly used, you NEED to have a Wiimote turned on JUST to access the main menu. Why can\'t I at least look around the main screen suing the Gamepad while I decide what sport I want to play?\n\n\n\n@Ryno may be right, this shipped may have sailed, and as @Samurai_Goroh said this game should be shipped w/ a WiimotePlus, it\'s NECESSARY for the game, no if ands or buts. And $40 for a game that came free w/ the $250 Wii is going to be a hard sell on a system that isn\'t selling. I think it\'s worth it for online and HD, BUT, capitalized BUT, online i sonly worth it for me if I have friends and family to play w/, and we don\'t know a single other friends or family who own a Wii U.\n\n\n\nThey should bundle this w/ 2 Wiimotes and Wii U for $299. (I think Japan had a similar family bundle a while back.) That may be a $420 MSRP value, but Wiimotes are 7 years old, do they still need to be $40 each? Even the Plus are several years old, $20 tops.\n\n\n\nJapan bundle w/ 1 Wiimote:\n\n\n\nhttp://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/02/nintendo_releasing_a_wii_sports_club_wii_u_hardware_bundle_in_japan\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\nYoshi\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nSome of these need a little updating. For example, it says that Golf has two courses when there are three: the Resort course was added in later.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\nSamurai_Goroh\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@rjejr They should at the very least have a warning in the front cover: ""Wii Remote Plus required"" like the N64 games that required the Expansion Pack did. It\'s not that explicit at all for the uninformed consumer, who might see the box art and think that at the very least his old (non-Plus) Wiimotes will work.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\nWonky_Kong\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\ni only really want baseball and golf, but baseball is packages with boxing on the e-shop\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\nNintenjoe64\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nIt\'s a bit annoying that the digital version is more expensive than the disc, there\'s no discounts on offer and owning any of the games means that you have to download all 5.

Sure they are different games/genre but come on. If I\'m Nintendo, I wouldn\'t have bothered for a remake if it\'ll only cost that less. 40 seems right. And some of you even paid less.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n90sRetroGaming\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nBought the Tennis Club Pass in November from Gamestop for $4.99 and then completed the digital version buying the remaining three Club Passes two weeks back directly from the eShop for $29.97.\n\n\n\nFactoring the 20% off eShop cards from Best Buy and the 10% back from the Deluxe Digital Promotion, the complete digital version cost me around $25 + tax. Decent deal.\n\n\n\nHad I not bought the Tennis Club Pass last year I probably would have bought the physical version of Sports Club. I\'m happy with my digital version, though.\n\n\n\nThey DO need to update and patch the issues with Boxing, though. Motions aren\'t registering correctly for whatever weird reason...\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\ncyrus_zuo\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nBaseball with the gamepad is a revelation, MUCH better than the original. So, so good!\n\n\n\nTennis is MUCH more competitive w/Motion+, but not as accessible as the original when it was just timing. It\'s not nearly as good a party game as the original, but it\'s better for long-term players.\n\n\n\nGolf is Tennis x11! Way too hard for any casual player! No party play whatsoever! Rewards players who play it A LOT! Rewards them a LOT!\n\n\n\nBowling is essentially the same as Resort. Prettier, couple of new modes. Party pleaser. Fun single-player. Poor online title b/c it\'s a slow game.\n\n\n\nBoxing I haven\'t bothered to try b/c of the reviews. Plus, Baseball! I\'m way too busy playing it!\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\nCanisWolfred\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nI actually loved playing Tennis. Golf was great, as was Bowling. Boxing always sucked, though...\n\n\n\nI\'m totally getting the Disc version soonish. Wii Sports was a good time-waster, but what I\'ve played of the other sports from the 1-day trials, this version definitely has more staying power.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\nULTRA-64\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@Samurai_Goroh 100% agree, I need a new wiimote plus and would bought this as a two for one. Now I guess I HAVE to buy a yoshi one\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\nULTRA-64\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nOn another note, this \'Wii u sports club\' fiasco is actually the perfect example of Nintendo\'s poor handling of bringing the Wii u to market. So many decision changes and mistakes in marketing have created the opposite effect of Wii sports massive success alongside the Wii, with this really representing a back track for the initial Wii u launch strategy.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\nrjejr\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@Samurai_Goroh - I\'ll be honest w/ you, I didn\'t even know this game required Plus.\n\n\n\nBut if they are going to put requirements on the box they might want to add that it requires a Wii U. I know it says Wii U on the very top of the box but I can\'t help but think a few casual players might just assume it\'s a Wii Sports sequel for the Wii. The box looks like Sports Resort.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Wii-Sports-Resort-Nintendo/dp/B004W1IX1G/ref=sr_1_7?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1405020472&sr=1-7&keywords=wii+sports+club\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\nDBPirate\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nInteresting review. The most disappointing part is that Boxing no longer supports Nunchuks as I only have 3 Wii Remote Plus controllers.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\nxerneas\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nBoxing really sucks, especially as I have to play it one-handed. Wii sports boxing was brilliant imo. Won\'t probably be buying as the online isn\'t that crowded and I mostly play off tv...\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\nMcGruber\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nThe only one I bought so far is Tennis, but the online is so atrocious that it makes me not want to buy any of the others.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\nsinalefa\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nI like this review approach, as you only read what you want to read. Still I would not pay more than $20 for the whole package.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n\nJaxonH\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nI like the game.\n\n\n\nI mean, I loved Wii Sports (who didn\'t?) and this one is better in every way. Ya, the boxing is crap but the Golf is SPECTACULAR. The baseball and bowling is really great and the tennis is pretty good too. I\'m buying this retail despite owning all 5 digitally just because I want it on disc> it\'s a classic game and I love owning physical copies of classic games.\n\n\n\nI really hope Mario Golf on Wii U takes a page out of Wii Sports Club\'s playbook and offers an option to play with the Gamepad on the ground and Wiimote to swing. Man I love golfing that way!\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n\nJaxonH\n\n\n\nThu 10th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@rjejr\n\n\n\nThere\'s also probably a few people that\'ll buy microwaves thinking they\'re AC units.\n\n\n\nBut you can\'t fix stupid.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n\nHenmii\n\n\n\nFri 11th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nNintendo, pleaaaassse let it go! At the Wii launch it was what it was: A fun demonstration of the Wiimote, with clean (but simple graphics). It did its job, attracting the masses. But the masses won\'t be tempted again with this game, and we fans don\'t need it either! Just let it go away.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n\nVollmernator\n\n\n\nFri 11th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nAlready Bought Them all Digital. It\'s Fun\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n\nrockodoodle\n\n\n\nFri 11th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nThis is a fair review. I might personally bump it up to an 8.5 if for no other reason golf and bowling are so much fun. Granted, this is coming from somebody who didn\'t play it on the Wii so much, so maybe that\'s why I\'m having more fun with it.\n\n\n\nTennis wasn\'t spoken of highly, but it\'s the game my friends go to when they play it. I went ahead and got baseball and boxing, so I can\'t comment on those. So, if you are on the fence on this and haven\'t tried the demos yet, give it a shot- that\'s what got me to buy them. I had more fun than I thought I would.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n39\n\n\n\nrjejr\n\n\n\nFri 11th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@JaxonH - I wish my microwave was an AC b/c I\'m too lazy to put the AC in the window but the microwave is just always a few feet behind me.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\nRumorlife\n\n\n\nFri 11th Jul 2014\n\n\n\nEveryone who complained about Wii Sports ""where is the online. why is this in standard def still"" Now we have Wii Sports Club. Online + HD. What you asked for. Now people say ""No way am I paying for that.

I don\'t love all the sports, but I\'m a sucker for a retail release of such things. It\'s a decent enough price on Shopto if ever you\'re interested, particularly if you end up with a Gold membership because you\'ve spent far, far too much money in recent years feeding this awful habit..\n\n\n\nHELP!\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n\nelectrolite77\n\n\n\nFri 11th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@Dankykong\n\n\n\nWho are you talking to?

It was hardly breaking news, with both titles bring published by BANDAI. They were hardly going to release C.A.R.S. up against SSB4. Just hope 2015 does not lead on to ""Cancelled"".\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\nNintenjoe64\n\n\n\nFri 11th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@akaDv8R I could smell a cancellation around the corner as soon as a major publisher got on board. Namco haven\'t been particularly cruel to Wii U owners but their support hasn\'t been massive and I\'d imagine that Pacman on Wii U sold terribly enough to scare them off any development that Nintendo didn\'t fund.\n\n\n\nTime to flood the Miiverse with complaints/worries about this delay/cancellation!\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n47\n\n\n\nakaDv8R\n\n\n\nFri 11th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@Nintenjoe64 Possibly, although Slightly Mad Studios have said from the start, they are determined to be the first developer to bring a true racing experience to the Wii U. Time will tell I guess. Hoping Hyrule Warriors and SSB4 helps shift enough consoles to warrant a release.\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\nNintenjoe64\n\n\n\nFri 11th Jul 2014\n\n\n\n@akaDv8R the problem these days is that devs have the best intentions and publishers can dump all over those intentions pretty easily once they become their paymaster.

When Nintendo first launched the Wii in 2006, I jumped in headfirst and fully embraced the concept of playing games through movement. I was hooked – I couldn’t get enough, ravenously gobbling up any game that let me put my back into a sword swing or steady my arm for a headshot. I’m one of the few people in this world who actually played Bioshock Infinite from start to finish using nothing more than a PS3 Move Sharpshooter. I’m a huge fan of motion gaming, which is why I’m so very disappointed with Nintendo’s Wii Sports Club .\n\n\n\nJust like the original, Wii Sports Club is divided into five sports: Tennis, Bowling, Golf, Baseball and Boxing, and all the basic mechanics behind each of these sports remain intact. You still swing your arm from side to side to hit the tennis ball, and bowling is as easy as pretending to hold and release the ball. I was expecting the integration of the motion plus controllers to greatly change the gameplay, but I found the difference to be negligible. While the motion plus controllers do track more of your movements, such as a tiny twist in the wrist while bowling or swinging a club, it’s not something that’s going to completely alter your playing style if you’re a pro at the original.\n\n\n\nOne of the most notable changes comes with the addition of the Wii U Gamepad, which now plays a large role in both the Golf and Baseball sports. By cleverly linking the image on the TV to the one on the GamePad, the game creates the illusion of having a golf ball at your feet that you use to accurately line up your swing. It’s an original and unique experience, and one of the best features to Wii Sports Club . Similarly, the Wii U GamePad is used in Baseball to aim your pitches and to simulate catching fly balls in the outfield, making it almost as entertaining as being up to bat.\n\n\n\nWhile it’s unfortunate that the GamePad only plays a role in these two of the five sports, the new online feature is a huge improvement across the entire board. You can still have fun playing against a computer, but everyone knows the real satisfaction comes from competing with other real humans; I’m pleased to say that the online functionality worked seamlessly for me every time. With a few clicks in the menu screen, I was quickly paired up with other gamers from around the world. Another fun twist is that players are each in control of their own selected Mii characters, giving you a somewhat general idea of the type of person you’re playing with. I like to think those two mom-looking characters that bested me in Bowling were actually pro bowlers in disguise, but then again, maybe not.\n\n\n\nEach of the five sports also comes with different training and gameplay options to help keep things interesting. There’s a whack-a-mole type minigame in the Tennis training section, and a long distance target exercise in the Golf section. My definite favorite has to be the 100-pin bowling option, which makes the feeling of landing a strike so much more satisfying.\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed I haven’t spent much time talking about the Boxing. Well, there’s a simple reason for that: I can’t stand it. Maybe it’s just me, because the guys I played against online seemed to be doing fine, but the controls in Boxing seem incredibly awkward and nonsensical. The movements are so far from 1:1 that it makes me wonder if they were even trying to match the motion. To me, the boxing is without a doubt the weakest of the five entries, which is sad because it was probably the one I was most excited about playing. As it is, I’d much prefer playing any of the other five sports than booting up the Boxing one more time.\n\n\n\nWhich brings me to my final gripe about Wii Sports Club : there’s just not enough variety. After all the many advancements in motion gaming that I’ve played since the first Wii Sports came out, playing these five sports can get old pretty quick. Even Wii Sports Resort had more going on than this. With all the canoeing, fencing and biking I did in that 2009 Wii title, this game feels like a ghost town. By comparison, the massive library of games available in Wii Fit U will gives you much more bang for your buck.\n\n\n\nWhen Wii Sports first came out as a bundle with the Wii Console, it was more of an introduction or a showcase to motion gaming than a stand-alone game. Sure, it was fun to go bowling with my dad, and it was amazing to actually play a tennis game without pushing buttons, but after the novelty of it all wore off I was left wanting more, eagerly awaiting the bright future that motion gaming would surely bring. I never imagined I’d be doing the same thing eight years later with better graphics and accessories.\n\n\n\nThere are certainly marked improvements to this updated version of the original Wii Sports , but to be completely honest, after eight years and a new generation of consoles, I was hoping for something more. Many would argue that the motion gaming revolution has already run its course, and that the ability to control a character by moving your hands has long since become a tired gimmick. Rather than challenging this notion by reinventing the genre, Nintendo missed the mark and basically reheated the same dish with some added garnish.\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\nAlright\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\nReview Guidelines\n\n\n\nRather than advancing upon the legacy of its predecessor, Wii Sports Club comes off more like an HD remake of the same old game with some additional motion plus and gamepad support. While this may have been a groundbreaking package eight years ago, today it feels altogether lackluster.\n\n\n\n— Stefan Alexander\n\n\n\nPROS\n\n\n\nOnline multiplayer makes winning much more satisfying\n\n\n\nSome creative use of the Gamepad in Golf and Baseball\n\n\n\nInteresting minigame and training options\n\n\n\nCONS\n\n\n\nFeels like a lackluster remake of an old game\n\n\n\nBoxing is awkward and unresponsive\n\n\n\nNot enough variety, the five sports get old quick\n\n\n\nOnly Baseball and Golf utilize GamePad functions\n\n\n\nStefan started gaming the day his dad brought home a shiny, brand new commodore 64.

Its status as a pack-in with the original Wii was responsible for getting the console into millions of homes (and breaking a few TVs), but it also signaled a significant change in player demographics that had been a long time coming. As the Wii U struggles to gain the sort of consumer traction its predecessor had, Nintendo has reissued the now-classic Wii Sports package, updated with a bevy of new bells and whistles. But while Wii Sports was forward-thinking in its ability to engage a different set of game players, Wii Sports Club is a clunky attempt to bring the title up to the standards of current games.\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club features the five original sports from its predecessor: Tennis, Bowling, Golf, Baseball, and Boxing. On a fundamental level, these play similarly to the original game, requiring the player to perform various motions to simulate the acts of swinging a racket, throwing a ball, or launching a punch. The Wii MotionPlus (or a Wii Remote with Wii MotionPlus built-in) is mandatory, and the additional range of gyroscopic control it provides adds a little bit more depth to these games: in Tennis, for example, it\'s a lot easier to control the type of swings you get than it was with the original Wii Remote, leading to greater control of the ball. Other games utilize the GamePad: in Golf, you position the GamePad on the floor, where it depicts the ball; you then swing the Wii Remote over the pad to hit the ball. Baseball lets you use the GamePad\'s gyroscopic features to pitch and catch the ball, which is a clever and fun new addition to the formula. For the most part, however, Wii Sports Club is all about that time-tested Wii Remote waggling.\n\n\n\nThere are no words for that mustache.\n\n\n\nBesides the main games, Wii Sports Club also features mini-games that put twists on the various sports, like launching a tennis ball to hit whack-a-mole targets, trying to bowl down unusual 100-pin patterns, and playing bingo by launching golf balls onto a grid. These games can be played solo or with friends (though not online), and make for a nice distraction if you get bored of the standard sports. These games are all quite short, however, so don\'t expect to be enthralled by them for very long.\n\n\n\nOne of the selling points of Wii Sports Club is its online features, and unfortunately, it\'s here where the collection falters the hardest. When you start the game, you\'re asked to join a regional ""club"" of your personal choosing. This isn\'t restricted by physical geography; I live in California, but I joined the Iowa club because I grew up in that state. You\'re supposed to socialize with other members of your club, forming friendships and rivalries with other territory clubs, but such socialization is uncommon because the online experience is simply not good at all.\n\n\n\nThe stands wouldn\'t be so empty if this were the real Wimbledon!\n\n\n\nFor starters, online play is restricted to very basic rules for each sport, with only bowling featuring any sort of significant rule variations to choose from. Finding opponents is also a challenge. I\'d log on during prime time in the evenings, weekends and weekdays, pick my sport of choice, and be sent to a practice room where I\'d wait for an opponent for a few minutes before being told the game couldn\'t find anyone and I would be booted back to the menu. I had the most luck finding people to play Tennis, but trying to find a person to play 100-pin Bowling was like pulling teeth. Looking at the game\'s Miiverse, I saw plenty of folks discussing their online games with others, so why wasn\'t I getting any sporting funtimes?\n\n\n\nIt has much to do with the game\'s netcode. Wii Sports Club has serious, pervasive problems with lag and stuttering during games. Players in the Miiverse universally reported the same issues, making online play a bust. But beyond the online, how is Wii Sports Club at recapturing the magic of the original Wii Sports and getting non-typical players engaged in the game? I invited a few people I knew who aren\'t frequent game-players to partake in some virtual sporting with me. While they all seemed to enjoy the games--especially the new mini-games--the GamePad options proved troublesome. (There was a lot of worry about people and pets accidentally stepping on the controller during golf in particular.) There\'s simply no substantial improvement here--nothing to make the re-release a valuable upgrade over the original.\n\n\n\nThe greens are always greener on the other side.\n\n\n\nOn top of everything is a rather confusing pricing structure: You can obtain the game as either a free download or in a retail package, but the downloadable version only lets you play for a limited time before you have to purchase a $1.99 24-hour ""day pass"" or unlimited access to individual sports for $9.99 each. The package version doesn\'t have any such restrictions, save for the minor inconvenience of having to take the disc in and out of the console, so why not offer a simple, full-access download version as well?\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club is emblematic of Nintendo\'s strange and silly approach to online games and distribution, given its unintuitive interface for finding sports partners, the consistently poor connection quality, and a pricing strategy that makes little sense. It works a lot better as a local game, but even then, it\'s not a massive improvement over the original title as a pick-up-and-play party pleaser. It\'s still great fun, particularly in short bursts, but it\'s hard to justify plunking down extra cash for Wii Sports Club.\n\n\n\nUpvote (8)\n\n\n\nLeave Blank\n\n\n\nView Comments (0)\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nApple Keynote 2018: iPhone XR Price And Release Date Announced\n\n\n\nPS4\'s Spider-Man Adding A New Game Plus Mode\n\n\n\nApple Keynote 2018: iPhone XS / XS Max Release Date, Price Announced\n\n\n\nDelayed Nintendo Direct Presentation Gets A New Date\n\n\n\nApple Keynote 2018 Event News: iPhone XS, XS Max, XR; Apple Watch Series 4\n\n\n\nThe Best Gaming And Electronic Deals Available Now!\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\nEasy-to-learn controls\n\n\n\nSimple, fun games everyone can understand\n\n\n\nEnhanced motion controls and new mini-games add greater precision\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nOnline play is garbage\n\n\n\nAwkward pricing structure\n\n\n\nThe GamePad detracts as much as it enhances\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nFair\n\n\n\nAbout GameSpot\'s Reviews\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nHeidi Kemps\n\n\n\nWii Sports is the only game that practically everybody in Heidi Kemps\' large extended family has played.

The first pitch came flying in from the stubby-looking Mii on the mound, and with an audible and satisfying crack from my Wii Remote\'s speaker, I sent it flying over the left field wall for a home run. That one swing of the bat sold me on the potential of the Wii as a new way to play games, and I certainly wasn\'t alone. The Wii dominated sales for three years on the strength of Wii Sports.\n\n\n\nIf you\'ve dreamed of playing Wii Sports in HD, your moment has arrived.\n\n\n\nToday, of course, I play Wii Sports Baseball much like everyone else: by holding up the controller with one hand and sort of waving it in the air to get my hits. It\'s just as effective, and it has the bonus of not giving me ""Wii elbow""; proof enough, perhaps, that the novelty of motion controls has long since passed. Nevertheless, there\'s still a bit of magic to be found in the newly-released Wii Sports Clubs, which is essentially an HD remake of the original Wii Sports for the Wii U. It doesn\'t amount to much more than an eight-year-old tech demo, but I had more fun than I expected revisiting boxing, baseball, bowling, tennis, and golf, most of which have been enhanced in some way for the Wii U.\n\n\n\nBowling, of course, is still the king. Though it hasn\'t been enhanced in any really discernible way outside of supporting online play, it still feels the most natural and well-realized out of the games on offer. It even goes so far as to make it possible to put spin on the ball, though it\'s done mechanically in-game rather than with the Wii Remote. Along with golf, which now supports the Wii U gamepad as a way to position the club, bowling definitely feels the most ""real"" of the Wii U collection.\n\n\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum is boxing, which is every bit as clunky as it was on the Wii, even with the addition of Wii MotionPlus support. Every punch goes out with a slow, piston-like thud, making them easy to block or otherwise avoid. Tennis, meanwhile, is fun for a few minutes, but it quickly becomes apparent how difficult it is to aim the ball. Baseball is noticeably improved thanks to the introduction of the Wii U gamepad as a second screen that can be used to track and catch flyballs, but like most baseball games, it suffers from repetitive mechanics.\n\n\n\nAll told, not much has changed in terms of actual gameplay from the days of the Wii, even with Wii MotionPlus support. Some of the sports are stronger than others, but they are all pretty shallow, making them little more than basic party games. Their strength back in 2006 was in their novelty and their promise for the future. I enjoyed Wii Sports, but I saw them as more of a proof-of-concept for motion controls than anything. I always figured that 2K or EA would come in and use Wii Sports as the basis of a serious sports sim. And to their credit, they did try. But in the end, the millions of middle-aged moms and dads who made the Wii a mega-success preferred Carnival Games and Dancing with the Stars, and the trickle of serious-minded sports games dried up.\n\n\n\nThe gamepad gets a workout in Wii Sports Club.\n\n\n\nThat\'s not to say that Wii Sports is totally without merit. I\'m surprised how well golf and bowling in particular have held up over the years, and all of the games remain easy to pick up and play. Nintendo has also done a good job of adding value to the package with sophisticated stat tracking and online play. Insane as it is to think of people logging in to bowl online, they do exist. The other night, I bowled a rousing game with a mutton-chopped Mii by the name of ""Texas,"" who serenaded me with a ""Howdy"" every time he got a strike. It\'s difficult to imagine the Wii Sports online community having any legs, but it\'s a fun alternative if you don\'t have any friends in-house willing to play a round of golf.\n\n\n\nAs for the stat tracking, I\'ll admit to being impressed by the rankings that Nintendo provides. Wii Sports takes a page from the FIFA series by encouraging players to join a club based on their location, then ranks each club by its win-loss percentage. Picking the Minnesota club also meant that I could opt to be matched up with people in my home state as well as see contextual Miiverse posts praising my successes and mocking my failures. As social integration goes, the Wii Sports clubs are surprisingly modern, and go well beyond anything available in Madden NFL. It\'s a feature that sort of makes me sad that EA has completely abandoned the Wii U. I would love for Tiburon to take a few notes from Nintendo.\n\n\n\nFor all that though, Wii Sports still isn\'t much more than a curiosity. Its commendable that Nintendo has used this opportunity to add gamepad functionality, online support, and Miiverse integration, but there\'s no hiding the fact that they\'re dressing up what was once a free pack-in meant to sell people on the potential of a now dead platform. Like the motion controls it was meant to promote, Wii Sports\' time has long since passed. But as an inexpensive party game, not to mention an oddly entertaining trip down memory lane, you could certainly do much worse.\n\n\n\nThe Nitty Gritty\n\n\n\nVisuals: It\'s Wii Sports... in HD! Experience Wii Sports\' blocky Miis and low-res textures in glorious 1080p.\n\n\n\nSound: Wii Sports\' music is pretty minimalist outside of a few catchy menu tunes, but it gets the sound effects right. The crack of the bat when hitting a ball is every bit as satisfying now as it was in 2006.\n\n\n\nInterface: Wii U\'s interface is simple but effective. It\'s quite easy to jump into an online game thanks to random matchmaking that can be accessed upon choosing a sport. The addition of gamepad support adds value to the package.\n\n\n\nLasting appeal: Wii Sports Club does its best to boost its longevity with a variety of new features, but its hampered by the deliberate simplicity of its design. Golf and bowling can be fun, but many of the mini-games get repetitive after just a couple rounds.\n\n\n\nWii Sports always felt more like a starting point than an endpoint, so it\'s kind of funny to be playing it again on the Wii U close to a decade later. It\'s an odd legacy for the motion control era, which once showed so much promise. But even if Wii Sports Club isn\'t apt to last solo players more than a weekend, it\'s a robust enough package in its own way, and its credentials as a party game are impeccable. If you\'re looking to play something with your parents, it\'s tough to go wrong with Wii Sports Club.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n/5\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club Wii U Review: Party Like it\'s 2006\n\n\n\nKat Bailey\n\n\n\nThis HD remaster holds up better than you might think, but there\'s no hiding the fact that it\'s basically an eight-year-old tech demo.\n\n\n\n2014-07-28T21:00:00-04:00\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nThis article may contain links to online retail stores.

I\'m not sure how I feel about the compilation being $40 though, especially considering that the original game was a free pack-in with most (non-Japanese) Wiis. I know it adds online leaderboards, sharper blocky graphics, and a few other bells and whistles, but Wii Sports Resort has a lot more substance while being around a similar price point to this HD remake.\n\n\n\nSign in to Reply\n\n\n\n#3\n\n\n\nkevindouglasfemmel44\n\n\n\n4 years ago\n\n\n\nWhat?

I always called that ""Big Arm"", as EA\'s The Bigs temporarily crippled me and any friends I corralled into playing. Huh. Two great games from EA on a Nintendo console. Maybe THAT was the ""unprecedented relationship"" they were thinking of.\n\n\n\nSign in to Reply\n\n\n\n#6\n\n\n\nMakgameadv\n\n\n\n4 years ago\n\n\n\nBowling in Wii Sports Resort with Wii Motion Plus was much more accurate with the control you had over the ball, so much that I had a hard time going back to the stiffness of the original Wii Sports.\n\n\n\nSign in to Reply\n\n\n\nMore from USgamer\n\n\n\nSummer Games, Summer Drinks\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\nUSgamer Team\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\nThe Last of Us Remastered PlayStation 4 Review: Surrogates and Shotguns\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\nJeremy Parish\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nForgottendo: 10 Nintendo Games You\'ve Probably Never Heard Of\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\nJeremy Parish\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider Review\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\nCaty McCarthy\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nCovering the best in video gaming.

While the original control options remain, baseball fans use the GamePad for pitching and fielding.\n\n\n\nThere is a sense that the game has lost some of the accessibility that made it so magical.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\n\nIt\'s much more engaging than the original (and slightly dangerous) wrist-flicking method used for pitching, even if it does feel less like the real thing.\n\n\n\nThe GamePad is put to even better use in golf. Placed on the floor, the GamePad shows your ball and the terrain, as players stand over the pad to swing.\n\n\n\nGolf, more than ever, feels like the real thing, requiring much more precision and a lot of practice to master, which makes getting a good score much more satisfying.\n\n\n\n©\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, boxing continues to let the team down. Even the addition of an additional Wii Remote can do little to improve what is a shallow, remote-shaking experience.\n\n\n\nThankfully, if you\'re not keen on some of the sports, Nintendo has provided flexible payment options online, which means that games like boxing can be bypassed altogether.\n\n\n\nWhile the increased accuracy and GamePad additions are great for people who have mastered the original, there is a sense that Wii Sports has lost some of the accessibility that made it so magical.\n\n\n\nIt\'s not a complicated game by any means, but it definitely takes a little more explaining and requires much more skill to master.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\n\nTo combat this, and to flesh out what is an otherwise slim experience, Nintendo has also added a host of skill games.\n\n\n\nTarget-based skill games, such as baseball\'s \'Smash Hitter\' or \'Ring Master\' mode from tennis, are a genuinely useful way of mastering different shot types.\n\n\n\nLikewise, golf mini-games will aid your short, long and putting game, while bowling\'s thoroughly enjoyable \'Shoot for the Spares\' lets players practise combination shots while picking up multipliers.\n\n\n\nNone of the mini-games are a complete disaster, but they\'re generally more functional than fun.\n\n\n\n©\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\n\nWhile there is a high-score element, and some games are better than others, it feels like you\'re playing a training mode, as opposed to a frantic, score-based alternative to the real thing.\n\n\n\nIt\'s the addition of online multiplayer where Wii Sports Club really excels.\n\n\n\nNone of the mini-games are a complete disaster, but they\'re generally more functional than fun.\n\n\n\nWhile local multiplayer will always be the preferred choice, playing online is definitely the next best thing, because you know you\'re likely to get a good game from a skilled opponent.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\n\nAnd, although beating friends or strangers should be motivation enough, Nintendo has added extra incentive by introducing sports clubs.\n\n\n\n©\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\n\nRegional sports clubs lack the intimacy and camaraderie of private clubs made up of friends, but helping your region climb the table does add a little extra spice to multiplayer battles.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the online suite is simple and speedy, while infrequent and relatively minor lag doesn\'t hamper the experience.\n\n\n\nThis sense of simplicity is further evident in the new HD visuals, which look much smoother and cleaner, but hardly showcase the power of the Wii U.\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club feels a little light on content and isn\'t quite as accessible as it once was, but it\'s still a great multiplayer game, whether played online or with friends.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nRelated Gallery\n\n\n\nWii Sports Club\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS ARTICLE\n\n\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Dark Spark review (PS4): Barely a flicker\n\n\n\nNEXT ARTICLE\n\n\n\nGods Will Be Watching review (PC): Forsaken by heaven\n\n\n\nDon\'t Miss\n\n\n\n01\n\n\n\nNew Breath of the Wild preview lands this week\n\n\n\nGIF\n\n\n\n02\n\n\n\nNintendo Switch UK price set by early pre-orders\n\n\n\n03\n\n\n\nEA is bringing one of its ""bigger games"" to the...\n\n\n\n04\n\n\n\nBreath of the Wild won\'t make Nintendo Switch...\n\n\n\n05\n\n\n\nWe\'d probably buy a Switch for this price\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n01\n\n\n\nCBB star says Roxanne can ""come back"" from punch...\n\n\n\n02\n\n\n\nBohemian Rhapsody star hits back at film\'s critics\n\n\n\nMust Read\n\n\n\n01\n\n\n\nCorrie star reacts to Jim\'s shocking new storyline\n\n\n\nGIF\n\n\n\n02\n\n\n\nWB says Henry Cavill\'s Superman future in doubt\n\n\n\nMore From\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\nDoom 2 secret finally unlocked 24 years later\n\n\n\n3 September 2018\n\n\n\n6:15 PM\n\n\n\nWait, it wasn\'t a bug?\n\n\n\nMarvel games removed from online stores without notice\n\n\n\n27 July 2018\n\n\n\n10:26 PM\n\n\n\nUltimate Alliance 1 & 2, where are you?\n\n\n\nThe Last of Us 2: Everything you need to know\n\n\n\n12 June 2018\n\n\n\n7:14 PM\n\n\n\nEllie and Joel return, but what\'s in store ?\n\n\n\nUpdated:\n\n\n\nThe Elder Scrolls 6: Everything you need to know\n\n\n\n12 June 2018\n\n\n\n5:54 PM\n\n\n\nLocation rumours, trailer details and more.\n\n\n\nPikachu was supposed to have a third evolution\n\n\n\n5 May 2018\n\n\n\n7:27 PM\n\n\n\nGorochu would\'ve followed Raichu.\n\n\n\nFIFA 18 is adding a free World Cup mode this month\n\n\n\n1 May 2018\n\n\n\n6:28 PM\n\n\n\nIt\'s your chance to get England into the finals\n\n\n\nPoundland is selling PS4 games for a fiver\n\n\n\n14 February 2018\n\n\n\n9:40 PM\n\n\n\nSee ya, Amazon.\n\n\n\nNew Kingdom Hearts III trailers include Monsters, Inc.\n\n\n\n10 February 2018\n\n\n\n10:15 AM\n\n\n\nAND a new Utada Hikaru theme song!\n\n\n\nPSN is down again and people are getting snarky\n\n\n\n28 January 2018\n\n\n\n8:10 PM\n\n\n\nGamers are trying to laugh through the tears.\n\n\n\nEverything we know so far about God of War on PS4\n\n\n\n23 January 2018\n\n\n\n7:10 PM\n\n\n\nWatch the brand-new E3 2017 gameplay trailer..\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\n\nMore From Gaming\n\n\n\n79CE8C7E-5C9C-4DEF-BB15-2756F33F3459 Created with sketchtool.\n\n\n\nTV\n\n\n\nMOVIES\n\n\n\nSOAPS\n\n\n\nFORUMS\n\n\n\nREALITY TV\n\n\n\nSHOWBIZ\n\n\n\nGAMING\n\n\n\nLGBTQ+ Spy\n\n\n\nUS TV\n\n\n\nMUSIC\n\n\n\nTECH\n\n\n\nCOMICS\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n\nMarvel\n\n\n\nSoap Spoilers\n\n\n\nGame of Thrones\n\n\n\nBig Brother\n\n\n\nStar Wars\n\n\n\nThe Grand Tour\n\n\n\nDoctor Who\n\n\n\nPeaky Blinders\n\n\n\nDC Movie Universe\n\n\n\nGood Morning Britain\n\n\n\nThe Walking Dead\n\n\n\nDIGITAL SPY, PART OF THE HEARST UK ENTERTAINMENT NETWORK © 2018 Hearst Magazines UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 72 Broadwick Street, London, W1F 9EP.

However, the game requires the use of Wii MotionPlus, unlike the original but similarly to its sequel Wii Sports Resort, in order to refine the controls and enhance the gameplay. Players are able to join different 'clubs' representing various regions across the world, and compete online with other members of the club. Players are locked into their chosen club for 24 hours, in order to create a closer sense of community.  Players are ranked within their clubs, and clubs are able to compete with and be ranked against other clubs. Miiverse communication is also supported, and players can communicate in-game using pre-set messages and drawings from the Wii U GamePad. Some of the sports also feature ideas from a concept video shown at E3 2011 when the Wii U was first unveiled. During golf, the GamePad can be placed on the floor to display the ball on the ground, using a Wii Remote to swing over it. Baseball also allows the players to use the GamePad to aim their pitches.",Wii Sports Club,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports_Club

elements come together very well , but in this case , i \\\' d be shocked if they didn \\\' t . in addition to able work by ninja theory \\\' s enslaved design team , the game \\\' s backstory was written by alex garland , who is also an unabashed game buff . any game project to which garland becomes attached is at least a minor coup for the developing studio . voice acting and motion capture for the principal character , monkey , was performed by andy serkis ( gollum in peter jackson \\\' s "" the lord of the rings "" film trilogy , as well as other acclaimed screen and television credits ) . serkis also wrote and consulted on dialogue , and his screen experience clearly comes through in enslaved \\\' s script . from the story perspective , enslaved , employing exceptional actors in other roles as well , fielded a veritable dream team of cinematic talent . you could watch this thing like a movie , and indeed the project was first proposed for an animated film , not a game .\', \'ninja theory is best known for early ps3 title heavenly sword , very good in many ways but often flawed in its gameplay elements . chief among complaints about the fantasy brawler were its abbreviated length and sometimes uninspired gameplay , requiring repetition of boss fights and certain other protracted combat sequences to even stretch the game to a short six - hour experience . in my opinion , it was one hell of a six - hour experience , but most gamers expect more play time from single - player titles with no multiplayer elements , and fairly so .\', ""while ninja theory didn \' t have much to make up for in the story elements of heavenly sword , they \' ve nicely improved things on the gameplay front . as mentioned , enslaved , which also doesn \' t have a multiplayer component ( though at least one episode of single - player dlc has already been promised ) , comes in at almost double the gameplay time of the previous title . the extended gameplay includes additional content and more sophisticated combat action , platforming and puzzles rather than just complicating existing elements and forcing the player to repeat them ."", \'enslaved takes place in a postapocalyptic world , but the studio has managed a somewhat novel turn in art direction : the colors are vibrant and rich , with a variety of wild foliage overgrowing what was once our human society . the world is populated by machines , or "" mechs , "" structurally based on human and other animal forms . while the story is rich and intriguing , explanation of the events leading to the decline of mankind is thin . fans of garland \\\' s work will recognize this process of storytelling from "" 28 days later , "" in which the story is largely about the characters and their interactions , and not very much about how things came to be .\', \'as the game opens , our reluctant heroes are captured aboard what they call a "" slaver ship "" operated by mechs and enslaved humans . the first chapter is entirely concerned with trip \\\' s escape from the ship , while monkey hitches a ride on her escape pod before the slaver vessel crashes in a future representation of new york city . trip is a young woman from a wind - farming community to the west , while monkey is a rebel without much of a cause . he \\\' s just trying to complete his life \\\' s work — and that \\\' s just staying alive in a hostile world . after their escape pod crashes , it \\\' s clear to trip that she won \\\' t make it more than a few hundred yards in any direction , let alone all the way home , without the aid of a formidable ally like monkey .\', ""trip has various skills with the sort of technology that operates the future world , and while monkey is unconscious post - crash , she fits him with one of the headbands used by the mechs to enslave humans . she \' s hacked the headband so that if she dies , monkey dies . should monkey stray too far from her in an attempt to strike out on his own , he dies as well . in the game , the growing trust and bond between trip and monkey is subtly but effectively demonstrated by greater distances monkey can wander afield of trip without trigging the punitive capacity of the headband ."", ""enslaved casts the player as monkey , with no option of taking on the role of trip , neither through the whole campaign nor even in brief discretionary episodes . there \' s no co - op play , either , though at first blush , you \' d think such a two - person cast would be ideal for a fully cooperative adventure . co - op play would almost certainly interfere with the seamless storytelling upon which enslaved greatly relies ."", ""however , monkey can do various things in interacting with trip , such as carry her through dangerous situations or , with his brute strength , toss her across chasms she \' d be unable to manage on her own . collecting red tech orbs scattered around the levels provide credits for using trip \' s knowledge to upgrade monkey \' s health and combat abilities , which consist of various close - quarters attacks and a staff that doubles as both an energized melee weapon and a sort of clumsy rifle that can fire exploding and stun rounds . these upgrades don \' t even wink at the notion of an rpg , but regularly upgrading provides the player with a sense of becoming stronger so that certain combat mechanics that seemed a little rough early on flow better in the latter half of the game . also , combat sequences improve significantly when you learn to exploit the various weaknesses of the mechs , which attack in diversified teams ."", \'monkey can direct trip to follow him at appropriate times and he can also command her to create diversions so that he can move past mechs without being cut down by ranged weapons . likewise , monkey can distract mechs from killing trip , though in the course of gameplay , this feature is rarely used .\', ""ninja theory has deftly created a more sophisticated combat experience in enslaved . it \' s not so easy to notice early on , but as the player upgrades combat abilities and weapons , and learns the strengths and weaknesses of the various foot - soldier and boss enemies , the game definitely loses the feel of a pure brawler , and tactical skills come into play . you can make it through all the chapters by merely button - mashing , but it \' s not a particularly satisfying way to do it , and you may end up unnecessarily repeating things a few times ."", ""the platforming and attendant puzzles in enslaved are fairly simple . until the last quarter of the game , it \' s very difficult to get yourself in trouble by platforming : the moves are almost automatic , and the traverses only appear perilous . there \' s certainly enough single - player content in the title without throwing in a bunch of burdensome head - scratchers , and holding up gameplay while you ponder a difficult puzzle for a half - hour or repeatedly fall off a building by mistiming jumps would certainly get in the way of telling the story in an engaging fashion ."", ""technically , enslaved is something of a mixed bag . the art direction and vision is superior . the general quality of the graphics is quite good , though on the ps3 there is noticeable tearing in scenes , and that \' s persistent throughout the game . it \' s not very distracting and doesn \' t destroy the sense of immersion , but it \' s there and you \' ll see it ."", \'the audio program , sound effects and the like are very good , but there is no dolby digital or dts compressed multichannel audio production on ps3 . it \\\' s all uncompressed sound straight off the capacious blu - ray disc . in theory , this is fantastic . with few exceptions , uncompressed audio is always better than a compressed production . until very lately , uncompressed digital multichannel audio playback has been a feature of high - end , pricey home theater receivers . unless your home theater or multichannel audio hdtv supports uncompressed multichannel sound , you \\\' re going to get two channels and two channels only . you can work around that by playing with the dsp settings on your receiver and selecting something like the "" theater "" or "" game "" audio environment simulations , but without the proper equipment , it \\\' s still not true digital multichannel sound . in fairness , this isn \\\' t an online multiplayer shooter in which you \\\' ll be concerned about failing to hear enemies sneaking up behind you , but i found it disappointing that ninja theory did not include a dolby digital or dts audio production , as they \\\' ve become nearly ubiquitous in top - tier games , especially in titles like this one , which lean toward a cinematic presentation .\', ""enslaved is one of the more captivating games i \' ve played this year , and i suspect i \' ll fondly remember it for years to come . however , i should make special note that while i can see myself playing through this game again in a year or two for the story , it \' s not something i \' m compelled to play through again soon . once you \' ve watched the final scene and the credits roll , there \' s little to go back for , unless you want to get every trophy . even the dropped hints provided by the game \' s only real collectibles are thoroughly resolved in the final scene . the game \' s plotting is not designed to leave unanswered questions once you \' ve finished playing the main narrative ."", ""still , enslaved : odyssey to the west is an instant personal favorite . more so than many top games these days , enslaved is very much reliant on the sum of its parts . while i think i could make a good argument that the story and character development would stand up quite well without the gameplay , the gameplay mechanics definitely require the resplendent flair of the well - told story to provide anything more than a strictly average experience . fortunately , enslaved ranges from consistently good to outstanding , and for that reason , i \' d recommend the title if you have an interest in single - player adventures full of masterful storytelling ."", ""\' 8 to

-\', ""enslaved : odyssey to the west is a game that i wasn \' t really that excited for but when i started playing , i was quite pleasantly surprised of how entertaining the gameplay , graphics and story unravelled . it may not challenge the world of first person adventure games but what it did offer was competent gameplay that although on the easy side , was just right ."", \'the story of enslaved : odyssey to the west is based on the chinese story of monkey magic or more specifically , journey to the west but unlike the original , this version is based several hundred years into the future . mankind has conquered the stars but unfortunately in their conquest of not only the stars but war itself , these mechs which were once their helpers have now become a dire threat to humanity . the main protagonists of the story include monkey ( andy serkis ) and tripitaka ( lindsay shaw ) or trip who have a love hate relationship and watching these characters grow as the story progresses is almost as entertaining as the gameplay itself .\', \'the story begins with trip breaking out of her cell on a futuristic prison ship that is headed towards earth . unfortunately her interference for freedom has caused the mechs of this ship to be activated and before you know it , world war iv has broken out which also forced monkey to be freed from his cell . although trip successfully navigates herself to an escape pod , monkey is forced to fend for himself in other ways which creates an interesting tutorial for the player .\', \'to make matters worse for our brutish hero , monkey manages to escape the wreck of the slave transport but is knocked for six but when he regains consciousness , trip has connected a futuristic headband to him . this headband is a slave bracelet that prevents monkey from harming her and preventing him from going against her wishes… just like the awesome tv series , monkey magic . from here , trip is using monkey to her own needs but as more snippets of the story are revealed and without spoiling it , the two are more similar than they believe .\', ""at it \' s heart , enslaved is a third person action adventure game with many of the missions require you to accompany and help trip to different parts of the gaming environments . protecting her is your main objective . if you stroll too far from trip , you will die and if trip dies… you will die which was quite frustrating at the start as you get your head around the controls . thankfully the developers have incorporated some great ai for trip who actually works with you as opposed to against you ."", \'combat plays a large role in the game as monkey uses his "" power "" staff to take down the mechs and other enemies . there are also turrets which can be controlled by monkey and as you progress , you can upgrade a variety of statistics for monkey and also equipment . trip also creates some whacky futuristic technology for monkey like attaching radar and cameras to dragonflies and you can issue trip some basic orders such as decoy or the emp weapon which knocks out mechs for a short time .\', ""although the controls are mapped well , monkey doesn \' t always walk where you want him which can be a little annoying if you are walking through a mine field or some precariously perched ledge . fighting also at times gets a little repetitive but something about these characters are so damn engaging . perhaps it was their lifelike animation or voice acting but i wanted to know more about them which helped force me to finish the game . and then you have a variety of cool upgrades for monkey and just around the corner , another awesome new environment and some strategy like lost vikings but you can only control the other character with basic commands . it worked well as you climb , explore , piggy back trip across dangerous areas and kick lots and lots of mech ass ."", \'graphically , the world of enslaved is drop dead gorgeous with amazing environments of earth taken over by nature as cities are covered in plants but dangerous mechs roam the country side . the character design is pure eye candy and it also helps that trip is kind of cute to look at . this game has parallels to uncharted in terms of environmental design and this is easily the best looking game out at the moment . the only downside is the frame rate which sometimes drops . the soundtrack is just as lush as the environments and the stars of the game are the actors andy serkis and lindsay shaw who really get into their characters and provide some good banter .\', \'in the end , enslaved : odyssey to the west had some bugs but for me , it was like watching a painter unveil his masterpiece , section by section and before you know it , the climax has come . from loveable characters to gameplay that works and an environment that is worth exploring , enslaved : odyssey to the west may be the sleeper hit of this month and also . . . the game has a great

whilst the actual gameplay was good , it was the character development that kept me hooked , and i was genuinely drawn to nariko and kai in their desperate fight for survival . the prospect of another game like that made me very excited indeed .\', \'enslaved starts with one of the main protagonists – monkey – imprisoned aboard a flying slave ship heading for parts unknown . this journey is interrupted by a young red haired woman – trip – who has snuck aboard and overloaded the systems , causing a malfunction and a fair few explosions – one of which knocks over monkey’s cell , damaging it enough for him to escape . what follows is a tutorial of sorts , as you guide monkey through the burning ship looking for an escape pod .\', \'you eventually locate an escape pod , but unfortunately trip is in it and isn’t very keen on letting monkey in – mainly because he looks enraged . the pod ejects with monkey clinging on for dear life , and crash lands some way away – knocking him unconscious . when monkey comes to he finds trip has fitted him with a slave headband , meaning he does what she says or gets zapped right in the brain with an energy pulse – oh , and if trip dies , the headband overloads and monkey dies with her . trip’s assignment is simple ; she needs to get home – which is 300 miles away across an earth destroyed by war and patrolled my ‘mechs’ – and needs monkey’s help . how can he refuse ? ( he can’t ) .\', \'the first thing you will notice about enslaved is the striking visual style that has been produced using the unreal engine . gears of war may have coined the phrase ‘destroyed beauty’ – but enslaved takes this to the next level . cities have been devastated and left for so long that nature has taken over . the juxtaposition of organic and man - made is breathtaking to behold , and on the occasion you get high enough the view of the city makes you stop in awe .\', \'at its heart enslaved is a third person adventure game in the same vein as uncharted 2 . traversing the land involves lots of climbing , puzzle solving and manipulating the surrounding environment . as his name would suggest , monkey is very athletic and as such does the bulk of the work throughout the game . climbing feels very much like it does in assassins creed – where you just have to jump in the general direction of the next hand hold and monkey will automatically snap to it . anything that can be climbed has a slight shimmer to it , and whilst some of you may not like that idea it is an absolute god send in the later levels when things get hectic – and believe me they get very hectic .\', \'trip is the electronics wizard of the pair , and can normally be found hacking doors , hatches , and generally anything with a power supply . whilst you never take control of trip directly , you do interact with her throughout the journey by carrying her over dangerous terrain , or throwing her ( yes you read that correctly ) over gaps she wouldn’t be able to jump . early on trip also takes control of a robotic dragonfly which she programmes to be monkey’s ‘eye in the sky’ – spotting landmines , scanning enemies and pointing out structural weaknesses .\', \'it’s not all about the puzzles though , as the mechs are on the prowl and hunting you down . this is where monkey’s combat staff comes in handy . the weapon has a combination of melee attacks – quick and weak , or slower more powerful hits . the staff can also be charged to release a quick burst of energy which will stun enemies with pesky shields . plasma can also be collected throughout the levels which act as ammunition for the staff , allowing it to fire energy bolts which become essential in later levels . as if that wasn’t enough the staff also provides a limited shield capability . monkey also has a ‘cloud’ which can be deployed in certain areas . this is essentially a hard to control hoverboard which allows access over dangerous ground .\', \'combat is definitely not enslaved’s strong point – which is odd considering heavenly sword was all about the fighting . the melee feels a bit cumbersome , and a lock - on feature is sorely missed as things can get very confusing .\', \'collecting ‘tech orbs’ that are scattered about allows you to purchase upgrades that will better key areas of your staff , or increase your health . if i’m being totally honest i found these upgrades a bit boring , and just ended up maxing out my health and shield .\', \'the enemy mechs you meet throughout the game are an odd bunch . the generic grunts are boring as hell , both to look at and to fight , but every time you are on the verge of becoming disinterested ninja theory pulls a surprise out of their hat and introduces one of the more gruesome varieties . i won’t spoil them all here , but i will say being tracked down by a giant mech dog was one of my more unsettling game experiences of 2010 .\', \'by far the highlight of the game though is the story and character development . alex garland provides a compelling adventure which is complimented wonderfully by nitin sawhney’s musical score . watching the relationship between monkey and trip develop is a genuine pleasure and one of my highlights of the year . a special mention also needs to go to the quality of the voice acting as it never misses a beat , or dissolves into hammy overacting as it did in some parts of heavenly sword – that game was the tester , whereas enslaved is the real deal .\', \'so that’s it then right ? awesome game – ten out of ten . alas i wish that were the case – but enslaved does have a few flaws that stop it from reaching greatness . the camera is appalling , and in the heat of battle it will frequently freak out , spin around and face anywhere but where you need it to . there are also a few occasions where you have to defeat wave after wave of enemies – and it feels like these sections could have been made a lot shorter . having to defeat so many enemies in a row is boring and a lesson in frustration .\', \'there are also a number of visual glitches such as screen tear and textures popping in and out of existence – and whilst this doesn’t bother me i know it’s a problem some people like to be made aware of . what does bother me though is some horrendous slowdown towards the end of the game when things get crazy . i appreciate there is a lot happening on screen , but i have seen games deal with a similar amount without any bother at all . top marks for ambition though – the end level is a peach !\', \'i’ve agonised over what score to give enslaved . i desperately want to give it a ten purely for its fantastic story , but a fantastic story does not a good game make – it needs the gameplay to back it up and that’s where enslaved falls down in places . what we are left with is a flawed masterpiece , but one that you definitely need to play .\', \'i may have missed it , but what was this reviewed on ? i’m under the impression that this one was a multi - format game .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 12 .\', \'as usual for multi - platform games , its engine works better on the 360 , so if you own both consoles and would like less screen tearing or framerate drops then that may be worth a look , but it’s not perfect on there either , just better .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 21 .\', \'actually , its “as usual for unreal engine 3 games . games can be done better on ps3 , read f1 2010 , final fantasy xiii and castlevania as examples . if devs put the work in , the difference can be seen !\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 18 : 35 .\', \'that’s not true for every game cc _ star .\', \'comment posted on 12 / 10 / 2010 at 03 : 23 .\', \'common like the rest of us .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 21 .\', \'this game has a great story and fantastic storytelling . i loved it and i can forgive the glitches , although i think it would have deserved a better presentation / engine .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 18 .\', \'good read , good review . i dont know why , but , i am just not exicited by this game . i might give it a look when its hovering around the £15 . 00 mark but at the moment i just dont feel the need to rush out and get it ?\', \'strange as its got a good mark from you guys too… . .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 21 .\', \'common like the rest of us .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 22 .\', \'they story is great , settigns great , the combat is a bit flawed but when you get to the half way point it kind of makes sense and you learn the eb and flow of fighting . basically go get it !\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 13 : 18 .\', \'personally i’m loving every second of it . the combat is great in my opinion once you’ve picked up the counter and focus moves to broaden things a bit . haven’t had problems with the camera either . can see what you mean though .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 24 .\', \'common like the rest of us .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 29 .\', \'haven’t had any noticeable problems with it at all – not massively far into the game yet though , chapter 5 i think .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 41 .\', \'camera that is . agree on the glitches , had a bit where the bridge didn’t go down so had to restart from the checkpoint .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 42 .\', \'nice review , very nicely written . i’ve also been following this game over the past few weeks and have really enjoyed the opening sequence you get to play in the demo . i’m going to join love film , there’s simply too many games now that deserve a playthrough or 2 , without warranting the 40 quid purchase price such as this . in future , i’ll only be actually buying games that i’ll be keeping for months and going back to time and again .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 25 .\', \'yep this for ps3 and xbox 360 , not sure which it may be better on , but considering heavenly sword was a ps3 exclusive maybe they are mmore used to working with the ps3 .\', \'comment posted on 11 / 10 / 2010 at 09 : 27 .\', \'i had lots of fun playing this game . will trophy -

beaters , cinderella squads , tournament ladders…there’s a unique culture that surrounds college basketball – some might say it leans toward being a cult , even . college hoops fans are among the most passionate and dedicated in sports ; donning facepaint or spelling out their school name across bare chests , often chanting the seemingly endless “oh” through an entire game . extreme behaviors they may seem , these acts are expressions of the fans’ pure and focused “the love of the game , ” something that gets lost in the realm of professional sports , sometimes .\', \'2k sports understands the serious emotional connection and dedication many college basketball fanatics have with their sport , and the studio continues to play toward the hardcore audience in college hoops 2k7 . though they’ve tweaked a few features to help accommodate casual ball players , college hoops remains tailored to those of us that spend hours setting up our tournament brackets , and while this makes it less accessible in some regards , overall it assures a solid amount of quality in the end experience .\', \'you might wonder how many improvements a game can make in a mere eight months ( 2k6 was released in march ) , and while the developer has focused on building around the established core , you can’t fault them too much for not tampering with the well - polished parts of their series : 2k’s great graphics , deep legacy mode , tight , realistic gameplay and overall convincing college hoops atmosphere . a couple new features help enhance the latter two qualities , namely the addition of a chant creator and the team unity factor that serves as an indicator of chemistry and compatibility for the kids on your squad .\', \'team unity is compiled from a set of bars that denote your team’s performance and overall harmony . as your players build an understanding for one another on the court , they’ll begin to mesh as a unit and ultimately play better . bringing in players off the bench isn’t always the best decision in this regard ( even though the auto - substitution has a tendency to do it freely ) , as mixing up your starters , or bringing in fresh legs off the bench to save stamina can degrade your overall unity and player attributes . either way , having to consider unity gives you another component to balance between a sea of others as you make your way through a season .\', \'the chant creator is a nice little add - in that brings some customizability to the table for 2k7 . crafting a taunt to distract opponents or making an uplifting roar to boost your squad’s spirit is a novel process , and it helps that the chant creator’s design is very simple . you can string together common words , letters , simple phrases , or mascot names in a short sequence and back them with drums . it operates similarly to a basic music mixing program , and you’ll have fun constructing serious lines like “you like camels ! ” or “fight , lets go , basketball , baby ! ” for your rabid fans to roar in the background .\', \'for newcomers to the college hoops franchise , be assured that the game gets a lot of the important points right . though it borrows nba 2k7 ’s engine , college hoops does an excellent job of translating the gameplay from the more flashy , professional level to the more strategic , team - based style that college basketball displays . charging through the lane for a dunk from the free - throw line , or trying a fade - away in traffic will have you looking silly in front of your home crowd , and unrealistic shots rarely execute smoothly . but this is how it should be . success in college basketball is built on smart ball distribution , timely scoring , and teamwork , and college hoops does a good job of encouraging this fundamental style of play , especially in simulation mode .\', \'there are a few hiccups on the hardwood , though . passing is difficult to pull off in some situations , particularly when you’re looking to lead a player down the court or coming off a screen . the right bumper helps you pass to specific teammates by allocating a button to each of them , but in fast - break situations , it just isn’t quick enough . likewise , the omission of a lead pass button is much missed . in shooting , the only major stumble the game takes is the inordinate amount of lay - ups you can expect to miss .\', \'supposedly easy shots will regularly careen off the rim if an opposing player is near you , and your players don’t always opt for the best shot selection when under the rim – usually taking a short jumper when a one - handed lay - up would do the trick . aside from these qualms , things feel pretty smooth , and the additional mapping of crossover buttons to the y and b buttons helps gamers make the leap from older basketball games to 2k’s isomotion control scheme , which favors the analog sticks .\', \'beyond the slow - paced , tactical gameplay you’ll find on the court , one of the more stunning qualities of college hoops are its visuals , led primarily by some remarkable player animations . though we’ve seen the 2000 new animations in nba 2k7 as well , that doesn’t make them any less fluid and genuinely believable – some of the most impressive are showcased in unique situations , like when a player tumbles and loses the ball if they try to draw a charge . it’s really difficult to overstate the complexity and elegance that the animations demonstrate , and it helps that they’re coated in some beautiful skin textures and convincing , flowing jersey fabrics . being able to choose between these animations in player creation is an added bonus . the crowds make the case for 2k7 ’s strong presentation as well , as they’ll jump out of their seats , wave their hands , and generally act randomly ( though convincingly ) throughout matches . seeing your student section hop up and down in unison is a real treat .\', \'speaking of 2k7 ’s create - a - player suite , it’s fantastic , and brimming with facial customization options that rival those in oblivion , even . everything from nostril width , to eyebrow height , to the concavity of your jawline can be tweaked , along with adding tattoos and accessories , like armbands . you might even say that the number of sliders and options are overwhelming , and it would’ve been nice of 2k to include a few pre - made faces to choose from .\', \'audio - wise , college hoops delivers nicely . crowd reactions and chants are at the heart of what you’ll hear , and the low murmur from your fans ( or your opponents ) helps make the key contests you’ll encounter all the more appealing . vern lundquist and bill raftery dish out some great commentary throughout games , though you can’t help but roll your eyes from time to time when raftery lets out lines like “that sure is some fancy footwork ! ” when you pull off a nice crossover .\', \'one of the depressing qualities that doesn’t hamper the gameplay , but impacts your interfacing with the game is college hoop’s dreadful menu layout . it’s designed in such a counter - intuitive way – there’s no “home” menu , and the game goes automatically to a “quick game” setup at startup . you have flip the right stick to bring up basic options , and old standbys like the start button and b button don’t function as expected . in this way , it’s easy to feel lost , especially in legacy mode , where you’re navigating a wealth of information on your players and school , and trying to balance and interpret different data . it doesn’t help that the game’s text displays so poorly on standard - definition televisions as well , with letters looking anorexic and hard to read .\', \'crisp menu design has always been a strong suit of ea’s franchises though , and not 2k’s . luckily , it’s a drop in the bucket against something of a pond - full of great , well - developed features in college hoops . though the game’s depth and detail caters to hardcore hoops fans , game after game , there are few moments that feel inauthentic in college hoops , which is a difficult point to reach for any sports title .\', ""\' whispering willows \' ( all ) comes to nintendo switch this . . .""]', '[\'spider -

control device that forces him to obey her commands and will administer a killing shock to him , if she dies . naturally this fierce loner isn \\\' t too thrilled about obeying orders from an excitable teenager , but what choice does he have ? it quickly becomes apparent that while trip is technically in control of the situation , monkey \\\' s the one with both the brawn and the survival know - how , and that creates some good tension and an almost playful back - and - forth dynamic between the two , as they scrape through frequent close encounters with the mechs , and learn more about each other in the process . the game hits you with cinematic action sequences on a regular basis . the game \\\' s dramatic scenes are among the most convincing in the business , utilizing serkis \\\' obvious flair for the dramatic , and the "" performance capture "" process made famous by avatar , to fill monkey , trip , and the game \\\' s one other meaningful speaking character with more lifelike personality and pathos than a dozen text -

your - hand school of acrobatic traversal , since it marks only certain background elements - - loose bricks , conveniently placed poles and ledges - - as climbable , and all you need to do is push the stick toward the next handhold and press the jump button . in general i have no problem with letting a game take the lead with this sort of mechanic ; the weird angles and irregular spacing of the jumps you have to make would probably be a nightmare to accomplish with looser , manual gamepad controls . though , if you \\\' re looking for a constant challenge , this isn \\\' t it ; the platforming rarely demands expert timing from you , and only a few of these sequences near the end of the game really put you under any sort of time pressure . it \\\' s easy to do , but at least it looks really cool while you \\\' re doing it . mech - ridden wasteland america is a pretty ugly place . the melee combat involving monkey and his weird electro - retractable futuristic staff weapon is more challenging and consequently more satisfying . you \\\' ve got a healthy assortment of light and heavy attacks , dodges , counters , and blocks , and the game does a good job of smoothly introducing stronger and trickier foes throughout the game that come at you in different ways and force you to actually use your entire arsenal of moves to defeat them . monkey \\\' s staff also doubles as a sort of rifle that can fire both stunning and killing energy blasts from a third - person view , and there are enemies that make you mix in these ranged attacks as well . monkey even has a hoverboard of sorts that comes into play in a few action sequences and boss fights . lastly , there \\\' s an ai - only co - op mechanic that lets trip pitch in and help you out when you ask for it . she can project a hologram to draw the mechs \\\' fire away from you for a short time so you can run from one cover point to the next , and you can also pop up from behind cover and yell at them to draw their ire back your way , so you can tell her to move up to your position . per action genre standards , there are multiple upgrade paths that let you enhance your fighting prowess , ranged attacks , health , and so on . i found the game did a good job of varying up the sorts of combat and action scenarios i was getting into so i never got bored with what was happening at the moment . step two in the "" body by monkey "" workout program . enslaved has the appearance of being entirely original , but it \\\' s actually based on the classical chinese narrative journey to the west and places some specific narrative threads from that work into its distinctive setting to create its own identity . and though the post - apocalyptic thing has been done to death in video games recently , this game has a unique take on that theme . it brings together a lot of elements , the visual design and tone of the characters chief among them , to create a vision of a shattered future that doesn \\\' t feel exactly like every other wasteland you \\\' ve seen before . i really enjoyed the dirty , clockwork look of all the technology left over from the war ; it \\\' s got a sort of retro - futuristic vibe to it , and the mech designs are all fearsome in an animalistic sort of way . in basic terms of color palette and art style , it \\\' s a rich and beautiful - looking game , though a few frame rate drops and the unreal engine \\\' s characteristic texture pop - in don \\\' t do it any favors . the game has a penchant for larger - than - life cinematic action sequences , such as an escape from a crashing airship or a battle on top of a skyscraper - sized mech , that really showcase not just the graphical fidelity but also the designs of the technology and architecture that sprung up in this game \\\' s world , centuries after the gears of modern society and industry ground to a halt . enslaved comes right at the start of the busy fourth - quarter release schedule , and given the game \\\' s modest promotional campaign up to now , this review might be the first you \\\' ve heard of it . but it \\\' s a well - produced effort that makes itself easy to get invested in and is worth considering for anyone who enjoys a solid dozen - hour - long , story - driven action game . it doesn \\\' t do everything right all the time , but some grander and higher - profile games could stand to learn a lesson or two from this one .\', \'we definitely needed to do a hand check after the first game this week . . .\', \'© 2018 cbs interactive inc . all rights reserved .\', \'facebook . com / giantbombdotcom twitter . com / giantbomb youtube . com / giantbomb instagram . com / giantbombdotcom rss\']', ""['when most people hear about a post - apocalyptic setting , images of vast gray wastelands are probably the first of many things that come to mind . these bleak backdrops would have been created due to some world war among humans where nuclear weapons played a role in their extinction , leaving nothing but desolation . in enslaved : odyssey to the west , developer ninja theory throws out most of those common conventions , and ushers in a much more vibrant take on the world after its destruction , told through a classic and old chinese tale . this is one story that is sure to captivate you from beginning to end .', 's story starts us off in the future , where only a remnant of mankind has survived from what seems to be an atrocious attack by their own design : attack mechs . while the history of this future isn’t exactly told in detail , we do catch clues of what may have happened during some of the exchanged dialogue as the game progresses . our place in the story begins with monkey and trip , who are both captive on board a slave trading vessel . after they make their escape , trip wires a slave band onto monkey’s noggin after he was knocked unconscious during their flee . the head band has now “enslaved” monkey to trip , who now needs his help to get home . if monkey disobeys trip’s commands or lets her die , then monkey will likewise perish . from here , an unlikely adventure begins .', 'one of the first things you’ll recognize about enslaved is that it is very green and lush with vegetation – quite pretty for a post - apocalyptic setting . nature has reclaimed what man has built , and the level designs really pull off that earthy and semi - organic feel . each level feels as if it’s been completely abandoned by mankind , only to be ruled by nature and the mechanized life that patrol the territories . since monkey and trip seem to be the only living humans in the dangerous lands , you may quickly feel a sense of dependency on each other to survive , even though they may have started off on the wrong foot from the beginning .', 'filling the role of monkey , you’ll slowly begin to learn how he and trip work together in a semi - symbiotic relationship . as trip’s “slave” , you’ll protect her from the mechs and help her access places out of reach when she commands you . even though monkey is made of brawn and grit , you’ll frequently call upon trip’s help too , such as her ability to distract enemies while you maneuver yourself into an advantageous position for take downs . she will also be essential to monkey for doling out health vials and providing much needed upgrades to his gear .', 'thanks to the great script penned by alex garland and the voice - overs by andy serkis and lindsay shaw , the dialogue builds such an incredible dynamic between the two characters that is life - like and believable . even the facial animations provide such strong emotional feedback during the silent pauses in the cut scenes . watching the scenes play out has an uncanny realism , closely bridging the gap between big - budget films and motion - captured game sequences . the level of care put towards those scenes makes the adventure all the more captivating , drawing upon your curiosity to push the experience forward , something that isn’t easily achievable by most games .', 'another element that will draw you into the game is the music . the orchestral pieces composed by nitin sawhney captures the emotion on the screen , whether during a cutscene or during the gameplay . during the particularly intense action sequences , the music picks up a powerful pace , then rolls off into soft ambient tones after the combat is completed , and continues during the platforming elements . the sound effects are also superbly implemented throughout the game , giving each moving object a sense of weight and purpose . however , there were a few rare instances of sound glitches when an action or voice dialogue didn’t register . the glitch wasn’t big enough of a deal to remove me from being immersed in the rich atmosphere .', 'though the cutscenes really shine visually , the graphics during gameplay are impressive as well . many times , you’ll be caught off guard with amazing panoramic views of vast landscapes that are gorgeously adorned with green life and foliage . as you progress through the game , you’ll be visiting many unique locations – from abandoned cities full of nature to desolate landscapes littered with scrap metal . however , as eye - catching the levels may seem to be , there doesn’t seem to be a consistency with the amount of amazing detail . sometimes , you’ll notice objects that were given sharp textures , and in that same setting there will be another item sporting a muddy coat of paint , as if someone forgot to give it attention . the frame rate will also stutter from time - to - time during some of the larger set - pieces , but the visuals will typically run smooth during most of your journey . such nuances are small and infrequent , but anyone with critical eye may find it distracting .', 'animations are fluid and add to the believability of both the humans and the mechs . performing actions whether in battle or scaling a wall seem to have a sense of natural movement . there are some instances though , where you’ll need to perform contextual actions with trip , which involve hoisting her up to an out - of - reach ledge or flinging her across a wide gap . here , the animations look like they could have used some work , as the action you’ll see is exactly the same every time and doesn’t carry the same fluidity of other animations . it definitely would have been nice to see some more animated variety in that area , but even that small issue isn’t enough to completely break the overall experience .', 'enslaved also utilizes platforming elements that are very reminiscent from the likes of uncharted . however , the difficulty involved to climb and jump from ledge - to - ledge is quite forgiving and simplistic . rarely ( if ever ) will monkey fall to his death from a jumping sequence . each leap while scaling a wall , or lunging out to a frail beam will connect every time . even if you were to try to force monkey off a cliff , it would prove to be impossible . if a jump action isn’t possible in a certain direction , monkey would simply hesitate or shake his head , indicating that the move isn’t able to be performed . however , as you progress through the game , the challenge involved with the platforming elements is slightly increased . yes , you still won’t fall , but you will now have to correctly time your jumps to avoid receiving damage or death , depending on the environment that you’re traversing .', 'the combat sequences are extremely fun and brutal . the control layout for fighting against the mechs are similar ( if not the same ) to ninja theory’s debut title , heavenly sword . your main combat buttons rely solely on the ‘square’ and ‘triangle’ buttons , and then ‘circle’ for a counterattack while in a guard using ‘r2 . ’ with monkey’s staff , you’ll also be able to perform ranged attacks on the mechs . at first , the mechanics for fighting are simple , requiring not much skill to reduce your adversaries into a metal paper weight . further down the campaign , you’ll encounter a few more variety of mechs where your beginner tactics won’t aide your survival . you’ll be required to employ newer strategies when defending against a group of 3 or more if you intend to keep monkey and trip alive .', 'in some areas , you’ll have to find cover from gunfire behind small stacks of brick that will collapse one piece at a time if it absorbs too much heat . situations like that will require you to constantly think on your feet while you devise a strategy before losing all of your means for cover . once you’ve figured out the timing of each different melee attack of the mechs , it will become much easier to dispatch them and move on to the next group .', 'occasionally , during a brawl you’ll be prompted with an option to perform a take down with the push of a button . performing these ruthless actions can be quite satisfying to watch , but strangely doesn’t require a button mini - game after enacting the sequence . rather , you just watch monkey tear apart the mech in glorious fashion , which isn’t a bad thing either . i just think it would’ve been more immersive to include a sequence of button prompts to make the player feel like they are in control while ripping the mech into oblivion . regardless of that missing element , the take down sequences feel great to execute , especially when unleashing the deadly moves during some of the memorable boss battles .', 'with enslaved , you will find it really easy to lose track of time , since the pacing of the story has been choreographed extremely well . the game seldom keeps you yawning as you’ll always find yourself wanting to progress the story to unlock its mysteries . new surprises seem to be waiting around each corner , which help keep the game fresh during the entire twelve - hour experience .', 'in spite of the few glitches and minor graphic issues , enslaved is one of those games that is hard to put down once you get captivated by its compelling story and memorable characters . the depth of gameplay is satisfying for any level of gamer – it’s not too deep nor is it overly complicated to chase away the curiosity of those new to the genre . the story , although not new , is definitely unique and is fresh to the industry . even with its flaws , anyone brave enough to take on this journey will not find this adventure disappointing .', 'playstationlifestyle . net is a property of mandatory , an evolve media , llc company . ©2018 all rights reserved .']"", '[""you \' ve come this far . . ."", \'a rough but worthwhile road to freedom .\', \'originally pitched to studios as an idea for a unreal engine 3 powered feature film , enslaved has instead landed on the ps3 and xbox 360 in an unenviable position : an unknown game from a formerly console exclusive developer , in a sea of high profile sequels . at first blush , enslaved might seem doomed to obscurity with minor control issues and the lack of a major first party push behind it . however , while enslaved lacks some of the polish of its blockbuster competition , a strong script , great level design , and a unique look help enslaved bring something different and interesting to the table .\', ""enslaved \' s story is set in a future after most of humanity has been destroyed . this is never really explained , but clues in the environment and off handed bits of conversation imply that there was a war involving mechs , and humans lost , one way or the other . you play as monkey , a loner who grew up alone in the wilds of the post -

apocalyptic , sci - fi road adventure mixed with plenty of giant - man - slave and tiny - sexy - slave - driver romance . while the game lacks any lasting replay value and harbours some distinct gameplay gripes , it’s an overall solid experience that has some memorable moments , a captivating story , and interesting characters .\', \'enslaved , developed by ninja theory and published by namco bandai , is set in a post - apocalyptic world , some 150 years in the future . you play as monkey , a name fitting of both his appearance and dexterity . monkey is a slave , and with the help of trip , a young tech - savvy woman , the beastly man escapes—sort of . in exchange for his salvation , trip places a headband on monkey so she can control him . her goal is to use him to return to her home , since this post -

heavy experience , we don’t want to divulge too much of the story , so we’ll not go in to any further details surrounding the game’s plot .\', \'while playing enslaved , we couldn’t help and draw comparisons to the uncharted series , albeit with less jaw - dropping visuals . nonetheless , even though monkey isn’t as well presented as the likes nathan drake and co , the visuals are still a feast for the eyes . there are moments of sheer brilliance , and other moments when you’ll notice some discernible hiccups , mostly related to shading issues . the game’s palette is mostly greens and grays as the setting is literally overgrown with vegetation - covered machinery . cut scenes appear to run on the in - game engine , meaning there are very few load transitions between actual gameplay and set story - driven cinematics . this helps draw the story , which lasts about 10 - 14 hours , and keeps the action nearly constant .\', \'enslaved has some real shining moments of triumph . for instance , the relationship between monkey and trip grows deeper as the game progresses , and the pair’s struggles increase . the game is co - written by novelist and screenwriter alex garland ( the beach , 28 days later ) , and therefore plays as a well - thought adventure . there aren’t many holes in the plot , or times you wonder “why the heck is monkey going along for the ride ? ” or , “why isn’t she scared of this brute . ” dialogue is as good as any game we’ve played in recent times , and there are virtually no one - liners . to put it simply , the real draw of enslaved is the story , the writing , and the overall themes developed as you venture through the lush wasteland .\', \'this is not a movie , a book , or a tv show—this is a videogame and is therefore interactive . so the question you are probably wondering : is the game any fun to play ? our answer : it’s a barrel of fun , but it can also be quite frustrating at times . combat is the standard button - mashing affair we’ve come to expect and actually appreciate in action games , and there are plenty of puzzles to figure ( although they are pretty simple ) . monkey is quick , agile , and has an incredible ability to take on waves of enemies ( mechs ) with his staff . the staff is his primary weapon . you’ll use it to wop mechs around , or shoot electric shocks or plasmids at distant enemies . the firing component of the staff works fairly well for a game that doesn’t focus too heavily on shooting . overall , combat is what we’ve come to expect , for better or worse .\', \'trip is essentially useless in combat . actually , that’s not entirely true—she can temporarily distract enemies for you so you can sneak in for a kill . when you do take down enemies , you’ll get orbs . these red orbs are spread throughout the game and are used to upgrade your abilities in various areas — namely , health , staff , shield , and combat . there are some other collectibles , but talking too much about them may ruin the experience for those who know nothing about the game . let’s just say that what you find clustered throughout the land will all make sense in the end .\', \'the problems we ran into with combat , and many other aspects of the game , all had to do with the camera . the right trigger controls the camera angle , and sometimes it’s hard to get it positioned well enough to see where the enemies are coming from . platforming elements , which you’ll do a lot of , are also made difficult by the often cumbersome camera . monkey’s agile nature allows him to jump around rubble like , well , a monkey . the platforming elements are pretty fun , and on later levels can get fairly difficult ( but nothing a standard gamer can’t handle ) .\', \'at the end of the day however , these flaws are not impossible to look past given the game’s well -

person action games these days . in fast succession , players encounter it all : platforming , melee combat , teamwork , vehicle and turret sequences , puzzles , stealth , shooting , and plot . this isn’t the most innovative game on the market , and it doesn’t do anything spectacularly well . but the developers made this entire smorgasbord of play styles flow into each other nicely , and virtually every aspect of enslaved feels polished and competently constructed . more important , this title is just plain fun to play and hard to put down . in short , it’s definitely worth at least a playthrough .\', \'the plot is a science - fiction take on the classic chinese story journey to the west , with some extra ideas cribbed from the world without us ( a book by alan weisman , who envisions what earth would be like without humanity and likes what he sees ) . as the game begins , it’s 150 years in the future . the protagonist , monkey , is trapped on a spaceship as a slave when all hell breaks loose and the ship starts to crash . monkey flees from his cell and makes his way to the ship’s escape pods . a fellow slave beats him to the last available pod , however , and monkey clings to the outside as the pod ejects and plummets to the ground . it lands in new york city - - or what used to be new york , anyway . the skyscrapers are crumbling , and colorful , beautiful vegetation has grown around them . there are no people , and there are no hints as to what happened to cause this state of affairs .\', \'having miraculously survived the fall ( his cartoonishly large muscles must have cushioned the blow ) , monkey awakens from unconsciousness to find himself with trip , the slave who & # 146d beat him to the escape pod . she informs him that she put a slave collar on him while he was out . this means two things : she can control his mind whenever she wants to ; and if she dies , he dies . he has no choice but to help her survive . after some initial bickering , during which monkey vows to kill trip as soon as the collar comes off , they set off to find what’s left of trip’s old village , and the adventure begins .\', \'much of the gameplay time is spent simply traversing the terrain in an almost perfectly linear manner . there’s a fair amount of uncharted - style platforming , but these sections exist more to occupy you than to challenge you . monkey springs from one handhold , pole , or ledge to another with the simple push of a button , and he’ll refuse to jump if you try to leap in the wrong direction . every once in a while , you’ll have to carry trip through some hazards , or toss her to a ledge she can’t reach on her own , or create a bridge for her to cross . the only way to die while platforming is by failing to jump quickly enough when something you’re standing on starts to fall .\', \'fortunately , the exploration is broken up by battles against the lethal mechs that now inhabit new york . by combining a few simple mechanics in an interesting way , the developers made these fights feel unique , even though there’s really nothing about them that hasn’t been done before , and better .\', \'early in the game , trip , who’s a technical whiz , wires a dragonfly to act as a spy camera . using the dragonfly , she checks out each group of mechs before you fight them . most mechs are dormant to begin with , and the dragonfly clearly indicates how far each mech can see . sometimes , there’s room enough that you can sneak past the mechs without even battling them , giving enslaved a small helping of stealth .\', \'most of the time , however , you have to fight . your weapon of choice is your staff , which can be used both to strike your enemies with light and heavy attacks , and as a gun that shoots plasma and stun rays . you also have a shield and can evade attacks . the fights can feel like button - mashing sessions sometimes , and some control issues get in the way ( the long animations make it difficult to time your button presses ) , but they do a decent job of blending mindless fun with some light strategy .\', ""steam now selling uncensored adult games pubg drops to under one million players nintendo announces nintendo switch pokemon bundles breaking down the best of sony’s pre -

writer and heavenly sword creators ninja theory on development duty . even so , the wonderful artwork , emotive characters and gloriously colourful gameworld produce an adventure that’s involving and stunning , if perhaps at times a little disassociating and automated when it comes to the nuts and bolts of the actual gameplay .', 'it begins with a chance meeting . hundreds of years in the future mankind has been ravaged by a great war leaving cities abandoned and patrolled by hostile robots – or ‘mechs’ – whilst pockets of human survivors are disparate and leaderless . aboard a slave ship heading for the mysterious ‘pyramid’ , heroes monkey and trip happen upon one another and escape together as the damaged ship crashes to the ground , and when the unconscious monkey later comes to , he finds trip has enslaved him as she needs his help travelling home . what begins as a somewhat tense and cold partnership soon grows to a mutual friendship , with master and slave soon developing genuine affection and warmth for one another .', 'the plausibility of the plot and the characters is helped exponentially by the quality of the character visuals and performances . of particular note are the faces , which are incredibly expressive and really convey emotions convincingly , even aside from the script . likewise , this visually stunning interpretation of a colourful and vegetative post - apocalyptic world feels unique and certainly makes enslaved stand out from the gamut of brown and sombre post - war worlds that inhabit the sub - genre . the cutscenes are lavish , with motion - captured performances by the main cast , and while the yarn it spins may not quite be an odyssey , it’s certainly an interesting journey across its fourteen levels , with a strong finale and an interesting twist at the end .', 'the gameplay inhabits a world somewhere between uncharted and batman : arkham asylum , with platforming and monkey clambering around like his simian namesake , mixed with combat against groups of increasingly resilient enemies . monkey wields a staff and initially can only perform a small handful of basic combos and strikes , although this can soon be built up as monkey ‘buys’ more combat options from trip , including extra health , a stronger blocking shield and new offensive moves . nonetheless , even when monkey is fully upgraded , there aren’t too many attacks or combos , and the fights never seem to flow as smoothly or satisfyingly as those in comparative action - adventures .', 'if the combat lacks depth , then it’s probably fair to say that the platforming is basically perfunctory – bordering on being fully automated , only certain ledges can be climbed up , handholds shimmer so they can’t be missed and it’s actually impossible for monkey to fall to his death , or jump from ledges unless programmed so . that’s not to say that swinging around poles or smoothly running up a drainpipe isn’t great to watch and fairly exhilarating , but the fact all challenge has been removed leaves it feeling akin to going through the motions rather than having any real sense of tangible input – if you point monkey in broadly the correct direction and press x , he’ll get to where he needs to be .', 'the camera takes a traditional third - person stance , mapped to the right analogue stick , which generally works well and allows the player to carefully scan the environment . the camera tends to be well behaved , although it does sometimes back off to a fixed viewpoint which isn’t always particularly helpful . it generally feels a bit too close to monkey though , and this can cause issues during combat where you’ll often be attacked by an enemy off - screen against whom you had almost no chance of evading or defending . it also gets trapped and jerky around scenery during interior sections which is problematic during the final sections of the game where there are a lot of indoor battles .', 'there are also some sections where monkey has to use his ‘cloud’ hover board to get through an impassable section and find a way for trip to proceed . this usually involves whizzing around the environment to destroy an obstacle or forge a path forward , and they make a nice change of pace , even if the cloud itself is a little contrived as you can only use it in specific areas . it’s also used in a couple of chase sequences where monkey has to pursue and bring down enemies , and these again provide a welcome change of pace as well as being some of the most exciting set - pieces in the game . monkey’s staff can also be used to shoot stun and plasma projectiles , and often he has to stick to cover whilst shooting across distances at mechs , which while hardly gears of war is satisfying and helps keep the gameplay varied .', 'enslaved is built using the unreal engine 3 , even if its proliferation of colour wouldn’t make you think that . the visuals are sumptuously detailed and the vistas broad and imaginative , although as a result there are some performance issues – such as screen tearing when you move the camera around , slow - loading textures during cutscenes and occasional frame rate drops . however , there’s very little which actually affects the gameplay itself , no matter how disconcerting it is when objects take two seconds for detail to pop in mid - cutscene . the characters are extremely detailed and well animated on the whole and the level of imagination and artwork that has gone into the design of this wasteland is far more imaginative than most products of the same premise . this is without question one of the game’s crowning achievements .', 'enslaved is more than the sum of its parts , because despite its flaws and issues it’s still a fun game to play , and presents a fantastic big - budget adventure in a wonderfully unique gameworld inhabited by superbly realised characters . the whole production feels like it could do with a little more depth – outside of the narrative , it feels like there’s nothing going on below the surface – but this is still a fun , awe -

breaks . that aside , they cover the floor well and respond concisely to various offensive and defensive play calls . driving to the lane is effective to some degree , but the play calling is an integral part of play . visual concepts hammers down real -

and - gun tempo or a more formal , half - court style is entirely up to you . either way is equally satisfying . the default on - screen offensive and defensive plays cover your basic calls . but they can be interchanged with additional plays from the start menu , if you like . on the default setting the ai automatically substitutes players , though it \' s nice to be able to make your own substitutions , especially when managing players \' fatigue levels ."", ""nba 2k7 is accessible to newcomers , but to truly appreciate the game , you must learn all the specific moves it has to offer . the face buttons still cover different passes and shooting , but you will often find yourself using the right stick , which subsumes many of the game \' s prominent functions . on offense the right analog initiates various dunks , lay - ups , and post - up moves , as well as your basic jump shot . for the casual player , the stick may seem to simply initiate a random animation . but the right stick actually evokes specific animations , depending on which direction you press . pressing the stick up , for example , initiates a finger roll , while pressing the stick down calls for a tear drop . press the stick by itself to perform lay - ups , or you can repeat the process while holding the right trigger for dunks . you can make the distinction of whether or not to take a hook shot or a fade - away jumper when looking to post up the defender , and better yet , you can specifically try to bank your shots off the backboard . the choice is really up to you . naturally , the league \' s bigger , less athletic players are better suited for power dunks , while the more agile players have a knack for the fancier , more dazzling finishes . either way , taking the ball to the paint and finishing the play is satisfying to watch . players just have to be aware of the context of each shot , which can make the difference between a prayer of a shot and a beautifully executed finish ."", ""as for finding the open lane , players can use a number of quick - burst crossovers and jukes to elude the defense , although holding various combinations of the left and right triggers , while stringing together multiple directions on the left stick , is easier said than done . actually , the number of button combinations could rival that of some fighting games , yet they fail to measure up in consistency . for what it \' s worth , you have a varied arsenal of jukes at your disposal , but on the same token , it \' s somewhat uninviting for the player who just wants to pick up the controller and jump right into the mix , especially when the said jukes aren \' t entirely reliable ."", ""the right analog plays an important role on defense too . again , pressing the stick in different directions initiates various defensive stances and moves . if you pull the stick away from the defender , you \' ll put your hands in the air . the remaining directions let you make a cutoff move , go for the steal , swat block , etc . considering the vast number of moves on both sides of the ball , newcomers to the series may have a hard time coming to grips with all these specifics , as it \' s understandably a lot to digest . of course , casual players can very well pick up the controls and manage to put up a decent performance . knowing how to pull off the more demanding moves can take time . and fortunately the pay off is worth the effort for those who do end up investing the time ."", ""being able to utilize so many offensive and defensive moves is not only a much - appreciated inclusion , it also lets the game flex its main selling point : signature style . every player was motion captured and the results are unbelievable . with this , you see the likenesses of each nba player come to life right on the screen . shawn marion \' s obscure way of shooting is there ; duncan \' s turn - around hook shot is there . however , it \' s not only the shots that are authentic , it \' s everything - - the way they run , the way they dribble . think of any player and the way he moves about and shoots the ball and its there , rendered to near perfection . the game \' s also robust with small nuances and intricacies . players without the ball fight for position ; cameramen stand courtside taping all the action ; coaches and players that occupy the bench fervently watch from the sideline . it \' s really a sight to see , since just as much is going on courtside as there is in the actual game . it is also worth noting how the home team mascot and cheerleaders vivaciously parade onto the court during intermissions to entertain the crowd . not enough can be said about the realistic animations , both with how they accurately represent players \' real - life tendencies and with how they all mesh together so naturally . the end result is a game that \' s overflowing with liveliness no matter where your attention may be on the court ."", ""the visuals are impressive in standard definition but still pale in comparison to a high -

life counterparts , and they animate well by conveying various facial expressions . watching players miss a shot only to scowl at their inaccuracy is just as much eye candy as seeing them celebrate after a positive play . it \' s too bad , though , that player emotion doesn \' t necessarily take into account the context of the game . a player whose team is on the verge of getting blown out shouldn \' t celebrate as much as he does after a made basket . but it \' s almost nitpicky to bring up such issues , considering how solid the presentation is as a whole ."", ""the excellent presentation is due largely to the game \' s graphical prowess . but even so , it wouldn \' t be quite as exciting if not for the excellent audio . craig sager , kenny smith , and kevin harlan return from last year to cover the play -

Their first title, Kung Fu Chaos, was released in 2003 to fairly middling reviews. It wasn\'t until 2007 when they wowed the gaming world with Heavenly Sword for the PS3. While that game had some issues it\'s free-form combat, Hollywood quality motion capture and some of the best voice acting ever featured in a video game.\n\n\n\nNow with Enslaved they have shown that Heavenly Sword was no fluke. With the contributions of Andy Serkis, the man behind Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy as well as King Kong in the remake, the visuals in this game are beyond anything else seen in video games today. Acting as director he has ensured that the motion capture is ridiculously smooth and life-like, giving these animated pixels a life of their own.\n\n\n\nWhile you\'re playing Enslaved: Odyssey to the West you\'re not just playing a video game you\'re having a movie quality experience. Serkis has brought the same astounding animations, be they body or facial, which he brought to the table with Gollum and King Bohan from Heavenly Sword. These are some of the most lifelike character models in a video game and when paired up with the star quality voice acting it just makes this game incredibly engrossing.\n\n\n\nEnslaved tells a heavily modified version of the Chinese story Journey to the West. In the original story a monk, named Xuanhong, leads a small group of companions to retrieve Buddhist scripture from India. Sun Wukong, the monkey king with an extendable staff, Zhu Bajie, a character known as Pig or Piggsy in the West who is lives up to that designation in appearance and personality, and Sha Wujing, known as Sand and being something of a minor character. With them and the monks\' steed, a dragon prince, they embark on a long and interesting journey.\n\n\n\nIn this modified version of the story the monk is replaced by Trip, a teenage girl looking to get back to her home. She uses a headband to enslave a powerful warrior named Monkey. If he doesn\'t do as he commands then she can use the headband to cause him pain, forcing him to agree to help her get home through the mech infested new world. Their trip starts off simple enough but becomes something much more emotional. Along the way they battle dozens of mechanical beasts, meet an old friend named Piggsy and they even get their own version of the dragon prince as well.\n\n\n\nIt\'s hard to discuss the story too much without getting into spoilers but it\'s quite an adventure. In many ways it\'s quite comparable to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time with it being a fairly simple story that\'s powered by the emotional growth of the heroes. As the story goes on the relationship between Monkey and Trip really develops and, thanks to the excellent voice acting, makes for a really compelling story.\n\n\n\nAs great as the story is that\'s not all there is to the title. Furthering the parallels between this game and the PoP games the title features a mix of fast paced, but simple to control, combat and platforming.\n\n\n\nCombat starts off incredibly simple as you don\'t have many options early on in the game. Monkey can use quick or strong attacks with his staff, block with an energy shield emitted by said staff or roll out of the way of incoming attacks. But as the game goes on Monkey gains the ability to fire energy blasts from the staff, perform powerful finishing moves and a variety of counter attacks that make even the hardest enemies a breeze to handle.\n\n\n\nThe platforming feels very simple as it\'s all controlled by one button although a second can be used to simplify things. All you do is aim the analog stick at where you\'re trying to go and then jump. But later on it gets tougher with obstacles that can easily kill you if you don\'t time your jumps properly. It\'s also possible to get caught by enemies while doing this making for some frantic dashes to safety as enemies open fire on you. There are also many parts where you must assist Trip to continue moving forward, throwing her across pits or up to ledges so she can move on or open the way for you.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the more interesting parts of Enslaved are when you and Trip must deal with large groups of enemies. In these sections a bit of stealth is in order so you will have to sneak around the mechs carefully. Trip can help you by showing how close you can get to mechs without waking them as well as using a holographic projector to distract all of the enemies in the area. Using this you can sneak around enemies or sneak up on turrets, tearing them to shreds or using them for your purposes. It\'s very exciting trying to get through these areas without you or Trip dying.\n\n\n\nThe visuals in this game can\'t possibly be given enough praise. Seeing the post-apocalyptic world in such a vibrant, colorful way is a breath of fresh air. This game does its best to avoid the whole ""reality is grey and brown"" visual design that\'s going on in modern gaming. Even the danker, interior levels tend to be a bit more colorful than you would expect thanks to clever lighting tricks and various indoor light sources.\n\n\n\nMore notable than that are the character models. These are some high quality models if there ever were some. Monkeys\' body tells a story all of its own with the various scars and what appear to be tattoos on his body. Trip is one of the prettiest character models to grace modern gaming while Piggsy is definitely among most disgusting. The mechs look like the titular Transformers in the recent movies, moving like the complicated machines that they are.\n\n\n\nThere are only a few things that really hold this game back from greatness. First and foremost amongst them is the camera. For 99% of the game the camera is totally under your control, easily allowing you to view the area. Unfortunately it doesn\'t lock the camera when you\'re doing some of the racing levels that occur on Monkey\'s flying Nimbus device. This means that as you speed through the level incredibly fast you also have to make small adjustments to the camera to more easily go in a straight line which can make these levels quite aggravating.\n\n\n\nAlso the combat can be a bit on the annoying side. Generally speaking the fighting is fairly exciting in Enslaved but it\'s also a bit easy. Enemies will happily attack you while you\'re trying to beat on their buddy or shoot at you while you\'re trying to stop their friend from cutting your face off. But some of the boss type enemies make up for how easy the game is by dealing heaps of damage and being annoying to dodge. One notable boss, the Rhino, must be dodged when he charges at you. But he will also bounce off the wall when you dodge; hitting you even after you avoided him. It\'s doesn\'t make the fight much more difficult but more annoying.\n\n\n\nEnslaved: Journey to the West is definitely a contender for game of the year. There are very few games these days that put this much effort into telling a compelling, emotional story and it deserves every bit of credit it can possibly get for that. While the gameplay might not be as well developed as the story it is in no way an impediment, being quite enjoyable in its own right if you\'re willing to give the game half a chance.\n\n\n\nLike what you see?

It may be hard to believe but apparently, games that take place years after something destroyed civilization actually\n\n\n\ndon’t\n\n\n\nhave to look so damn depressing.\n\n\n\nThe monotone colors and desolate wastelands made popular by other games in this genre, like the aforementioned Gears of War and Fallout series, have been replaced by lively set pieces filled with polychromatic flowers, vast green fields, sparkling oceans, and even the buildings have a personality of their own (as opposed to the concrete masses we’ve all become accustomed to).\n\n\n\nThat’s definitely not all your eyes will have to look forward to when you boot up the game because Ninja Theory’s incredible facial animating skills only seem to have become exponentially greater since their last title. The facial animations alone were enough of a reason for me to want to watch the cinematics over again. Few games can pull off interesting characters, much less\n\n\n\nrealistic\n\n\n\ncharacters.\n\n\n\nThe interactions between the brutish and crazy athletic Monkey and his captor Trip (who shares a remarkable resemblance to Heavenly Sword’s heroine Trip) make the adventure feel real, and as you progress throughout the story you’ll find yourself empathetic with both characters as they learn to rely on each other’s strengths. This connection between the player and the characters they control is an exceptionally important element for making a great game, and more importantly having that game stick with said player long after they’ve beaten it.\n\n\n\nSomehow, the developers found a way to make the enemies you destroy as unique and alluring as the world they inhabit. The basic enemies, the humanoid mechs, aren’t terribly interesting. I’m referring more to the bigger creatures you come across later in the game. They’re gaudy mechanical things I found myself wanting to stop and stare at rather than destroy. This in itself is an incredible feat.\n\n\n\nEnslaved offers quite a bit of combat (some of which can be evaded if you inspect your environment enough beforehand) and when you aren’t fighting various sized makeshift robots you’ll likely be traversing the world that’s been filled to the brim with areas that are ideal for showing off your mad platforming skills. The combat, while not perfect, is surprisingly deep. You have your basic quick attack, your strong attack, blocks, dodges, and on top of that there’s a plethora of combos, charged and ranged attacks to help you deal with essentially any situation.\n\n\n\nI was amazed at how much I enjoyed the platforming; after playing a game like Uncharted that’s practically perfected platforming in video games, Enslaved seems to have taken note of all the things that game did well and brought them into it with some tweaks here and there. Monkey is, after all, more capable of pulling off considerably more athletic undertakings that would make Nathan Drake green with envy.\n\n\n\nIn the end, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West left me bewildered by how much I loved it. I truly hope this game does well because it deserves to. When other games in its genre are busy showing off high polygon counts and big brown worlds, this is a game that isn’t afraid to show off its prettier side, and for that I commend its developer. If you’re looking for a game that offers all the amazing things I’ve spent the last handful of paragraphs gushing over as well as one of the most interesting and original stories in a game this year, Enslaved won’t disappoint.

The basic enemies, the humanoid mechs, aren’t terribly interesting. I’m referring more to the bigger creatures you come across later in the game. They’re gaudy mechanical things I found myself wanting to stop and stare at rather than destroy. This in itself is an incredible feat.\n\n\n\nEnslaved offers quite a bit of combat (some of which can be evaded if you inspect your environment enough beforehand) and when you aren’t fighting various sized makeshift robots you’ll likely be traversing the world that’s been filled to the brim with areas that are ideal for showing off your mad platforming skills. The combat, while not perfect, is surprisingly deep. You have your basic quick attack, your strong attack, blocks, dodges, and on top of that there’s a plethora of combos, charged and ranged attacks to help you deal with essentially any situation.\n\n\n\nI was amazed at how much I enjoyed the platforming; after playing a game like Uncharted that’s practically perfected platforming in video games, Enslaved seems to have taken note of all the things that game did well and brought them into it with some tweaks here and there. Monkey is, after all, more capable of pulling off considerably more athletic undertakings that would make Nathan Drake green with envy.\n\n\n\nIn the end, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West left me bewildered by how much I loved it. I truly hope this game does well because it deserves to. When other games in its genre are busy showing off high polygon counts and big brown worlds, this is a game that isn’t afraid to show off its prettier side, and for that I commend its developer. If you’re looking for a game that offers all the amazing things I’ve spent the last handful of paragraphs gushing over as well as one of the most interesting and original stories in a game this year, Enslaved won’t disappoint.\n\n\n\nSee the Game Over Online Rating System\n\n\n\nRating • • • • • 90% • • • • •\n\n\n\nWeb\n\n\n\nGame Over Online\n\n\n\nBack to Game Over Online', 'doctype html\n\n\n\nXbox 360 games, news, reviews, videos and cheats - GameSpot\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nSwitch\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nVita\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nGametech\n\n\n\nDeals\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nAll Videos\n\n\n\nTrailers\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nGravehoppers\n\n\n\nNostalgia Trip\n\n\n\nPotato Mode\n\n\n\nVersus\n\n\n\nNew Releases\n\n\n\nGameSpot Daily\n\n\n\nGameSpot Live\n\n\n\nSteam Punks\n\n\n\nReboot\n\n\n\nForums\n\n\n\nGames Discussion\n\n\n\nPC/Mac/Linux Society\n\n\n\nPlayStation Nation\n\n\n\nXbox Association\n\n\n\nNintendo Fan Club\n\n\n\nSystem Wars\n\n\n\nOff-Topic Discussion\n\n\n\nGameSpot Giveaways\n\n\n\nBug Reporting & Feedback\n\n\n\nSee all Forums\n\n\n\nSign In/Sign Up\n\n\n\nSign in / Join\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nThe Best Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nSpider-Man has starred in dozens of video games, appearing on eveything from the Atari 2600 to the PS4.

I don\'t just love gaming; I\'m compelled to play or someone would have to peel me off the ceiling every evening. I\'m an unabashed shooter fan, though I enjoy good games in any genre. We\'re passionate about offline co-op modes around here. I\'m fool enough to have bought an Atari Jaguar just for Alien vs. Predator, yet wound up suffering Cybermorph for months until the long-delayed ""launch title"" finally shipped. If it wasn\'t worth the wait, you\'ll never convince me.\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\n\nPS3 Review - \'Enslaved: Odyssey to the West\'\n\n\n\nby Sanford May on Oct. 11, 2010 @ 12:50 a.m. PDT\n\n\n\nA tactical action-adventure game, Enslaved centers on the complex relationship between the two main characters and challenges players to employ a mix of combat, strategy and environment traversal.\n\n\n\nEnslaved: Odyssey to the West is that rare thing for me in console gaming, a title in which the story development and pacing kept me playing even when I\'d usually put aside the game for a while rather than repeat a particularly arduous or nerve-wracking segment. The plot, dialogue, character development and character interaction were enough to keep me going when I tired of the action elements. I finished the game, a reasonable 10-12 hours for an average gamer on normal difficulty, in just about two long sessions.\n\n\n\nThe story and character elements come together very well, but in this case, I\'d be shocked if they didn\'t. In addition to able work by Ninja Theory\'s Enslaved design team, the game\'s backstory was written by Alex Garland, who is also an unabashed game buff. Any game project to which Garland becomes attached is at least a minor coup for the developing studio. Voice acting and motion capture for the principal character, Monkey, was performed by Andy Serkis (Gollum in Peter Jackson\'s ""The Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy, as well as other acclaimed screen and television credits). Serkis also wrote and consulted on dialogue, and his screen experience clearly comes through in Enslaved \'s script. From the story perspective, Enslaved , employing exceptional actors in other roles as well, fielded a veritable dream team of cinematic talent. You could watch this thing like a movie, and indeed the project was first proposed for an animated film, not a game.\n\n\n\nNinja Theory is best known for early PS3 title Heavenly Sword , very good in many ways but often flawed in its gameplay elements. Chief among complaints about the fantasy brawler were its abbreviated length and sometimes uninspired gameplay, requiring repetition of boss fights and certain other protracted combat sequences to even stretch the game to a short six-hour experience. In my opinion, it was one hell of a six-hour experience, but most gamers expect more play time from single-player titles with no multiplayer elements, and fairly so.\n\n\n\nWhile Ninja Theory didn\'t have much to make up for in the story elements of Heavenly Sword , they\'ve nicely improved things on the gameplay front. As mentioned, Enslaved , which also doesn\'t have a multiplayer component (though at least one episode of single-player DLC has already been promised), comes in at almost double the gameplay time of the previous title. The extended gameplay includes additional content and more sophisticated combat action, platforming and puzzles rather than just complicating existing elements and forcing the player to repeat them.\n\n\n\nEnslaved takes place in a postapocalyptic world, but the studio has managed a somewhat novel turn in art direction: The colors are vibrant and rich, with a variety of wild foliage overgrowing what was once our human society. The world is populated by machines, or ""mechs,"" structurally based on human and other animal forms. While the story is rich and intriguing, explanation of the events leading to the decline of mankind is thin. Fans of Garland\'s work will recognize this process of storytelling from ""28 Days Later,"" in which the story is largely about the characters and their interactions, and not very much about how things came to be.\n\n\n\nAs the game opens, our reluctant heroes are captured aboard what they call a ""slaver ship"" operated by mechs and enslaved humans. The first chapter is entirely concerned with Trip\'s escape from the ship, while Monkey hitches a ride on her escape pod before the slaver vessel crashes in a future representation of New York City. Trip is a young woman from a wind-farming community to the west, while Monkey is a rebel without much of a cause. He\'s just trying to complete his life\'s work — and that\'s just staying alive in a hostile world. After their escape pod crashes, it\'s clear to Trip that she won\'t make it more than a few hundred yards in any direction, let alone all the way home, without the aid of a formidable ally like Monkey.\n\n\n\nTrip has various skills with the sort of technology that operates the future world, and while Monkey is unconscious post-crash, she fits him with one of the headbands used by the mechs to enslave humans. She\'s hacked the headband so that if she dies, Monkey dies. Should Monkey stray too far from her in an attempt to strike out on his own, he dies as well. In the game, the growing trust and bond between Trip and Monkey is subtly but effectively demonstrated by greater distances Monkey can wander afield of Trip without trigging the punitive capacity of the headband.\n\n\n\nEnslaved casts the player as Monkey, with no option of taking on the role of Trip, neither through the whole campaign nor even in brief discretionary episodes. There\'s no co-op play, either, though at first blush, you\'d think such a two-person cast would be ideal for a fully cooperative adventure. Co-op play would almost certainly interfere with the seamless storytelling upon which Enslaved greatly relies.\n\n\n\nHowever, Monkey can do various things in interacting with Trip, such as carry her through dangerous situations or, with his brute strength, toss her across chasms she\'d be unable to manage on her own. Collecting red Tech Orbs scattered around the levels provide credits for using Trip\'s knowledge to upgrade Monkey\'s health and combat abilities, which consist of various close-quarters attacks and a staff that doubles as both an energized melee weapon and a sort of clumsy rifle that can fire exploding and stun rounds. These upgrades don\'t even wink at the notion of an RPG, but regularly upgrading provides the player with a sense of becoming stronger so that certain combat mechanics that seemed a little rough early on flow better in the latter half of the game. Also, combat sequences improve significantly when you learn to exploit the various weaknesses of the mechs, which attack in diversified teams.\n\n\n\nMonkey can direct Trip to follow him at appropriate times and he can also command her to create diversions so that he can move past mechs without being cut down by ranged weapons. Likewise, Monkey can distract mechs from killing Trip, though in the course of gameplay, this feature is rarely used.\n\n\n\nNinja Theory has deftly created a more sophisticated combat experience in Enslaved . It\'s not so easy to notice early on, but as the player upgrades combat abilities and weapons, and learns the strengths and weaknesses of the various foot-soldier and boss enemies, the game definitely loses the feel of a pure brawler, and tactical skills come into play. You can make it through all the chapters by merely button-mashing, but it\'s not a particularly satisfying way to do it, and you may end up unnecessarily repeating things a few times.\n\n\n\nThe platforming and attendant puzzles in Enslaved are fairly simple. Until the last quarter of the game, it\'s very difficult to get yourself in trouble by platforming: The moves are almost automatic, and the traverses only appear perilous. There\'s certainly enough single-player content in the title without throwing in a bunch of burdensome head-scratchers, and holding up gameplay while you ponder a difficult puzzle for a half-hour or repeatedly fall off a building by mistiming jumps would certainly get in the way of telling the story in an engaging fashion.\n\n\n\nTechnically, Enslaved is something of a mixed bag. The art direction and vision is superior. The general quality of the graphics is quite good, though on the PS3 there is noticeable tearing in scenes, and that\'s persistent throughout the game. It\'s not very distracting and doesn\'t destroy the sense of immersion, but it\'s there and you\'ll see it.\n\n\n\nThe audio program, sound effects and the like are very good, but there is no Dolby Digital or DTS compressed multichannel audio production on PS3. It\'s all uncompressed sound straight off the capacious Blu-ray disc. In theory, this is fantastic. With few exceptions, uncompressed audio is always better than a compressed production. Until very lately, uncompressed digital multichannel audio playback has been a feature of high-end, pricey home theater receivers. Unless your home theater or multichannel audio HDTV supports uncompressed multichannel sound, you\'re going to get two channels and two channels only. You can work around that by playing with the DSP settings on your receiver and selecting something like the ""theater"" or ""game"" audio environment simulations, but without the proper equipment, it\'s still not true digital multichannel sound. In fairness, this isn\'t an online multiplayer shooter in which you\'ll be concerned about failing to hear enemies sneaking up behind you, but I found it disappointing that Ninja Theory did not include a Dolby Digital or DTS audio production, as they\'ve become nearly ubiquitous in top-tier games, especially in titles like this one, which lean toward a cinematic presentation.\n\n\n\nEnslaved is one of the more captivating games I\'ve played this year, and I suspect I\'ll fondly remember it for years to come. However, I should make special note that while I can see myself playing through this game again in a year or two for the story, it\'s not something I\'m compelled to play through again soon. Once you\'ve watched the final scene and the credits roll, there\'s little to go back for, unless you want to get every trophy. Even the dropped hints provided by the game\'s only real collectibles are thoroughly resolved in the final scene. The game\'s plotting is not designed to leave unanswered questions once you\'ve finished playing the main narrative.\n\n\n\nStill, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is an instant personal favorite. More so than many top games these days, Enslaved is very much reliant on the sum of its parts. While I think I could make a good argument that the story and character development would stand up quite well without the gameplay, the gameplay mechanics definitely require the resplendent flair of the well-told story to provide anything more than a strictly average experience. Fortunately, Enslaved ranges from consistently good to outstanding, and for that reason, I\'d recommend the title if you have an interest in single-player adventures full of masterful storytelling.\n\n\n\nScore: 8.5/10\n\n\n\nMore articles about\n\n\n\nEnslaved: Odyssey to the West\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\n\n\n\ncomments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\nblog comments powered by\n\n\n\nDisqus\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nReviewers\n\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\n\n\nVarious Game Trailers #2734\n\n\n\nSwitch/PS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'Blacksad: Under the Skin\'\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age\'\n\n\n\n\'8 to Glory: The Official Game of the PBR\' (ALL) Gets...\n\n\n\n\'SoulCalibur VI\' (ALL) Brings Back Cervantes As Playable...\n\n\n\nEverything else\n\n\n\nJoin Us!\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n©2000-2018 Worthplaying', ""html\n\n\n\nReviews – GAMING TREND\n\n\n\nE3 2018\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nIndies\n\n\n\nVR\n\n\n\nTabletop\n\n\n\nPlatforms\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXBOX ONE\n\n\n\nSWITCH\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\nGear\n\n\n\nComics\n\n\n\nForum\n\n\n\nGAMING TREND\n\n\n\nE3 2018\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nReflect on what you’ve done — Senran Kagura Reflexions review\n\n\n\nA little bit of a weirdough — The Pizza Delivery Boy Who Saved the World review\n\n\n\nMy home is my castle — CastleStorm review\n\n\n\nYou’re not hunting her… she’s hunting you — Shadow of the Tomb Raider review\n\n\n\nGet your ∀ss to M∀rs — Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner – M∀RS review\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nYou wood not believe your eyes, Log Jammers campaign now live\n\n\n\nThe name’s Horizon, Forza Horizon 4 — Best of Bond Pack announced, demo available today\n\n\n\nNintendo Direct rescheduled and Nintendo Switch Online Service gets a release date!\n\n\n\nCutthroat and conniving scalawag Cervantes returns for SoulCalibur VI\n\n\n\nConquer the world with Revenant Dogma, out now on Xbox One\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nIndies\n\n\n\nVR\n\n\n\nTabletop\n\n\n\nPlatforms\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXBOX ONE\n\n\n\nSWITCH\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\nGear\n\n\n\nComics\n\n\n\nForum\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\nReflect on what you’ve done — Senran Kagura Reflexions review\n\n\n\nby Codi Spence\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 13, 2018\n\n\n\n170\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\nA little bit of a weirdough — The Pizza Delivery Boy Who Saved the World review\n\n\n\nby Elisha Deogracias\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 11, 2018\n\n\n\n236\n\n\n\n80\n\n\n\nMy home is my castle — CastleStorm review\n\n\n\nby Codi Spence\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n302\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n\nYou’re not hunting her… she’s hunting you — Shadow of the Tomb Raider review\n\n\n\nby Nathan Anstadt\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n559\n\n\n\n378\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\nGet your ∀ss to M∀rs — Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner – M∀RS review\n\n\n\nStarting Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner feels like tuning in halfway through a mid-season episode of an anime series you’ve...\n\n\n\nby Bryan Lawver\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\nSeptember 9, 2018\n\n\n\n441\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n\nMetro mania — Mini Metro review\n\n\n\nThe puzzle genre is not one I’m too engaged with outside of classics like Tetris and Doctor Mario.

It may not challenge the world of first person adventure games but what it did offer was competent gameplay that although on the easy side, was just right.\n\n\n\nThe story of Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is based on the Chinese story of Monkey Magic or more specifically, Journey to the West but unlike the original, this version is based several hundred years into the future. Mankind has conquered the stars but unfortunately in their conquest of not only the stars but war itself, these mechs which were once their helpers have now become a dire threat to humanity. The main protagonists of the story include Monkey (Andy Serkis) and Tripitaka (Lindsay Shaw) or Trip who have a love hate relationship and watching these characters grow as the story progresses is almost as entertaining as the gameplay itself.\n\n\n\nThe story begins with Trip breaking out of her cell on a futuristic prison ship that is headed towards Earth. Unfortunately her interference for freedom has caused the mechs of this ship to be activated and before you know it, World War IV has broken out which also forced Monkey to be freed from his cell. Although Trip successfully navigates herself to an escape pod, Monkey is forced to fend for himself in other ways which creates an interesting tutorial for the player.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse for our brutish hero, Monkey manages to escape the wreck of the slave transport but is knocked for six but when he regains consciousness, Trip has connected a futuristic headband to him. This headband is a slave bracelet that prevents Monkey from harming her and preventing him from going against her wishes… just like the awesome TV series, Monkey Magic . From here, Trip is using Monkey to her own needs but as more snippets of the story are revealed and without spoiling it, the two are more similar than they believe.\n\n\n\nAt it\'s heart, Enslaved is a third person action adventure game with many of the missions require you to accompany and help Trip to different parts of the gaming environments. Protecting her is your main objective. If you stroll too far from Trip, you will die and if Trip dies… you will die which was quite frustrating at the start as you get your head around the controls. Thankfully the developers have incorporated some great AI for Trip who actually works with you as opposed to against you.\n\n\n\nCombat plays a large role in the game as Monkey uses his ""power"" staff to take down the mechs and other enemies. There are also turrets which can be controlled by Monkey and as you progress, you can upgrade a variety of statistics for Monkey and also equipment. Trip also creates some whacky futuristic technology for Monkey like attaching radar and cameras to dragonflies and you can issue Trip some basic orders such as decoy or the EMP weapon which knocks out mechs for a short time.\n\n\n\nAlthough the controls are mapped well, Monkey doesn\'t always walk where you want him which can be a little annoying if you are walking through a mine field or some precariously perched ledge. Fighting also at times gets a little repetitive but something about these characters are so damn engaging. Perhaps it was their lifelike animation or voice acting but I wanted to know more about them which helped force me to finish the game. And then you have a variety of cool upgrades for Monkey and just around the corner, another awesome new environment and some strategy like Lost Vikings but you can only control the other character with basic commands. It worked well as you climb, explore, piggy back Trip across dangerous areas and kick lots and lots of mech ass.\n\n\n\nGraphically, the world of Enslaved is drop dead gorgeous with amazing environments of Earth taken over by nature as cities are covered in plants but dangerous mechs roam the country side. The character design is pure eye candy and it also helps that Trip is kind of cute to look at. This game has parallels to Uncharted in terms of environmental design and this is easily the best looking game out at the moment. The only downside is the frame rate which sometimes drops. The soundtrack is just as lush as the environments and the stars of the game are the actors Andy Serkis and Lindsay Shaw who really get into their characters and provide some good banter.\n\n\n\nIn the end, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West had some bugs but for me, it was like watching a painter unveil his masterpiece, section by section and before you know it, the climax has come. From loveable characters to gameplay that works and an environment that is worth exploring, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West may be the sleeper hit of this month and also... the game has a great checkpoint system!

Whilst the actual gameplay was good, it was the character development that kept me hooked, and I was genuinely drawn to Nariko and Kai in their desperate fight for survival. The prospect of another game like that made me very excited indeed.\n\n\n\nEnslaved starts with one of the main protagonists – Monkey – imprisoned aboard a flying slave ship heading for parts unknown. This journey is interrupted by a young red haired woman – Trip – who has snuck aboard and overloaded the systems, causing a malfunction and a fair few explosions – one of which knocks over Monkey’s cell, damaging it enough for him to escape. What follows is a tutorial of sorts, as you guide Monkey through the burning ship looking for an escape pod.\n\n\n\nYou eventually locate an escape pod, but unfortunately Trip is in it and isn’t very keen on letting Monkey in – mainly because he looks enraged. The pod ejects with Monkey clinging on for dear life, and crash lands some way away – knocking him unconscious. When Monkey comes to he finds Trip has fitted him with a slave headband, meaning he does what she says or gets zapped right in the brain with an energy pulse – oh, and if Trip dies, the headband overloads and Monkey dies with her. Trip’s assignment is simple; she needs to get home – which is 300 miles away across an Earth destroyed by war and patrolled my ‘Mechs’ – and needs Monkey’s help. How can he refuse? (He can’t).\n\n\n\nThe first thing you will notice about Enslaved is the striking visual style that has been produced using the Unreal Engine. Gears of War may have coined the phrase ‘Destroyed Beauty’ – but Enslaved takes this to the next level. Cities have been devastated and left for so long that nature has taken over. The juxtaposition of organic and man-made is breathtaking to behold, and on the occasion you get high enough the view of the city makes you stop in awe.\n\n\n\nAt its heart Enslaved is a third person adventure game in the same vein as Uncharted 2. Traversing the land involves lots of climbing, puzzle solving and manipulating the surrounding environment. As his name would suggest, Monkey is very athletic and as such does the bulk of the work throughout the game. Climbing feels very much like it does in Assassins Creed – where you just have to jump in the general direction of the next hand hold and Monkey will automatically snap to it. Anything that can be climbed has a slight shimmer to it, and whilst some of you may not like that idea it is an absolute God send in the later levels when things get hectic – and believe me they get very hectic.\n\n\n\nTrip is the electronics wizard of the pair, and can normally be found hacking doors, hatches, and generally anything with a power supply. Whilst you never take control of Trip directly, you do interact with her throughout the journey by carrying her over dangerous terrain, or throwing her (yes you read that correctly) over gaps she wouldn’t be able to jump. Early on Trip also takes control of a robotic dragonfly which she programmes to be Monkey’s ‘eye in the sky’ – spotting landmines, scanning enemies and pointing out structural weaknesses.\n\n\n\nIt’s not all about the puzzles though, as the Mechs are on the prowl and hunting you down. This is where Monkey’s combat staff comes in handy. The weapon has a combination of melee attacks – quick and weak, or slower more powerful hits. The staff can also be charged to release a quick burst of energy which will stun enemies with pesky shields. Plasma can also be collected throughout the levels which act as ammunition for the staff, allowing it to fire energy bolts which become essential in later levels. As if that wasn’t enough the staff also provides a limited shield capability. Monkey also has a ‘Cloud’ which can be deployed in certain areas. This is essentially a hard to control hoverboard which allows access over dangerous ground.\n\n\n\nCombat is definitely not Enslaved’s strong point – which is odd considering Heavenly Sword was all about the fighting. The melee feels a bit cumbersome, and a lock-on feature is sorely missed as things can get very confusing.\n\n\n\nCollecting ‘Tech Orbs’ that are scattered about allows you to purchase upgrades that will better key areas of your staff, or increase your health. If I’m being totally honest I found these upgrades a bit boring, and just ended up maxing out my health and shield.\n\n\n\nThe enemy Mechs you meet throughout the game are an odd bunch. The generic grunts are boring as hell, both to look at and to fight, but every time you are on the verge of becoming disinterested Ninja Theory pulls a surprise out of their hat and introduces one of the more gruesome varieties. I won’t spoil them all here, but I will say being tracked down by a giant Mech dog was one of my more unsettling game experiences of 2010.\n\n\n\nBy far the highlight of the game though is the story and character development. Alex Garland provides a compelling adventure which is complimented wonderfully by Nitin Sawhney’s musical score. Watching the relationship between Monkey and Trip develop is a genuine pleasure and one of my highlights of the year. A special mention also needs to go to the quality of the voice acting as it never misses a beat, or dissolves into hammy overacting as it did in some parts of Heavenly Sword – that game was the tester, whereas Enslaved is the real deal.\n\n\n\nSo that’s it then right? Awesome game – ten out of ten. Alas I wish that were the case – but Enslaved does have a few flaws that stop it from reaching greatness. The camera is appalling, and in the heat of battle it will frequently freak out, spin around and face anywhere but where you need it to. There are also a few occasions where you have to defeat wave after wave of enemies – and it feels like these sections could have been made a lot shorter. Having to defeat so many enemies in a row is boring and a lesson in frustration.\n\n\n\nThere are also a number of visual glitches such as screen tear and textures popping in and out of existence – and whilst this doesn’t bother me I know it’s a problem some people like to be made aware of. What does bother me though is some horrendous slowdown towards the end of the game when things get crazy. I appreciate there is a lot happening on screen, but I have seen games deal with a similar amount without any bother at all. Top marks for ambition though – the end level is a peach!\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\n\nFantastic visual style\n\n\n\nGreat musical score\n\n\n\nCompelling story\n\n\n\nCharacter development\n\n\n\nNice combination of puzzles and platforming\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nAppalling camera\n\n\n\nCombat can get repetitive\n\n\n\nLots of glitches\n\n\n\nSlowdown\n\n\n\nI’ve agonised over what score to give Enslaved. I desperately want to give it a ten purely for its fantastic story, but a fantastic story does not a good game make – it needs the gameplay to back it up and that’s where Enslaved falls down in places. What we are left with is a flawed masterpiece, but one that you definitely need to play.\n\n\n\nScore: 8/10\n\n\n\nRead more: # Enslaved: Odyssey To The West\n\n\n\n52 Comments\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nNext »\n\n\n\nKamokazi-UK\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\n\nSince: Sep 2009\n\n\n\nI may have missed it, but what was this reviewed on?

They both applied to Duke.\n\n\n\nYes, college basketball is back. Let the heckling, face-painting and ""Oh"" chanting begin.\n\n\n\nThe solid brand of basketball gameplay returns in College Hoops 2K7 , along with everything else from 2K6. In fact, aside from some minor control tweaks and a few updated menus, the latest offering from 2K Sports is practically identical to 2K6. That\'s a good thing, in a way, considering 2K6 was an impressive title. But it\'s also a lazy way to end the current-generation, and if you already have 2K6, it\'s hard to recommend a purchase for what amounts to little more than a roster update on the Xbox. If 2K had put in the same effort as it did the 360 version, then we\'d have something. What we have left is a good basketball game that needs a kick in the pants moving forward.\n\n\n\nOn the floor, a decent three-dimensional crowd cheers your every move. It\'s the same crowd noise from the last few years, but a few team-specific chants will get you in the mood to paint your face, or at least to keep playing through Legacy mode.\n\n\n\nLegacy is among the deepest franchise modes in sports games. With in-depth recruiting, a fun and often hilarious email system, training camps for high school players, Ju-Co transfers, coaching charisma and team meetings, you\'ll have a lot to do. None of the slick features that went into the 360 made its way down to current-gen, however. Bryant Gumbel and Clark Kellogg return in the studio with Selection Sunday and a season kickoff-show, which are great touches. While their lip synching is laughable and they move like animatronic characters better suited to entertain ankle-biters at Chuck E. Cheese\'s, the information is great. You\'ve got your preseason All Americans and top rankings, and the crew has something to say about everything.\n\n\n\nThe basic gamemodes appear, including rivalry games, the campus store, and the Pontiac Tournament. For some reason, 2K did not update the seedings from 2K6. What\'s worse, 2K6 wasn\'t updated from 2K5. That\'s just plain sloppy. If you want to set up a bracket with proper rankings, you\'ll have to do it yourself.\n\n\n\nBut what matters most is gameplay, and 2K7 will be no stranger to you if you\'ve played previous 2K Sports basketball games. Isomotion, the system of crossovers and dribble moves, returns, although you\'ll have a very tough time trying to crack the defense for a bucket. You\'ll need to work the ball, probe the zone, kick in and out, and utilize a nice array of post moves in order to score. That is what has made the 2K basketball games the best around for many years. The controls have been tweaked a bit from 2K6 to resemble NBA 2K7, so you have a nice hop-step button, the strip-and-rip steal system on the right stick, and, of course, the shot stick.\n\n\n\nWhat holds the gameplay back are the same old things from years gone by. Players miss way too many lay-ups and put-backs if a defender is nearby. Passing is a bit slow and the animations, while smooth and good-looking, are sometimes too slow and hold up the action. Catching and passing immediately is a problem on fast breaks, especially when players go through a long, drawn out catching animation instead of pop-pop-popping the ball down the court. Steals are ridiculous as you can sometime tally more than 10 a game with one player.\n\n\n\nDriving past opponents, controlled by the CPU at least, is more difficult than ever. Defenders no longer break their ankles on every juke you throw out there, and too often a drive to the rim results in a collision with a defender where he simply arm-bars you backward. It\'s a block or a charge or some kind of whistle in real life, but not here. You can drive over and over into a defender and he\'ll keep pushing you away in the same canned animation. This makes for a much lower-scoring game, also thanks to decent help defense and a combination of zone formations you don\'t seen in the NBA.\n\n\n\nOn defense, your squad does an admirable job of helping out, when needed. There are some questionable switches at times, where point guards will end up on a center. There are a number of nice zone formations to use, the only complaint being that the players could be more aggressive in denying passes inside. So if you\'re in a 2-3 and the ball is on the left wing with a forward on the left block and the other three offensive players to the right, it shouldn\'t be a problem for defensive center and the forward on the ball to deny that pass inside. Too often, it is.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, the sound and graphics are virtually the same as last year. Vern Lundquist and Bill Raftery do a fine job in the booth, although they could stand to get a bit more excited at times. Nothing beats the duo of Nessler and Vitale in March Madness, but that\'s the benchmark. The crowd is exactly the same as last year, which is frustrating because it sounds so much better on the 360 and not here. Visually, the game looks decent, with smooth animations and a great framerate, although the crowd is made up of triangle people.\n\n\n\nYou can also take your game on Xbox Live for typical 2K Sports options, like online leagues and tourneys -- still the best online system out there for sports titles.\n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\n2K Sport created a very impressive game... on the Xbox 360. College Hoops 2K7 on the Xbox is more of a cut-and-paste job of 2K6, with virtually identical graphics and sound. A few nice control tweaks like the jump stop, doesn\'t add anything fresh however. While the presentation, Legacy and online play are all great, 2K7 feels more like a roster update. It\'s a great value if you don\'t have 2K6 and love college hoops. If you do own College Hoops, you may just want to update your rosters.\n\n\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\nCollege Hoops 2K7\n\n\n\nReleased Nov. 20th, 2006\n\n\n\nXbox 360 Xbox PS3 PS2\n\n\n\nGood\n\n\n\n28 Nov 2006\n\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nRead our review standards\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nPresentation\n\n\n\nWho doesn\'t love virtual Gumble?

College hoops fans are among the most passionate and dedicated in sports; donning facepaint or spelling out their school name across bare chests, often chanting the seemingly endless “Oh” through an entire game. Extreme behaviors they may seem, these acts are expressions of the fans’ pure and focused “the love of the game,” something that gets lost in the realm of professional sports, sometimes.\n\n\n\n2K Sports understands the serious emotional connection and dedication many college basketball fanatics have with their sport, and the studio continues to play toward the hardcore audience in College Hoops 2K7 . Though they’ve tweaked a few features to help accommodate casual ball players, College Hoops remains tailored to those of us that spend hours setting up our tournament brackets, and while this makes it less accessible in some regards, overall it assures a solid amount of quality in the end experience.\n\n\n\nYou might wonder how many improvements a game can make in a mere eight months ( 2K6 was released in March), and while the developer has focused on building around the established core, you can’t fault them too much for not tampering with the well-polished parts of their series: 2K’s great graphics, deep Legacy mode, tight, realistic gameplay and overall convincing college hoops atmosphere. A couple new features help enhance the latter two qualities, namely the addition of a chant creator and the Team Unity factor that serves as an indicator of chemistry and compatibility for the kids on your squad.\n\n\n\nTeam Unity is compiled from a set of bars that denote your team’s performance and overall harmony. As your players build an understanding for one another on the court, they’ll begin to mesh as a unit and ultimately play better. Bringing in players off the bench isn’t always the best decision in this regard (even though the auto-substitution has a tendency to do it freely), as mixing up your starters, or bringing in fresh legs off the bench to save stamina can degrade your overall unity and player attributes. Either way, having to consider unity gives you another component to balance between a sea of others as you make your way through a season.\n\n\n\nThe chant creator is a nice little add-in that brings some customizability to the table for 2K7 . Crafting a taunt to distract opponents or making an uplifting roar to boost your squad’s spirit is a novel process, and it helps that the chant creator’s design is very simple. You can string together common words, letters, simple phrases, or mascot names in a short sequence and back them with drums. It operates similarly to a basic music mixing program, and you’ll have fun constructing serious lines like “You like camels!” or “Fight, lets go, basketball, baby!” for your rabid fans to roar in the background.\n\n\n\nFor newcomers to the College Hoops franchise, be assured that the game gets a lot of the important points right. Though it borrows NBA 2K7 ’s engine, College Hoops does an excellent job of translating the gameplay from the more flashy, professional level to the more strategic, team-based style that college basketball displays. Charging through the lane for a dunk from the free-throw line, or trying a fade-away in traffic will have you looking silly in front of your home crowd, and unrealistic shots rarely execute smoothly. But this is how it should be. Success in college basketball is built on smart ball distribution, timely scoring, and teamwork, and College Hoops does a good job of encouraging this fundamental style of play, especially in simulation mode.\n\n\n\nThere are a few hiccups on the hardwood, though. Passing is difficult to pull off in some situations, particularly when you’re looking to lead a player down the court or coming off a screen. The right bumper helps you pass to specific teammates by allocating a button to each of them, but in fast-break situations, it just isn’t quick enough. Likewise, the omission of a lead pass button is much missed. In shooting, the only major stumble the game takes is the inordinate amount of lay-ups you can expect to miss.\n\n\n\nSupposedly easy shots will regularly careen off the rim if an opposing player is near you, and your players don’t always opt for the best shot selection when under the rim – usually taking a short jumper when a one-handed lay-up would do the trick. Aside from these qualms, things feel pretty smooth, and the additional mapping of crossover buttons to the Y and B buttons helps gamers make the leap from older basketball games to 2K’s Isomotion control scheme, which favors the analog sticks.\n\n\n\nBeyond the slow-paced, tactical gameplay you’ll find on the court, one of the more stunning qualities of College Hoops are its visuals, led primarily by some remarkable player animations. Though we’ve seen the 2000 new animations in NBA 2K7 as well, that doesn’t make them any less fluid and genuinely believable – some of the most impressive are showcased in unique situations, like when a player tumbles and loses the ball if they try to draw a charge. It’s really difficult to overstate the complexity and elegance that the animations demonstrate, and it helps that they’re coated in some beautiful skin textures and convincing, flowing jersey fabrics. Being able to choose between these animations in player creation is an added bonus. The crowds make the case for 2K7 ’s strong presentation as well, as they’ll jump out of their seats, wave their hands, and generally act randomly (though convincingly) throughout matches. Seeing your student section hop up and down in unison is a real treat.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of 2K7 ’s create-a-player suite, it’s fantastic, and brimming with facial customization options that rival those in Oblivion, even. Everything from nostril width, to eyebrow height, to the concavity of your jawline can be tweaked, along with adding tattoos and accessories, like armbands. You might even say that the number of sliders and options are overwhelming, and it would’ve been nice of 2K to include a few pre-made faces to choose from.\n\n\n\nAudio-wise, College Hoops delivers nicely. Crowd reactions and chants are at the heart of what you’ll hear, and the low murmur from your fans (or your opponents) helps make the key contests you’ll encounter all the more appealing. Vern Lundquist and Bill Raftery dish out some great commentary throughout games, though you can’t help but roll your eyes from time to time when Raftery lets out lines like “That sure is some fancy footwork!” when you pull off a nice crossover.\n\n\n\nOne of the depressing qualities that doesn’t hamper the gameplay, but impacts your interfacing with the game is College Hoop’s dreadful menu layout. It’s designed in such a counter-intuitive way – there’s no “home” menu, and the game goes automatically to a “quick game” setup at startup. You have flip the right stick to bring up basic options, and old standbys like the start button and B button don’t function as expected. In this way, it’s easy to feel lost, especially in Legacy mode, where you’re navigating a wealth of information on your players and school, and trying to balance and interpret different data. It doesn’t help that the game’s text displays so poorly on standard-definition televisions as well, with letters looking anorexic and hard to read.\n\n\n\nCrisp menu design has always been a strong suit of EA’s franchises though, and not 2K’s. Luckily, it’s a drop in the bucket against something of a pond-full of great, well-developed features in College Hoops . Though the game’s depth and detail caters to hardcore hoops fans, game after game, there are few moments that feel inauthentic in College Hoops , which is a difficult point to reach for any sports title.\n\n\n\nScore: 8.1 / 10\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\n\n\n\ncomments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\nblog comments powered by\n\n\n\nDisqus\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nReviewers\n\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\n\n\n\'Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey\' (ALL) Goes Gold\n\n\n\nFormer Riot Games Vets Start New Game Studio, Singularity 6\n\n\n\n\'Space Junkies\' Closed Beta Date Set - Screens & Trailer\n\n\n\n\'Assault Spy\' Gets Release Date\n\n\n\n\'Whispering Willows\' (ALL) Comes to Nintendo Switch This...\n\n\n\nEverything else\n\n\n\nJoin Us!\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n©2000-2018 Worthplaying', 'doctype html\n\n\n\nEnslaved: Odyssey to the West Review - Giant Bomb\n\n\n\nGiantBomb.com\n\n\n\nMass Alex: Mass Effect - Part 07\n\n\n\nLatest Premium Content\n\n\n\nBecome Premium to Watch\n\n\n\nAll\n\n\n\nWiki\n\n\n\nFranchises\n\n\n\nGames\n\n\n\nAccessories\n\n\n\nCharacters\n\n\n\nCompanies\n\n\n\nConcepts\n\n\n\nLocations\n\n\n\nObjects\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\nPlatforms\n\n\n\nEditorial\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nArticles\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nCommunity\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\nA A\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nWiki Games Franchises Characters Platforms People Companies Objects Concepts Locations Accessories\n\n\n\nNew Games\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nLatest Reviews\n\n\n\nReview: Marvel\'s Spider-Man\n\n\n\nSpider-Man combines elements from plenty of other games to deliver a game with expansive combat, exciting traversal, and a solid, authentic story.\n\n\n\nGod of War Review\n\n\n\nSony Santa Monica makes us care about Kratos in this stunning revival of the series.\n\n\n\nFar Cry 5 Review\n\n\n\nFar Cry 5\'s story is a real let-down, but the action still makes for a solid co-op experience.\n\n\n\nVideos Popular Latest Best of Giant Bomb Breaking Brad Endurance Run Events Extra Life Features Premium Trailers Mass Alex Demo Derby The Exquisite Corps Game Tapes Get in the Ring Giant Bombcast Mario Party Party Murder Island Old Games Playdate Quick Looks Ranking of Fighters Thirteen Deadly Sims This Is the Run Unfinished Unprofessional Fridays VRodeo\n\n\n\nPodcasts Giant Bombcast The Giant Beastcast Giant Bombcast (Premium) The Giant Beastcast (Premium) Giant Bombcast Aftermath!

Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a simple story told with subtlety and heart, about two intertwined survivors making their way across a wasteland America in the wake of some catastrophic future war. A fair amount of Hollywood talent got involved in this game--the story is by Sunshine and The Beach writer Alex Garland , and Andy Serkis ( The Lord of the Rings \' Gollum ) directed the dramatic sequences and voiced the main character--and they earn their places in the credits as you see nuanced, believable relationships building between Enslaved\'s tiny cast of speaking characters over the course of their grueling journey. The game\'s mix of melee combat and acrobatic platforming satisfies more often than not, but even when the gameplay gets awkward, the plight of the survivors is engaging and touching enough to drive you onward to the story\'s conclusion. Monkey is a capable, muscled nomad making his solitary way through the wastes. Trip is a technically adept but fragile young girl stranded hundreds of miles from her secluded farming community. She needs to safely cover those miles and elude roving bands of killer robots, the remnants of the war that destroyed civilization. She needs Monkey. So she secretly fits him with a mind-control device that forces him to obey her commands and will administer a killing shock to him, if she dies. Naturally this fierce loner isn\'t too thrilled about obeying orders from an excitable teenager, but what choice does he have? It quickly becomes apparent that while Trip is technically in control of the situation, Monkey\'s the one with both the brawn and the survival know-how, and that creates some good tension and an almost playful back-and-forth dynamic between the two, as they scrape through frequent close encounters with the mechs, and learn more about each other in the process. The game hits you with cinematic action sequences on a regular basis. The game\'s dramatic scenes are among the most convincing in the business, utilizing Serkis\' obvious flair for the dramatic, and the ""performance capture"" process made famous by Avatar , to fill Monkey, Trip, and the game\'s one other meaningful speaking character with more lifelike personality and pathos than a dozen text-heavy role-playing games. Technically that\'s because there are actual people behind not just the voiceover (which is superb) but also the body language, facial tics, and zillion other subtle elements that make these characters seem quite real. Performance capture must still be a pretty expensive or unwieldy process, otherwise every developer would use it in their cutscenes all the time. The results speak for themselves. Even outside the cinematics, the game does a great job of developing its characters, owing to the snappy and genuinely funny banter between them, and I realized I honestly cared about what was going to happen to them only an hour or two into the game. Actually playing Enslaved is largely like bouncing between Prince of Persia and God of War . From a crumbling, heavily jungled New York City to a mechanized facility run by the slavers who are trying to subjugate what\'s left of society, there\'s a lot of stuff to climb on. The game subscribes to the hold-your-hand school of acrobatic traversal, since it marks only certain background elements--loose bricks, conveniently placed poles and ledges--as climbable, and all you need to do is push the stick toward the next handhold and press the jump button. In general I have no problem with letting a game take the lead with this sort of mechanic; the weird angles and irregular spacing of the jumps you have to make would probably be a nightmare to accomplish with looser, manual gamepad controls. Though, if you\'re looking for a constant challenge, this isn\'t it; the platforming rarely demands expert timing from you, and only a few of these sequences near the end of the game really put you under any sort of time pressure. It\'s easy to do, but at least it looks really cool while you\'re doing it. Mech-ridden wasteland America is a pretty ugly place. The melee combat involving Monkey and his weird electro-retractable futuristic staff weapon is more challenging and consequently more satisfying. You\'ve got a healthy assortment of light and heavy attacks, dodges, counters, and blocks, and the game does a good job of smoothly introducing stronger and trickier foes throughout the game that come at you in different ways and force you to actually use your entire arsenal of moves to defeat them. Monkey\'s staff also doubles as a sort of rifle that can fire both stunning and killing energy blasts from a third-person view, and there are enemies that make you mix in these ranged attacks as well. Monkey even has a hoverboard of sorts that comes into play in a few action sequences and boss fights. Lastly, there\'s an AI-only co-op mechanic that lets Trip pitch in and help you out when you ask for it. She can project a hologram to draw the mechs\' fire away from you for a short time so you can run from one cover point to the next, and you can also pop up from behind cover and yell at them to draw their ire back your way, so you can tell her to move up to your position. Per action genre standards, there are multiple upgrade paths that let you enhance your fighting prowess, ranged attacks, health, and so on. I found the game did a good job of varying up the sorts of combat and action scenarios I was getting into so I never got bored with what was happening at the moment. Step two in the ""Body By Monkey"" workout program. Enslaved has the appearance of being entirely original, but it\'s actually based on the classical Chinese narrative Journey to the West and places some specific narrative threads from that work into its distinctive setting to create its own identity. And though the post-apocalyptic thing has been done to death in video games recently, this game has a unique take on that theme. It brings together a lot of elements, the visual design and tone of the characters chief among them, to create a vision of a shattered future that doesn\'t feel exactly like every other wasteland you\'ve seen before. I really enjoyed the dirty, clockwork look of all the technology left over from the war; it\'s got a sort of retro-futuristic vibe to it, and the mech designs are all fearsome in an animalistic sort of way. In basic terms of color palette and art style, it\'s a rich and beautiful-looking game, though a few frame rate drops and the Unreal Engine \'s characteristic texture pop-in don\'t do it any favors. The game has a penchant for larger-than-life cinematic action sequences, such as an escape from a crashing airship or a battle on top of a skyscraper-sized mech, that really showcase not just the graphical fidelity but also the designs of the technology and architecture that sprung up in this game\'s world, centuries after the gears of modern society and industry ground to a halt. Enslaved comes right at the start of the busy fourth-quarter release schedule, and given the game\'s modest promotional campaign up to now, this review might be the first you\'ve heard of it. But it\'s a well-produced effort that makes itself easy to get invested in and is worth considering for anyone who enjoys a solid dozen-hour-long, story-driven action game. It doesn\'t do everything right all the time, but some grander and higher-profile games could stand to learn a lesson or two from this one.\n\n\n\nBrad Shoemaker on Google+\n\n\n\nLoad Comments\n\n\n\nGame Name Enslaved: Odyssey to the West Platform(s) Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 Games Store PlayStation Network (PS3) PC Publisher(s) Namco Developer(s) Ninja Theory Genres Action-Adventure Themes Fantasy Sci-Fi Post-Apocalyptic First Release Date Oct 05, 2010 ESRB ESRB: T\n\n\n\nPopular on Giant Bomb\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n\nUnprofessional Fridays: 09/07/2018\n\n\n\nWe DEFINITELY needed to do a hand check after the first game this week...\n\n\n\n54 Premium\n\n\n\nvideo\n\n\n\nGBE Playdate - Spider-Man 2 (09/07/18)\n\n\n\n108 Premium\n\n\n\nvideo\n\n\n\nMass Alex: Mass Effect - Part 07\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n\nvideo\n\n\n\nUnfinished: Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 Blackout BETA 09/11/2018\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n\nvideo\n\n\n\nGBE Playdate: Definitely Not Trials Rising [Beta] (09/12/2018)\n\n\n\n89 Premium\n\n\n\nvideo\n\n\n\nLoad Our Last SNESaves\n\n\n\n355\n\n\n\nreview\n\n\n\nReview: Marvel\'s Spider-Man\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\nvideo\n\n\n\nQuick Look: Scythe - Digital Edition\n\n\n\n57\n\n\n\nvideo\n\n\n\nQuick Look: Marvel\'s Spider-Man\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\nvideo\n\n\n\nGiant Bombcast 549: Reboot the Pearl!\n\n\n\nGamespot.com\n\n\n\n© 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

These bleak backdrops would have been created due to some world war among humans where nuclear weapons played a role in their extinction, leaving nothing but desolation. In Enslaved: Odyssey to the West , developer Ninja Theory throws out most of those common conventions, and ushers in a much more vibrant take on the world after its destruction, told through a classic and old Chinese tale. This is one story that is sure to captivate you from beginning to end.\n\n\n\nEnslaved’\n\n\n\ns story starts us off in the future, where only a remnant of mankind has survived from what seems to be an atrocious attack by their own design: attack mechs. While the history of this future isn’t exactly told in detail, we do catch clues of what may have happened during some of the exchanged dialogue as the game progresses. Our place in the story begins with Monkey and Trip, who are both captive on board a slave trading vessel. After they make their escape, Trip wires a slave band onto Monkey’s noggin after he was knocked unconscious during their flee. The head band has now “enslaved” Monkey to Trip, who now needs his help to get home. If Monkey disobeys Trip’s commands or lets her die, then Monkey will likewise perish. From here, an unlikely adventure begins.\n\n\n\nOne of the first things you’ll recognize about Enslaved is that it is very green and lush with vegetation – quite pretty for a post-apocalyptic setting. Nature has reclaimed what man has built, and the level designs really pull off that earthy and semi-organic feel. Each level feels as if it’s been completely abandoned by mankind, only to be ruled by nature and the mechanized life that patrol the territories. Since Monkey and Trip seem to be the only living humans in the dangerous lands, you may quickly feel a sense of dependency on each other to survive, even though they may have started off on the wrong foot from the beginning.\n\n\n\nFilling the role of Monkey, you’ll slowly begin to learn how he and Trip work together in a semi-symbiotic relationship. As Trip’s “slave”, you’ll protect her from the mechs and help her access places out of reach when she commands you. Even though Monkey is made of brawn and grit, you’ll frequently call upon Trip’s help too, such as her ability to distract enemies while you maneuver yourself into an advantageous position for take downs. She will also be essential to Monkey for doling out health vials and providing much needed upgrades to his gear.\n\n\n\nThanks to the great script penned by Alex Garland and the voice-overs by Andy Serkis and Lindsay Shaw, the dialogue builds such an incredible dynamic between the two characters that is life-like and believable. Even the facial animations provide such strong emotional feedback during the silent pauses in the cut scenes. Watching the scenes play out has an uncanny realism, closely bridging the gap between big-budget films and motion-captured game sequences. The level of care put towards those scenes makes the adventure all the more captivating, drawing upon your curiosity to push the experience forward, something that isn’t easily achievable by most games.\n\n\n\nAnother element that will draw you into the game is the music. The orchestral pieces composed by Nitin Sawhney captures the emotion on the screen, whether during a cutscene or during the gameplay. During the particularly intense action sequences, the music picks up a powerful pace, then rolls off into soft ambient tones after the combat is completed, and continues during the platforming elements. The sound effects are also superbly implemented throughout the game, giving each moving object a sense of weight and purpose. However, there were a few rare instances of sound glitches when an action or voice dialogue didn’t register. The glitch wasn’t big enough of a deal to remove me from being immersed in the rich atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThough the cutscenes really shine visually, the graphics during gameplay are impressive as well. Many times, you’ll be caught off guard with amazing panoramic views of vast landscapes that are gorgeously adorned with green life and foliage. As you progress through the game, you’ll be visiting many unique locations – from abandoned cities full of nature to desolate landscapes littered with scrap metal. However, as eye-catching the levels may seem to be, there doesn’t seem to be a consistency with the amount of amazing detail. Sometimes, you’ll notice objects that were given sharp textures, and in that same setting there will be another item sporting a muddy coat of paint, as if someone forgot to give it attention. The frame rate will also stutter from time-to-time during some of the larger set-pieces, but the visuals will typically run smooth during most of your journey. Such nuances are small and infrequent, but anyone with critical eye may find it distracting.\n\n\n\nAnimations are fluid and add to the believability of both the humans and the mechs. Performing actions whether in battle or scaling a wall seem to have a sense of natural movement. There are some instances though, where you’ll need to perform contextual actions with Trip, which involve hoisting her up to an out-of-reach ledge or flinging her across a wide gap. Here, the animations look like they could have used some work, as the action you’ll see is exactly the same every time and doesn’t carry the same fluidity of other animations. It definitely would have been nice to see some more animated variety in that area, but even that small issue isn’t enough to completely break the overall experience.\n\n\n\nEnslaved also utilizes platforming elements that are very reminiscent from the likes of Uncharted . However, the difficulty involved to climb and jump from ledge-to-ledge is quite forgiving and simplistic. Rarely (if ever) will Monkey fall to his death from a jumping sequence. Each leap while scaling a wall, or lunging out to a frail beam will connect every time. Even if you were to try to force Monkey off a cliff, it would prove to be impossible. If a jump action isn’t possible in a certain direction, Monkey would simply hesitate or shake his head, indicating that the move isn’t able to be performed. However, as you progress through the game, the challenge involved with the platforming elements is slightly increased. Yes, you still won’t fall, but you will now have to correctly time your jumps to avoid receiving damage or death, depending on the environment that you’re traversing.\n\n\n\nThe combat sequences are extremely fun and brutal. The control layout for fighting against the mechs are similar (if not the same) to Ninja Theory’s debut title, Heavenly Sword . Your main combat buttons rely solely on the ‘square’ and ‘triangle’ buttons, and then ‘circle’ for a counterattack while in a guard using ‘R2.’ With Monkey’s staff, you’ll also be able to perform ranged attacks on the mechs. At first, the mechanics for fighting are simple, requiring not much skill to reduce your adversaries into a metal paper weight. Further down the campaign, you’ll encounter a few more variety of mechs where your beginner tactics won’t aide your survival. You’ll be required to employ newer strategies when defending against a group of 3 or more if you intend to keep Monkey and Trip alive.\n\n\n\nIn some areas, you’ll have to find cover from gunfire behind small stacks of brick that will collapse one piece at a time if it absorbs too much heat. Situations like that will require you to constantly think on your feet while you devise a strategy before losing all of your means for cover. Once you’ve figured out the timing of each different melee attack of the mechs, it will become much easier to dispatch them and move on to the next group.\n\n\n\nOccasionally, during a brawl you’ll be prompted with an option to perform a take down with the push of a button. Performing these ruthless actions can be quite satisfying to watch, but strangely doesn’t require a button mini-game after enacting the sequence. Rather, you just watch Monkey tear apart the mech in glorious fashion, which isn’t a bad thing either. I just think it would’ve been more immersive to include a sequence of button prompts to make the player feel like they are in control while ripping the mech into oblivion. Regardless of that missing element, the take down sequences feel great to execute, especially when unleashing the deadly moves during some of the memorable boss battles.\n\n\n\nWith Enslaved , you will find it really easy to lose track of time, since the pacing of the story has been choreographed extremely well. The game seldom keeps you yawning as you’ll always find yourself wanting to progress the story to unlock its mysteries. New surprises seem to be waiting around each corner, which help keep the game fresh during the entire twelve-hour experience.\n\n\n\nIn spite of the few glitches and minor graphic issues, Enslaved is one of those games that is hard to put down once you get captivated by its compelling story and memorable characters. The depth of gameplay is satisfying for any level of gamer – it’s not too deep nor is it overly complicated to chase away the curiosity of those new to the genre. The story, although not new, is definitely unique and is fresh to the industry.

At first blush, Enslaved might seem doomed to obscurity with minor control issues and the lack of a major first party push behind it. However, while Enslaved lacks some of the polish of its blockbuster competition, a strong script, great level design, and a unique look help Enslaved bring something different and interesting to the table.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nEnslaved's story is set in a future after most of humanity has been destroyed. This is never really explained, but clues in the environment and off handed bits of conversation imply that there was a war involving mechs, and humans lost, one way or the other. You play as Monkey, a loner who grew up alone in the wilds of the post-apocalypse. After being captured by a group of slavers, Monkey is freed in the midst of another prisoner's escape. After crashing to the ground, Monkey finds himself enslaved - a young woman named Trip has bound Monkey to her will using a control headband, demanding that he help her find her way home. Monkey's fate is tied to Trip's. If her heart stops, he dies. And their journey begins.\n\n\n\nEnslaved is a beautiful game, for the most part. Set in the post post-apocalypse, Ninja Theory has nonetheless filled the world of Enslaved with bright greens and reds, evoking a sense of a world moving past the end of humanity. Its character design is also strong and distinctive, though there is a certain amount of love it or hate it involved. Personally, I enjoyed the Chinese-fable-meets-Road-Warrior costumes and the animalistic mechs that feature prominently, and Ninja Theory manage to present destroyed but recognizable landmarks, barely skirting heavy-handed territory.\n\n\n\nThere are problems though. There are some bizarre graphical glitches and hiccups throughout the game. Occasionally cutscenes will break, leading to characters' voices acting without their bodies and other bizarre moments. There's also some major framerate issues throughout the game, particularly on the PS3. These range from distracting to debilitating from a gameplay perspective, but luckily, they're uncommon.\n\n\n\nIt's a SCARF, not a TAIL.\n\n\n\nLess avoidable are controls that feel overly loose for an action game. Monkey takes much longer to respond to input from the controller than he should. We're talking visually noticeable delays in response for most actions. Heavenly Sword had a similar problem, and there's a learning curve as you grow to compensate for it.\n\n\n\nLuckily, Enslaved's extensive platforming errs on the charitable side. In the post-post-apocalypse, there are massive obstacles that impede Trip and Monkey in their travels, and it's typically up to Monkey to get them past it. Monkey is capable of deft acrobatic feats, jumping from handhold to pole to ledge and back again, but there's never any danger involved (well, almost never). Instead, traversal tends toward puzzle more than platforming. Levels are designed to be figured out, save for scenes that will require Monkey to quickly find a way to Trip before Mechs can. Monkey is also responsible for moving Trip at times, whether that means throwing her up to ledges, or carrying her on his back when things become especially dangerous.\n\n\n\nEnslaved's combat is less interesting. Monkey doesn't have much in the way of versatility with his energy-charged staff, though he certainly has enough skill to take care of any challenges thrown his way. There's just not much to mix things up or experiment, and the only real difference that rears its head in standard battles is the number and type of enemies you fight - and even those don't change up much.\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNext »\n\n\n\nWiki Guide 57 Pages\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\nAHS: Apocalypse Kicked Things Off with...The End\n\n\n\nUpdate: Nintendo Switch Getting 6.0.0 Update Next Week\n\n\n\nWhy It's Insane That Warner Bros.

First, we need to see stories not based around a post-apocalyptic climate. Second, we need to see games that possess a movie-like quality play like an actual videogame, as opposed to merely having us sitting there feeling like we aren’t in the driving seat. And third, we need to stop thinking that one day machines will rule our lives—although, that may sound silly as this review is being written on a computer and we played the game on a machine. OK, machines will probably one day rule us all, but in the meantime, let’s try to find some other clichés to exploit for a while.\n\n\n\nEnslaved: Odyssey to the West takes all those common clichés from videogames past and present, and attempts to capture players’ attention in an epic post-apocalyptic, sci-fi road adventure mixed with plenty of giant-man-slave and tiny-sexy-slave-driver romance. While the game lacks any lasting replay value and harbours some distinct gameplay gripes, it’s an overall solid experience that has some memorable moments, a captivating story, and interesting characters.\n\n\n\nEnslaved, developed by Ninja Theory and published by Namco Bandai, is set in a post-apocalyptic world, some 150 years in the future. You play as Monkey, a name fitting of both his appearance and dexterity. Monkey is a slave, and with the help of Trip, a young tech-savvy woman, the beastly man escapes—sort of. In exchange for his salvation, Trip places a headband on Monkey so she can control him. Her goal is to use him to return to her home, since this post-apocalyptic world isn’t fit for a tiny little girl.\n\n\n\nThe game plays like a movie. Actually, it plays like it’s based on a movie. It’s a sprawling adventure that takes players through a wasteland of an overgrown city, clearly once a triumphant, but now under control of some force that seeks to enslave all people. Obviously in such a narrative-heavy experience, we don’t want to divulge too much of the story, so we’ll not go in to any further details surrounding the game’s plot.\n\n\n\nWhile playing Enslaved, we couldn’t help and draw comparisons to the Uncharted series, albeit with less jaw-dropping visuals. Nonetheless, even though Monkey isn’t as well presented as the likes Nathan Drake and co, the visuals are still a feast for the eyes. There are moments of sheer brilliance, and other moments when you’ll notice some discernible hiccups, mostly related to shading issues. The game’s palette is mostly greens and grays as the setting is literally overgrown with vegetation-covered machinery. Cut scenes appear to run on the in-game engine, meaning there are very few load transitions between actual gameplay and set story-driven cinematics. This helps draw the story, which lasts about 10-14 hours, and keeps the action nearly constant.\n\n\n\nEnslaved has some real shining moments of triumph. For instance, the relationship between Monkey and Trip grows deeper as the game progresses, and the pair’s struggles increase. The game is co-written by novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland (The Beach, 28 Days later), and therefore plays as a well-thought adventure. There aren’t many holes in the plot, or times you wonder “why the heck is Monkey going along for the ride?” Or, “why isn’t she scared of this brute.” Dialogue is as good as any game we’ve played in recent times , and there are virtually no one-liners. To put it simply, the real draw of Enslaved is the story, the writing, and the overall themes developed as you venture through the lush wasteland.\n\n\n\nThis is not a movie, a book, or a TV show—this is a videogame and is therefore interactive. So the question you are probably wondering: is the game any fun to play? Our answer: It’s a barrel of fun, but it can also be quite frustrating at times. Combat is the standard button-mashing affair we’ve come to expect and actually appreciate in action games, and there are plenty of puzzles to figure (although they are pretty simple). Monkey is quick, agile, and has an incredible ability to take on waves of enemies (mechs) with his staff. The staff is his primary weapon. You’ll use it to wop mechs around, or shoot electric shocks or plasmids at distant enemies. The firing component of the staff works fairly well for a game that doesn’t focus too heavily on shooting. Overall, combat is what we’ve come to expect, for better or worse.\n\n\n\nTrip is essentially useless in combat. Actually, that’s not entirely true—she can temporarily distract enemies for you so you can sneak in for a kill. When you do take down enemies, you’ll get orbs. These red orbs are spread throughout the game and are used to upgrade your abilities in various areas — namely, health, staff, shield, and combat. There are some other collectibles, but talking too much about them may ruin the experience for those who know nothing about the game. Let’s just say that what you find clustered throughout the land will all make sense in the end.\n\n\n\nThe problems we ran into with combat, and many other aspects of the game, all had to do with the camera. The right trigger controls the camera angle, and sometimes it’s hard to get it positioned well enough to see where the enemies are coming from. Platforming elements, which you’ll do a lot of, are also made difficult by the often cumbersome camera. Monkey’s agile nature allows him to jump around rubble like, well, a monkey. The platforming elements are pretty fun, and on later levels can get fairly difficult (but nothing a standard gamer can’t handle).\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day however, these flaws are not impossible to look past given the game’s well-paced story. Enslaved is worth the time and commitment, even though there are frustrating moments given the sluggish gameplay mechanics. Still, we’ll have to wait and see what DLC becomes available to see if the game will gain any legs, but for now it’s well worth the experience, even if it’s just to play through the story. It’s not a perfect outing, not by a long shot, but above all it’s ultimately fun and hard to put down — in other words, the qualities you’d expect from a great gaming experience.\n\n\n\nScore\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nThe Final Word\n\n\n\nEnslaved is sci-fi road adventure featuring a captivating story that spans the fears of a world gone crazy with technology. Despite some mediocre gameplay elements, this game is hard to put down, and you will want to play it all the way through to see how it ends.\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\nhtml PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd""\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nThe Sinking City Visual Storytelling Featurette Released\n\n\n\nJohn-Paul Jones / September 13, 2018\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest video featurette from developer Frogwares on its newest game The Sinking City, as it explains how the visuals support the madness.\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\nhtml PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd""\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nBattlefield V Character Customization Will Be More Authentic Following Fan Feedback\n\n\n\nChante Williamson / September 13, 2018\n\n\n\nSince the unveiling of Battlefield V earlier this year, fans have been in dispute about the authenticity of of some …\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\nhtml PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd""\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nPixelJunk Monsters 2 Update 1.03 Patch Notes Confirm New Weekly Stages\n\n\n\nSimon Sayers / September 13, 2018\n\n\n\nTower defense game PixelJunk Monsters 2 is getting a major patch today.

At least, that's the short version of the story. Over the years, budgets haven't so much escalated as jettisoned into outer space. Graphics are shinier, overwrought orchestrations have replaced the bleeps and bloops of yore and a fundamental misunderstanding of story-telling in the digital world means that, for every Shadow of Colossus or Grand Theft Auto, dozens upon dozens of otherwise perfectly adequate gaming ventures buckle under the weight of bloated exposition and delirious melodramatics.\n\n\n\nEnter Enslaved , product of British developer Ninja Theory who was previously responsible for PlayStation exclusive Heavenly Sword - a pretty, well-presented action adventure that, despite rather wonky pacing and a cringe-worthy script, dazzled with its cinematic ambitions. As a piece of spectacle it was impressive; as an actual game, significantly less so. When news broke that Enslaved would feature the directorial, acting and motion-capture talents of Andy Serkis, with scribing duties going to Alex Garland of 28 Days Later and Sunshine, it was hard not to wonder if Ninja Theory would fall into the same presentation-obsessed trap a second time.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, as with Heavenly Sword, Ninja Theory has crafted an experience with sky-high production values. Its imaginative locales are rich in detail, painstaking animation infuses life into its genuinely likable cast of characters and it's all topped off with a sumptuously evocative, sparing score from Nitin Sawhney. What's more, Enslaved's remarkably uncluttered story sweeps events along at a genuinely captivating pace.\n\n\n\nSet 150 years into the future, mankind is all but extinct save a handful of human colonies battling against the world's only other inhabitants: mechanoids intent on enslaving humanity's few remaining survivors. Players step into the shoes of Monkey, a loner who's spent his life running from the robotic plague. At the outset of the game, Monkey's a prisoner onboard a slave ship but the actions of Trip - a technically savvy if otherwise timid fellow captive - enable him to engineer a clumsy escape. The pair soon crash among the desolate ruins of New York and, while unconscious, Trip fits Monkey with a slaver's headband, enabling her to administer pain and eventual death if Monkey refuses to help Trip reach her home beyond the city limits.\n\n\n\nIt's a tale that takes the duo through a range of familiar if fantastically-designed locations - from the foliage-strewn streets of crumbling New York to the windswept vistas of Trip's mountain top home - and a game that, unusually, crafts its environments to serve its story rather than for arbitrary diversity. It's a restrained approach that trickles down to its sparing exposition and believable dialogue. Even as very game-like events occur around Trip and Monkey, they react in perfectly believable ways and it all makes for a compelling, occasionally touching, adventure.\n\n\n\nAs a game though Enslaved isn't quite such a resounding success, combining basic platform acrobatics with pared-down melee combat and simplistic shooting. Individually, these elements range from the competent to the occasionally infuriating. Melee combat utilises the familiar two-button attack formula, doling out either wide sweeps of your energy-charged staff, ideal for bringing down multiple opponents in a tight space, or direct one-on-one pelts. By collecting energy orbs dotted around levels, you've access to a limited number of attack augmentations.

Looking back at the studio’s previous effort, Heavenly Sword, the similarities between that outing’s heroine Nariko and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West’s Trip are unmistakable: both have scarlet hair that hangs over their faces in tendrils, both have beautiful, expressive faces, and both kick ass – wait a minute, no, that’s not right. Trip’s a downright wuss. Actually, that’s what we like about her. She’s an interesting take on the damsel in distress: instead of getting into trouble and calling for help, she plans ahead by knowing she’ll get into dangerous situations and so forces the nearest muscle-bound meathead into protecting her.\n\n\n\nAbove: For a meathead, he\'s actually a big sweetie\n\n\n\nThis scenario, and the game in general, is inspired by the old Chinese myth Journey to the West. In that story, the character that inspired Trip is actually a male monk who commands the mystical Monkey King with a magic headband. In Enslaved, all magic is replaced with technology because the setting is post-apocalypse. The Monkey in the story is named just that – Monkey. He claims he doesn’t have a name, but that the people he trades with call him Monkey, and once the player takes control of him, the reason for his name becomes obvious: he climbs like a monkey, he hunches over in primate fashion, he’s always barefoot, and the sash hanging from his belt looks like a tail once he gets moving.\n\n\n\nAfter playing through Enslaved we went back to look at Heavenly Sword, and other than the aforementioned affinity for redheads, another thing becomes evident: Ninja Theory wants to be the storytelling game studio. Or possibly, the ambitions are higher: to push storytelling in all videogames forward. Whether that is the developer’s ambition or not, they have achieved it. Heavenly Sword accomplished a new standard in cutscenes by putting the acting, motion capture (especially facial expressions), and dialogue of other games to shame. The characters in the cutscenes felt like real actors in a real movie, displaying quirks and personality in a way that possibly no other game has.\n\n\n\nAbove: This ain\'t no dusty, irradiated wasteland\n\n\n\nThat is, until Enslaved came along. Comparing the story elements of Heavenly Sword and Enslaved on their surface might make Enslaved appear as a step backward, since the dialogue is more understated and the characters less flamboyant. Yet what Enslaved represents is a more mature approach to storytelling, and by being more subtle (and even ambiguous in many of its character’s reactions to each other) it develops quite an emotional payoff. Need a game to justify the gaming medium as legitimate for storytelling? Look no further.\n\n\n\nThe difficult part is talking about how the story is strong without ruining it, so we won’t give away any plot points or big reveals. Besides, the game shows right off the bat it means business in a spectacular first level. Something about Monkey is immediately likeable – he has the expectedly gruff voice (done brilliantly by Gollum himself, Andy Serkis), but it doesn’t sound like he’s gargling pebbles in a phony attempt to sound manly. There’s a tinge of softness to him, a slight vulnerability in his eyes, even when he’s pissed off. As he escapes the slave ship a series of harrowing close calls occur and we see that not only will the characters be engaging, but the action will break expectations.\n\n\n\nWe enjoyed Enslaved’s combat quite a bit, but it’s not a complex affair and people hoping for God of War (or Castlevania: Lords of Shadow) levels of combos and special moves might be disappointed. Enslaved aims for tactical combat, so it’s a bit more methodical. Monkey uses his fists and expanding lightsaber-ish staff to beat the piss out of various mechs, and he does it with panache, but the combos are simple – mash either the light or heavy attacks, but there aren’t air-juggles or tons of combos to unlock. Still, Monkey can dodge-roll, block and counterattack, perform wide group-clearing attacks and charge up stun moves. It’s enough to keep the combat fun and tense, but this isn’t a hack-and-slasher. Combat is just one part of gameplay – the others being climging and exploration, along with a bit of sneaking around especially dangerous enemies (but it’s no shoehorned attempt at stealth gameplay – there are no instant lose scenarios if you’re caught).\n\n\n\nAbove: POW!\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\n\nGenre\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nA tactical action-adventure game, Enslaved centers on the relationship between the two main characters and challenges players to employ a mix of combat, strategy and environment traversal. The presentation is a bit rocky, looking somewhat unfinished, but the world with its lush overgrown apocalypse is unique and the writing, acting, and story development are nop-notch.\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\n\nXbox 360, PS3\n\n\n\nUS censor rating\n\n\n\nTeen\n\n\n\nUK censor rating\n\n\n\n16+\n\n\n\nRelease date\n\n\n\n5 October 2010 (US), 8 October 2010 (UK)\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nCurrent page:\n\n\n\nPage 1\n\n\n\nNext Page\n\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n\nSee comments\n\n\n\nWe recommend\n\n\n\nBy Zergnet\n\n\n\nLoad Comments\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n8 things to watch out for this week\n\n\n\nAbout Us - Who\'s on the GamesRadar+ team?\n\n\n\nGame Reviews\n\n\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n\n\nTV Reviews\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider review: ""Jump scares, human sacrifice, and a Lara that has straight up lost her sh*t""\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNoblechairs Hero gaming chair review: \'A solid chair for gaming AND office work\'\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nTurtle Beach Stealth 300 headset review: \'Great range of features for a reasonable price\'\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man review: “About as good as superhero gaming gets”\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nTwo Point Hospital review: ""A mini-universe of glee and medical mischief""\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nMandy review: ""A bloody, druggy, superbly crafted revenge thriller""\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nA Simple Favor review: ""A slick thriller that’s best enjoyed with a martini in hand""\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nFirst Man review: ""Gosling and especially Foy are out of this world""\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nA Star is Born review: ""Superb.

In fast succession, players encounter it all: platforming, melee combat, teamwork, vehicle and turret sequences, puzzles, stealth, shooting, and plot. This isn’t the most innovative game on the market, and it doesn’t do anything spectacularly well. But the developers made this entire smorgasbord of play styles flow into each other nicely, and virtually every aspect of Enslaved feels polished and competently constructed. More important, this title is just plain fun to play and hard to put down. In short, it’s definitely worth at least a playthrough.\n\n\n\nThe plot is a science-fiction take on the classic Chinese story Journey to the West, with some extra ideas cribbed from The World Without Us (a book by Alan Weisman, who envisions what Earth would be like without humanity and likes what he sees). As the game begins, it’s 150 years in the future. The protagonist, Monkey, is trapped on a spaceship as a slave when all hell breaks loose and the ship starts to crash. Monkey flees from his cell and makes his way to the ship’s escape pods. A fellow slave beats him to the last available pod, however, and Monkey clings to the outside as the pod ejects and plummets to the ground. It lands in New York City -- or what used to be New York, anyway. The skyscrapers are crumbling, and colorful, beautiful vegetation has grown around them. There are no people, and there are no hints as to what happened to cause this state of affairs.\n\n\n\nHaving miraculously survived the fall (his cartoonishly large muscles must have cushioned the blow), Monkey awakens from unconsciousness to find himself with Trip, the slave who&#146d beat him to the escape pod. She informs him that she put a slave collar on him while he was out. This means two things: she can control his mind whenever she wants to; and if she dies, he dies. He has no choice but to help her survive. After some initial bickering, during which Monkey vows to kill Trip as soon as the collar comes off, they set off to find what’s left of Trip’s old village, and the adventure begins.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nThe Shame of Your Gaming Backlog\n\n\n\nThe Endless Tragedy of Digital Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nIs The Division Afraid to Get Political?\n\n\n\nIs Gaming Addiction a Thing (And Why We Can’t Decide)\n\n\n\nWhy You Might Be a Game Glitch Snob\n\n\n\nHow Gaming Ruins Relationships (And Why It Should Stop)\n\n\n\nWhy Video Game Secrets Matter\n\n\n\nCan Non-Fans Enjoy Sports Games?\n\n\n\nLet\'s Trade Microtransactions for Unlockables\n\n\n\nThis Sequel Will Send You into a RAGE!\n\n\n\nWhere Should Nintendo’s Classics Go Next?\n\n\n\nHow Fortnite Became #1 (and PUBG Didn\'t)\n\n\n\nWhy Deadpool Is F%#king Awesomesauce\n\n\n\nWhy PUBG Is Screwing up Big Time\n\n\n\nHow Video Games Can Get You Arrested\n\n\n\nMore Special Features...\n\n\n\nHottest Stuff On CheatCC!\n\n\n\nTop 10 Coolest Ways to Game Without Consoles\n\n\n\nTop 10 Games You\'ll Love Wrasslin\' With\n\n\n\nTop 7 Most Memorable RPGs on PS4\n\n\n\nTop 7 Best Genderswapped Characters\n\n\n\nTop 5 Most Toxic Gaming Communities\n\n\n\n7 Amazing Open Worlds You Gotta Play in 2018\n\n\n\nTop 7 Greatest Gaming Sidekicks of All Time\n\n\n\nTop 5 Capcom Classics That Need a Revival\n\n\n\nTop 10 Amazing Spider-Man Games\n\n\n\nTop 10 Uncanny X-Men Games\n\n\n\n10 Reasons This Is the Greatest Gaming Generation\n\n\n\nTop 7 Fantastic Fan Films Gamers Gotta See\n\n\n\nMuch of the gameplay time is spent simply traversing the terrain in an almost perfectly linear manner. There’s a fair amount of Uncharted-style platforming, but these sections exist more to occupy you than to challenge you. Monkey springs from one handhold, pole, or ledge to another with the simple push of a button, and he’ll refuse to jump if you try to leap in the wrong direction. Every once in a while, you’ll have to carry Trip through some hazards, or toss her to a ledge she can’t reach on her own, or create a bridge for her to cross. The only way to die while platforming is by failing to jump quickly enough when something you’re standing on starts to fall.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the exploration is broken up by battles against the lethal mechs that now inhabit New York. By combining a few simple mechanics in an interesting way, the developers made these fights feel unique, even though there’s really nothing about them that hasn’t been done before, and better.\n\n\n\nEarly in the game, Trip, who’s a technical whiz, wires a dragonfly to act as a spy camera. Using the dragonfly, she checks out each group of mechs before you fight them. Most mechs are dormant to begin with, and the dragonfly clearly indicates how far each mech can see. Sometimes, there’s room enough that you can sneak past the mechs without even battling them, giving Enslaved a small helping of stealth.\n\n\n\nMost of the time, however, you have to fight. Your weapon of choice is your staff, which can be used both to strike your enemies with light and heavy attacks, and as a gun that shoots plasma and stun rays. You also have a shield and can evade attacks. The fights can feel like button-mashing sessions sometimes, and some control issues get in the way (the long animations make it difficult to time your button presses), but they do a decent job of blending mindless fun with some light strategy.\n\n\n\nPage 1\n\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n\nPreview\n\n\n\nScreenshots / Images\n\n\n\nSlideshow\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS PAGE\n\n\n\n<![endif]–>\n\n\n\nAROUND THE WEB\n\n\n\nBest New Stuff on CheatCC\n\n\n\nCheatCC\'s Exclusive Assassin\'s Creed: Odyssey Interview\n\n\n\nLogitech 4K Pro Webcam Will Make You Look Good\n\n\n\nCan Rating Warnings Go Too Far?\n\n\n\nAre Companies Doing Enough to Keep Gamers Safe?\n\n\n\nTop 5 Women Who Shaped Nerd Culture\n\n\n\nWhy Does Fighting Game DLC Get Such a Bad Rap?\n\n\n\nShould Games Keep It Short N\' Sweet?\n\n\n\nIs Sharing Always Caring in Video Games?\n\n\n\nAre Some Fans Already Rejecting Cyberpunk 2077?\n\n\n\n7 Comic Characters That Deserve Games\n\n\n\nWhy Japan Needs More Adults-Only Games\n\n\n\nDo Games Have the Power to Change North Korea?\n\n\n\nIs Microsoft Forcing the Industry Forward?\n\n\n\nWhy We Still Love Metroidvanias\n\n\n\n10 Super Weird Appearances of Super Mario\n\n\n\nMore Special Features...\n\n\n\nTHE WEEKLY POLL\n\n\n\nWhich game is master of the Battle Royale genre?\n\n\n\nPUBG\n\n\n\nFortnite\n\n\n\nH1Z1\n\n\n\nFuture release (like Black Ops 4)\n\n\n\nView Poll History\n\n\n\nAlso Worth Reading!\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nWhy VR Will Never Overtake Traditional Gaming\n\n\n\nAre Fortnite Coaches a Big Deal?\n\n\n\nIs the Game of the Year Discussion Already Over?\n\n\n\nWill Halo Infinite Take Halo Back to the Top?\n\n\n\nThe Battle of the Kart Racers Is About to Begin\n\n\n\nIntellivision Returns to Us (At Just the Right Moment)\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n""Like"" CheatCC on Facebook\n\n\n\nFollow @cheatcc\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nSwitch\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nVita\n\n\n\nWii\n\n\n\nDS\n\n\n\nPS2\n\n\n\nOther Systems\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nGameCube\n\n\n\nPSOne\n\n\n\nN64\n\n\n\nGBA\n\n\n\nGame Boy\n\n\n\nDreamcast\n\n\n\nDVD\n\n\n\nVideos | Podcasts | Special Features | Game News | Advertise With Us | Contact Us\n\n\n\nTop Stories\n\n\n\nSteam Now Selling Uncensored Adult Games PUBG Drops to Under One Million Players Nintendo Announces Nintendo Switch Pokemon Bundles Breaking Down the Best of Sony’s Pre-TGS Announcements Get a Look at COD: Black Ops 4 Blackout\'s Map and Gameplay Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition Jumps to Consoles More News...\n\n\n\nCopyright © 1997-2018 Cheat Code Central.

That would be a very costly mistake for your family\'s future and for the other stakeholders of your entity; everyone similarly situated regrets it.\n\n\n\nThe world\'s best companies and smartest professionals always rely on DomainMarket.com and our super-premium, contextual .Com domains to leverage their branding opportunities. 500 out of 500 of the \'Fortune 500\' corporations use .Com, and all of the world\'s best salespeople and marketers; they aren’t going anywhere.\n\n\n\nDozens of others could use your trade name or trademark in a variety of industries, but only one of you can be smart enough to control the .Com customer traffic forever. If you don\'t own the exact match .Com premium domain best suited for your offerings then over time your brand and site is likely to get lost in Google and in the minds of potential customers; rendered irrelevant. Plus, it would be super embarassing and costly for your customers or prospects to land on this site when they are actually looking to purchase from you instead.\n\n\n\nPlus you may be able to profit from the consumer traffic, ""eyeballs"", and sell advertising space or use Google AdWords on the domain site, to your financial advantage. Our partner SEO.com are a team of world class digital marketing experts and select Google Partners. We recommend you contact them for any assistance with online advertising, marketing, SEO, PPC, landing page optimization, ecommerce, conversion optimization, web design, Facebook ads and more.\n\n\n\nSuper premium .com domain names from DomainMarket.com are the start and top of the economic food chain, in order to create the best on and offline \'unicorn\' corporations. Pick the wrong domain and you deserve the consequences of your competitors rolling you. Next you need the rest of the best of modern digital marketing if you want to compete with serious players in your industry.\n\n\n\n""Ring.com [sold for $1B] was previously called DoorBot, His tenacity, and the decision to stick with the product he originally built [but with better domain], has paid off in a big way.""\n\n\n\nAlmost all decent TV ads now use premium generic .Com too, and radio ads, plus sides of trucks, billboards, bumper stickers, boats, planes, tshirts, blogs, etc. You may be one of these \'Fortune 500\' mega corporations ready to dominate the world, or just a regular granny in your underwear, but either way you can look the same with XgpGaming.com.\n\n\n\nFirst come, first served. Don\'t miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to be #1. The first person or company to secure XgpGaming.com from this site can control it forever, to the exclusion of all others. It will become out of our control. Get it first; and get ranked first in Google! All that matters online is Location Location Location! Your Domain is Your Location! and brand, and future profits; dont shortchange it obviously! You can redirect your new domain traffic to your existing internet assets until you are done with development, or indefinitely, if you prefer.\n\n\n\nIt\'s critical to secure your domain today if you want to control the world class branding and recognition before your competitors who are eyeing it. They might outcompete you forever if they get it first and get all the traffic, conversions, and branding value compounded endlessly. A premium domain could easily add 20% compounding yearly to a company\'s bottom line profits if deployed properly, which for most companies would prevent them from going out of business.\n\n\n\nThis domain is offered for sale by its owner currently at the ""buy it now"" price listed ""BIN"" Click here to purchase XgpGaming.com , but could be withdrawn at any time or its price potentially substantially raised. Also, once sold, the next owner, your domain competitor, would likely never re-sell it again, especially to his competitor; and would instead try to take all your customers and potential customers, year after year, to the extent possible, which you should do to them by purchasing the domain first.\n\n\n\nYou may find a Make Offer button on certain higher value domains; but beware, expressing demand in a domain or visiting a URL usually raises its price. You can buy at the current price at any time, as long as you are first, and its still being offered for sale. The issue to recognize is that the current price naturally trends upwards over time, then additionally based on traffic, expressed interest, and other apparent demand. So time is of the essence, especially right now, with prices escalating precipitously.\n\n\n\nWould you seriously consider letting someone else control your best possible name, Internet branding, and Google positioning forever if you could avoid it? You can control it right now. There is extreme marketing power behind the perfect domain to promote your products and services. Owning a popular English expression and brand online is the Holy Grail for perpetually converting lower cost new customers.\n\n\n\nSuper premium domains from our marketplace generally rise in resale value, and can be reused or resold at any price if you are ever done capitalizing on them, or if you are a domain investor. Sales prices at our market have doubled over the last few years, and likely will again due to worldwide Internet growth, prestige, the general scarcity of super premium .Com domains, historically high demand, and the failure of all competing ""gTLDs"". We have been in business for over 10 years and have sold more of our premium domains than any of our competitors. At our previous company (BuyDomains.com) we launched the whole online premium domain trading industry in 1998.\n\n\n\nWaiting to purchase your favorite domain is a financial mistake, or, even worse, you may never be able to get it at all, at any price, if someone buys it first. It\'s much less risky to purchase a super premium domain and name your business accordingly, than any other choices; or at least redirect the free customer traffic to your site. Why would anyone choose to increase their business risks with inferior branding and domains? The ever increasing demand for internet sourced information and services, and premium domain investments is the very bandwagon you need to hop on. The trend is your friend! You may own all the tradenames, trademarks, logos, and social sites in the world, but exact match .Com possession ranking in Google is ten tenths of marketing/branding \'law\'.\n\n\n\nYou need to control the keywords and keyword combination strings relevant to your company and industry, forever if possible; bidding on words and paying over and over for advertising is a considerable risk, but buying the .Com is a certainty. The perfect domain, without compromising yourself and your brand, has to come first for a serious business, in order to set yourself apart from all wannabe competitors, and create long term leverage with your other communications and potential advertising. If you pick this domain you may not need expensive, super risky advertising at all, or at least not as much.\n\n\n\nIf the value of one new lifelong customer and its references makes up for the domain cost, imagine how a great domain from DomainMarket.com will benefit when it helps you attract multitudes of unexpected new customers (whose value far surpasses the rising domain investment). Google the Microsoft study proving this phenomenon: ""Domain Bias in Web Search""\n\n\n\nYou also need properly branded professional email if you want to appear professional and convert the highest number of customers at the highest profits. Using Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, AOL, instead of your own properly branded email address is foolish and unprofessional and fails to add leverage to your brand, or use the leverage from your brand, which should have been professionally built from day one. But no time like the present.\n\n\n\nPremium domains will keep going up in price due to a ""flight to quality"", millions of global companies, people and projects requiring great branding perpetually. Domain names lower in branding quality than the Super Premium .Com level DomainMarket.com specializes in are far too risky to be considered investments, like all the new “gTLD” domains, or very low level .Coms. They are hobbies at best and more likely just a complete waste. But the right .Com is the ideal investment and marketing vehicle for anyone with ambition.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of ambition; your boss and coworkers will love you; and you may just get a raise, if you improve the URL, email addresses and branding for everyone, forever. Anybody who might have told you that .Com domains would go away, lose value, be replaced by other domain extensions or technologies was totally wrong, or worse.\n\n\n\nIn some cases a premium domain can be effective in helping with your tax strategy too (please ask your accountant for details); or can work as an alternative asset (like Bitcoin), a way to store investment value in ""the cloud"" forever, that is easy, anonymous, and cheap to control and move around (ask a pro).\n\n\n\nEach domain in our marketplace is individually valued based on a series of attributes, developed by professionals for over two decades. We are the primary dealer for every single fabulous .Com domain listed on our site. Any other legitimate sellers are secondary.\n\n\n\nA delayed costly escrow process is not necessary to complete your transaction, as we have been the trusted dealer for tens of thousands of domain transactions and transfers, without a glitch. DomainMarket.com is the best known and most trusted competitor in the premium domain name industry. In any event, if it makes you feel even more comfortable, Escrow.com is a purchase option for large transactions.\n\n\n\nThe asking price for XgpGaming.com is based on a careful and professional appraisal by the world\'s leading experts on domain valuations, the inventors of ecommerce for premium domains. The price is explicitly certified to be fair by real experts, so the buyer can be confident in the great long-term value and investment opportunity for the unique domain asset in question.\n\n\n\nYour competition for a great domain, and therefore your opportunity to arbitrage or capitalize, is even greater than your normal business competition, because it includes your normal competition, plus any other company or person in the world that wants to invest in domains for the future, plus anyone who competes for the same word, expression, or brand in any marketing or media.\n\n\n\nFor example if you are a lighting manufacturer competing for the domain \'BrightFuture.com\' then all the educational institutions or websites in the world could become your competitor for domains, or partner potentially; or you could sell it to them at a huge profit if you are a good investor. Not to mention any religious institution would be well served with that domain.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve ever been to a competitor’s marketplace you will find predominantly random, worthless domains, at prices that were derived without any logical appraisal process. But our domain appraisals and prices are very consistent with one another, regardless whether you appreciate any particular one. Competitors collections and sites with domain names for sale are unappraised mostly, inconsistent if they are priced, and are not done by true professionals oftentimes. Conversely, DomainMarket.com\'s for sale inventory is highly curated and cleaned for excellence, with proper pricing.\n\n\n\nSuper-premium domain values generally range from $10,000 to $2 million. The average industry sales price is approximately $30,000. Our marketplace also has thousands of “close out” domains, at even lower prices!\n\n\n\nBuilding a fabulous online presence starts with a top-quality domain name from DomainMarket.com. Here, you\'ll find only the very best .Com domain names waiting to be developed into first-rate profitable brands.\n\n\n\nDomains are valued based on many factors such as marketability and brand-ability, the industry it is related to, similar domain sales, acquisition cost and, if applicable, the website traffic and associated revenue they can drive. A strong domain is one of the best investments you can make in your business, and can pay for itself many times over.\n\n\n\nExact match domains from DomainMarket.com dramatically reduce the amount companies pay per click by improving their Quality Scores, the measure by which Google determines a keyword\'s relevance and cost. Your domain\'s Quality Score depends on alignment between the paid keyword, ad copy and landing page or website. The more a search query appears in an ad, including in the domain name/display URL, the more relevant the ad appears to the searcher.\n\n\n\nWe are also search engine optimization (SEO) experts, and own SEO.com Inc. corporation with 40 employees. Let us know if you need help getting paid or organic traffic; help in getting to the top of Google.\n\n\n\nWhy XgpGaming.com? Print\n\n\n\nGreat brand recognition and memorability from advertising, marketing, and your web site landing pages.\n\n\n\nThis domain is likely to hold and increase its value over time. Poor domain names lose traffic and new customer conversions to better domain named companies, Microsoft Research calls this effect ""domain bias in web search."" XgpGaming.com is a category killer domain that may be commonly used around the world. Such a name offers your company a clear competitive advantage online and off.\n\n\n\nXgpGaming.com is relatively easy to spell / highly memorable. Trust and recognition from such a great name drives higher click through rates. Only one person or entity can have it and utilize it online and offline for marketing and advertising (and maintain all future resale rights at any price or profit level).\n\n\n\nEstablish your company, product or service dominance with an outstanding .Com brand. For existing brands, it is the ideal opportunity to re-enforce and protect your brand.\n\n\n\nMarketability\n\n\n\nThis is an exciting long term branding opportunity\n\n\n\nHistorically, exact match keywords have been rated higher in relevancy for search engine ranking. A super-premium .Com domain name from DomainMarket.com comes at a much lower cost and with a higher long-term value than traditional advertising, which is a very risky sunk cost. Organic web traffic is a natural resource that can be acquired by the domain name owner. These domains for sale are great long-term asset investments, with an advertising annuity value to boot.\n\n\n\nAsk us about Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Marketing, and Web Development, with our partner SEO.com ; and VOIP phone services, APIs, and apps with Phone.com .\n\n\n\nRespectability\n\n\n\nThe right domain provides instant authority and perceived market credibility.

Perhaps we should expect this from Enslaved: Odyssey to the West , with The Beach and 28 Days Later author Alex Garland credited as co-writer and Heavenly Sword creators Ninja Theory on development duty. Even so, the wonderful artwork, emotive characters and gloriously colourful gameworld produce an adventure that’s involving and stunning, if perhaps at times a little disassociating and automated when it comes to the nuts and bolts of the actual gameplay.\n\n\n\nIt begins with a chance meeting. Hundreds of years in the future mankind has been ravaged by a great war leaving cities abandoned and patrolled by hostile robots – or ‘mechs’ – whilst pockets of human survivors are disparate and leaderless. Aboard a slave ship heading for the mysterious ‘Pyramid’, heroes Monkey and Trip happen upon one another and escape together as the damaged ship crashes to the ground, and when the unconscious Monkey later comes to, he finds Trip has enslaved him as she needs his help travelling home. What begins as a somewhat tense and cold partnership soon grows to a mutual friendship, with master and slave soon developing genuine affection and warmth for one another.\n\n\n\nThe plausibility of the plot and the characters is helped exponentially by the quality of the character visuals and performances. Of particular note are the faces, which are incredibly expressive and really convey emotions convincingly, even aside from the script. Likewise, this visually stunning interpretation of a colourful and vegetative post-apocalyptic world feels unique and certainly makes Enslaved stand out from the gamut of brown and sombre post-war worlds that inhabit the sub-genre. The cutscenes are lavish, with motion-captured performances by the main cast, and while the yarn it spins may not quite be an odyssey, it’s certainly an interesting journey across its fourteen levels, with a strong finale and an interesting twist at the end.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay inhabits a world somewhere between Uncharted and Batman: Arkham Asylum , with platforming and Monkey clambering around like his simian namesake, mixed with combat against groups of increasingly resilient enemies. Monkey wields a staff and initially can only perform a small handful of basic combos and strikes, although this can soon be built up as Monkey ‘buys’ more combat options from Trip, including extra health, a stronger blocking shield and new offensive moves. Nonetheless, even when Monkey is fully upgraded, there aren’t too many attacks or combos, and the fights never seem to flow as smoothly or satisfyingly as those in comparative action-adventures.\n\n\n\nIf the combat lacks depth, then it’s probably fair to say that the platforming is basically perfunctory – bordering on being fully automated, only certain ledges can be climbed up, handholds shimmer so they can’t be missed and it’s actually impossible for Monkey to fall to his death, or jump from ledges unless programmed so. That’s not to say that swinging around poles or smoothly running up a drainpipe isn’t great to watch and fairly exhilarating, but the fact all challenge has been removed leaves it feeling akin to going through the motions rather than having any real sense of tangible input – if you point Monkey in broadly the correct direction and press X, he’ll get to where he needs to be.\n\n\n\nThe camera takes a traditional third-person stance, mapped to the right analogue stick, which generally works well and allows the player to carefully scan the environment. The camera tends to be well behaved, although it does sometimes back off to a fixed viewpoint which isn’t always particularly helpful. It generally feels a bit too close to Monkey though, and this can cause issues during combat where you’ll often be attacked by an enemy off-screen against whom you had almost no chance of evading or defending. It also gets trapped and jerky around scenery during interior sections which is problematic during the final sections of the game where there are a lot of indoor battles.\n\n\n\nThere are also some sections where Monkey has to use his ‘Cloud’ hover board to get through an impassable section and find a way for Trip to proceed. This usually involves whizzing around the environment to destroy an obstacle or forge a path forward, and they make a nice change of pace, even if the Cloud itself is a little contrived as you can only use it in specific areas. It’s also used in a couple of chase sequences where Monkey has to pursue and bring down enemies, and these again provide a welcome change of pace as well as being some of the most exciting set-pieces in the game. Monkey’s staff can also be used to shoot stun and plasma projectiles, and often he has to stick to cover whilst shooting across distances at mechs, which while hardly Gears of War is satisfying and helps keep the gameplay varied.\n\n\n\nEnslaved is built using the Unreal Engine 3, even if its proliferation of colour wouldn’t make you think that. The visuals are sumptuously detailed and the vistas broad and imaginative, although as a result there are some performance issues – such as screen tearing when you move the camera around, slow-loading textures during cutscenes and occasional frame rate drops. However, there’s very little which actually affects the gameplay itself, no matter how disconcerting it is when objects take two seconds for detail to pop in mid-cutscene. The characters are extremely detailed and well animated on the whole and the level of imagination and artwork that has gone into the design of this wasteland is far more imaginative than most products of the same premise. This is without question one of the game’s crowning achievements.\n\n\n\nEnslaved is more than the sum of its parts, because despite its flaws and issues it’s still a fun game to play, and presents a fantastic big-budget adventure in a wonderfully unique gameworld inhabited by superbly realised characters. The whole production feels like it could do with a little more depth – outside of the narrative, it feels like there’s nothing going on below the surface – but this is still a fun, awe-inspiring and lavish eight hours of game that delivers plenty of its own style and flavour and is a fine addition to a busy genre.\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nout of\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nSharing is caring\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nThe author of this fine article\n\n\n\nTerence Gage is a Senior Staff Writer at Thunderbolt, having joined in April 2007.\n\n\n\nRecommended reading\n\n\n\nPS3 Review\n\n\n\nby James Dewitt\n\n\n\nThe Walking Dead: Season Two Episode 1 – All That Remains\n\n\n\nPS3 Review\n\n\n\nby James Dewitt\n\n\n\nDustforce\n\n\n\nPS Vita, PS3 Review\n\n\n\nby James Dewitt\n\n\n\nDuke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition\n\n\n\nPS3 Review\n\n\n\nby Sean Kelley\n\n\n\nSuper Mega Baseball\n\n\n\nPS3 Review\n\n\n\nby James Dewitt\n\n\n\nBorderlands: The Pre-Sequel\n\n\n\nBorderlands\n\n\n\nPS3 Review\n\n\n\nby Simon Holmes\n\n\n\nDark Souls 2: Crown of the Sunken King\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto\n\n\n\nCall of Duty\n\n\n\nFIFA\n\n\n\nBattlefield\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nRetail\n\n\n\nGentle persuasion\n\n\n\nYou should like us on Facebook .\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nPreviews\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nForum\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nPS Vita\n\n\n\niPhone\n\n\n\niPad\n\n\n\nWebsite designed by Philip Morton and hosted by WebFaction .\n\n\n\n© Thunderbolt 2000-2018.

The series has undergone improvements annually, yet it still somehow manages to take a backseat to the underwhelming but ever popular NBA Live games, which can be largely attributed to the attention-grabbing EA Sports logo emblazoned on the cover. All that aside, though, 2K7 is still the thoroughbred as far as basketball games go, boasting deeper controls, dramatic visuals, and a few other marked improvements over the previous installment.\n\n\n\nThe features in 2K7 are what you would come to expect from a 2K game. The crux of the action is found in The Association, where you must juggle the tasks of playing the role of General Manager while also getting the job done on the court. There are plenty of accomplishments to be made, which can then be viewed in your crib's trophy case. This mode covers multiple seasons and isn't particularly different from past installments. You'll spend much of your time on the court, but there are many managerial duties to be done between games and during the postseason. If certain team needs aren't met, you very likely could become an unemployed GM.\n\n\n\nOn the flipside, there's also 24/7 mode, which is the street-ball equivalent to The Association, so to speak. You start out as a fledgling baller without any notoriety whatsoever, hoping to someday establish yourself amongst the game's elite. Before you embark on such a journey, however, you first have to create your player. The create-a-player features much of the stuff found in last year's version, but the amount of leeway and the level of precision found in the face creator is still remarkable. You can literally sculpt a face that's strikingly similar to your own in a matter of 10-20 minutes. Furthermore, all sorts of clothing and accessories are available. There is not much to complain about here. You can even use the system to fully edit and update current NBA stars. Your biggest problem likely will be deciding on which Air Forces to sport.\n\n\n\nOnce you inevitably beat Shaq in a free-throw shootout and form an identity for yourself, you are ready to build up your status. Unfortunately, as you continue on you'll come to realize that games are reduced to mere back-and-forth offensive showings with little-to-no form of defense. And although you change teammates quite frequently and compete in various two-on-two's, three-on-three's, and so on, these games quickly grow stale. It's also worth noting that the defensive artificial intelligence isn't necessarily top notch--fortunately, it's much better in the regular season games--and this hinders the game's street mode. Opponents lack that hunger and aggression you would come to expect. While it's a help to your team, it's tough watching the computer avoid enormous alleys to the hoop and pass up wide-open jumpers. The opponent AI does stiffen up as you get further along. But it would've been nice if they exhibited more intensity from the start. Other than these two core modes, rounding off the list of available play types are season, street, practice, tournament, and situation.\n\n\n\nThose familiar with 2K basketball will be fairly acclimated with the way 2K7 plays. It's a by-the-books type adaptation of the NBA league, and it does a formidable job recreating a true-to-TV presentation. Players are encouraged to make the extra pass and take wise shots, especially since the AI here is more equipped. Defenders cover their gaps and lanes well for the most part, although occasionally you'll frown at your teammates' lack of defensive effort on fast-breaks. That aside, they cover the floor well and respond concisely to various offensive and defensive play calls. Driving to the lane is effective to some degree, but the play calling is an integral part of play. Visual Concepts hammers down real-life strategies and compels you to make use of them. Spreading the ball around until you hit the open player is key, because the trajectory of your shot is a direct reflection of your shot release, the space between your nearest defender, and your shooting ability. Find the open teammate and--swish!--he'll likely knock down the bucket if he's a reasonably accurate shooter. Even if the shot happens to rim out, though, you're still setting yourself up for high-percentage shots and a very feasible chance to win.\n\n\n\nWhile the game rests on its laurels, players will notice a number of additions that set this title above the competition, as well as previous installments. One great feature, dubbed ?On the Fly Coaching? by the developer, allows players to pull up various coaching screens with the directional pad during play. Each direction pulls up a designated menu. There's a play-calling menu, a substitution menu, and more. These flashy menus are easy to navigate and let players simultaneously coach and play without ever breaking the flow of the game. You can change defensive setups, substitute players, call offensive plays, and so on. It is a great way to try and dictate the pace of a game and take advantage of your particular team's style of play. Whether that is a fast paced, run-and-gun tempo or a more formal, half-court style is entirely up to you. Either way is equally satisfying. The default on-screen offensive and defensive plays cover your basic calls. But they can be interchanged with additional plays from the start menu, if you like. On the default setting the AI automatically substitutes players, though it's nice to be able to make your own substitutions, especially when managing players' fatigue levels.\n\n\n\nNBA 2K7 is accessible to newcomers, but to truly appreciate the game, you must learn all the specific moves it has to offer. The face buttons still cover different passes and shooting, but you will often find yourself using the right stick, which subsumes many of the game's prominent functions. On offense the right analog initiates various dunks, lay-ups, and post-up moves, as well as your basic jump shot. For the casual player, the stick may seem to simply initiate a random animation. But the right stick actually evokes specific animations, depending on which direction you press. Pressing the stick up, for example, initiates a finger roll, while pressing the stick down calls for a tear drop. Press the stick by itself to perform lay-ups, or you can repeat the process while holding the right trigger for dunks. You can make the distinction of whether or not to take a hook shot or a fade-away jumper when looking to post up the defender, and better yet, you can specifically try to bank your shots off the backboard. The choice is really up to you. Naturally, the league's bigger, less athletic players are better suited for power dunks, while the more agile players have a knack for the fancier, more dazzling finishes. Either way, taking the ball to the paint and finishing the play is satisfying to watch. Players just have to be aware of the context of each shot, which can make the difference between a prayer of a shot and a beautifully executed finish.\n\n\n\nAs for finding the open lane, players can use a number of quick-burst crossovers and jukes to elude the defense, although holding various combinations of the left and right triggers, while stringing together multiple directions on the left stick, is easier said than done. Actually, the number of button combinations could rival that of some fighting games, yet they fail to measure up in consistency. For what it's worth, you have a varied arsenal of jukes at your disposal, but on the same token, it's somewhat uninviting for the player who just wants to pick up the controller and jump right into the mix, especially when the said jukes aren't entirely reliable.\n\n\n\nThe right analog plays an important role on defense too. Again, pressing the stick in different directions initiates various defensive stances and moves. If you pull the stick away from the defender, you'll put your hands in the air. The remaining directions let you make a cutoff move, go for the steal, swat block, etc. Considering the vast number of moves on both sides of the ball, newcomers to the series may have a hard time coming to grips with all these specifics, as it's understandably a lot to digest. Of course, casual players can very well pick up the controls and manage to put up a decent performance. Knowing how to pull off the more demanding moves can take time. And fortunately the pay off is worth the effort for those who do end up investing the time.\n\n\n\nBeing able to utilize so many offensive and defensive moves is not only a much- appreciated inclusion, it also lets the game flex its main selling point: signature style. Every player was motion captured and the results are unbelievable. With this, you see the likenesses of each NBA player come to life right on the screen. Shawn Marion's obscure way of shooting is there; Duncan's turn-around hook shot is there. However, it's not only the shots that are authentic, it's everything--the way they run, the way they dribble. Think of any player and the way he moves about and shoots the ball and its there, rendered to near perfection. The game's also robust with small nuances and intricacies. Players without the ball fight for position; cameramen stand courtside taping all the action; coaches and players that occupy the bench fervently watch from the sideline. It's really a sight to see, since just as much is going on courtside as there is in the actual game. It is also worth noting how the home team mascot and cheerleaders vivaciously parade onto the court during intermissions to entertain the crowd. Not enough can be said about the realistic animations, both with how they accurately represent players' real-life tendencies and with how they all mesh together so naturally. The end result is a game that's overflowing with liveliness no matter where your attention may be on the court.\n\n\n\nThe visuals are impressive in standard definition but still pale in comparison to a high-def setup. The visuals hit their low points with street mode's unpolished textures, but the graphics are top notch otherwise. Everything from the crisp menus to the lush arenas has more detail, with near-perfect player models. At the free throw line, you see their uniforms subtly dangling from their bodies. Then the camera angle changes to an up-close view, with convincing beads of sweat pouring down players' faces. Also, the lighting from arenas vibrantly reflects off players, displaying their chiseled arms and detailed tattoos. The faces strikingly mirror their real-life counterparts, and they animate well by conveying various facial expressions. Watching players miss a shot only to scowl at their inaccuracy is just as much eye candy as seeing them celebrate after a positive play. It's too bad, though, that player emotion doesn't necessarily take into account the context of the game. A player whose team is on the verge of getting blown out shouldn't celebrate as much as he does after a made basket. But it's almost nitpicky to bring up such issues, considering how solid the presentation is as a whole.\n\n\n\nThe excellent presentation is due largely to the game's graphical prowess. But even so, it wouldn't be quite as exciting if not for the excellent audio. Craig Sager, Kenny Smith, and Kevin Harlan return from last year to cover the play-by-play commentary, and they do a commendable job. Kenny Smith even does a halftime segment to breakdown the first two quarters. Meanwhile, the enthusiasm from the fans delivers a genuine feel to the game and intensifies the mood. It is rejuvenating to dictate your crowd's involvement with your on-court performance. Going on a 10-0 run as the home team will surely have the locals in an uproar, while going on similar runs in an opponent's arena will inevitably evoke an equally pleasing silence from the disenchanted, disheartened fans. The soundtrack is strictly rap and provides a decent balance between well-known stars and underground artists. The more notable acts include Slim Thug, E-40, Fabolous, Lupe Fiasco, and Mos Def. While the lyrics are mostly geared toward the hardwood sport, there's a good degree of variation found in the tempos and rhythms, although some of the songs are less fitting than others.\n\n\n\nThe game has a lot to offer with its core modes alone, but to really get the most out of the title you'll want to take the action online to square off against the best. Aside from the usual ranked matches, players can set up their own leagues, create tournaments, and even play street ball. With a reliable connection, the controls and animations stay seamless. A lackluster connection on the other hand can really bog down the game, throwing off the timing of your shot release and just about every other conceivable facet of play.\n\n\n\nFor those interested, you can upload the custom highlight reels you may have made with the\n\n\n\n2K Reelmaker\n\n\n\n. And if you want to switch up the pace, you can always go to your crib and play a game of darts or air hockey, both of which keep score as you play. Navigating through all the wonderful features that 2K7 has to offer, both online and offline, tends to be a chore. The problem with the menu screen, which is toggled on and off by moving the right analogue stick, isn't in its design, but rather, in its lack of functionality. Once you make a selection from the menu, the screen subsequently disappears. When you pull it back up, you're back at the start. This may not seem too dire at first, but it's not long before you're forced to incessantly navigate the same subsets of menu screens. This is truer than ever when navigating the online menus. What Visual Concepts was thinking with this shoddy setup is beyond comprehension.\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nNBA 2K7 is a complete game that offers everything you would want in a basketball title. You'll spend countless hours in The Association and 24/7 modes alone, plus there's online compatibility and other areas to fool with. Seasoned veterans will greatly appreciate the authentic presentation and dynamic control system, with the ability to perform nearly any conceivable move, from your various hop steps to your head fakes to your stutter steps. That's not to say that the jukes could have been a bit more steadfast, though. And the developer should carefully rethink the irritating menu system. It's about time 2K Sports and Visual Concepts get their just due. After all, the two are only behind the most solid basketball title year after year, yet they still manage to make the game more enjoyable each time out.\n\n\n\nUser Comments\n\n\n\nSid Meier’s Civilization VI is Heading to Nintendo Switch This Holiday Season Capcom Beat ‘Em Up Bundle Arrives Next Week on Consoles and PC Cities: Skylines Can Now Be Played Everywhere On The Nintendo Switch Nintendo Labo: Vehicle Kit Now Available in Stores Shadow of the Tomb Raider Now Available From Eidos Montreal Final Fantasy VII, IX, X and More Are Headed to Xbox One Xbox Reveals New Game Pass Bundle Involving Forza Motorsport and Horizon Nintendo Direct Reveals New Animal Crossing, Luigi’s Mansion 3, and More Assassin’s Creed Odyssey Season Pass Gives You More Story and More Games WWE 2K19 Gameplay Trailer Released Along With Million Dollar Challenge Details\n\n\n\nHome • About Us • Contact Us • Advertise • Jobs • Privacy Policy • Site Map\n\n\n\nCopyright ©1999-2012 Matt Swider.

In combat, Monkey uses a staff that doubles as a close-combat and long-range projectile weapon. The staff has two types of long-range ammunition in the form of power cylinders: orange cylinders used for blast damage and blue cylinders used for stunning foes. Monkey can also remain stationary and charge his staff to use the same stun attack. In the game, players encounter numerous mechs as enemies. Certain mechs can be used as weapons.  Monkey can perform a finishing move on them when they are low on health, such as tearing the gun off a turret or throwing an explosive foe at other combat mechs. Monkey's other abilities include his force shield that can block a certain amount of damage before requiring a recharge, and the ""Cloud"" device that manifests as a hover board that can be used to glide across water or land at great speeds. When enemies are defeated, they drop tech orbs that can be used to upgrade Monkey's abilities. They allow the player to learn new moves and abilities for combat and devices, increase overall health and shields and the damage that can be inflicted on enemies. Orbs can be found littered across levels, sometimes hidden out of sight, requiring extra exploration at times. Another type of collectible players can amass is masks, which are also scattered across different levels.During the game Tripitaka, or simply ""Trip"", who must be escorted and protected as they travel, accompanies Monkey. He has a device attached to his head linked to Trip. This device, called a slave headband in the game, requires Monkey to keep Trip alive. Should she die he will as well. In some instances just going too far away from her can result in the same fate. Trip, however, can help Monkey overcome obstacles at times by performing certain actions involving her technical skills like hacking into a computer. Players can command Trip to use her different skills. For instance, she can scan the surrounding area revealing hazards such as land mines or mechs on standby, and project a temporary hologram as a decoy to draw the enemy's attention away from Monkey. Players can also order Trip to hide behind covers or regroup with Monkey. Having no combat ability of her own, Trip is vulnerable in instances where she is attacked by enemies. Her only defense is an electromagnetic propulsion blast, which she can use to stun enemies threatening her temporarily.Other than combat, the gameplay also focuses heavily on platforming where Monkey can scale and leap across the ruins throughout the game. Some areas and platforms will collapse shortly after use, requiring faster scaling before Monkey potentially falls to his death. Trip also plays a part in the platforming sections of the gameplay, making some sections of platforming akin to puzzle-like forms of gameplay. In other instances where Monkey can make jumps/climbs, Trip needs to be thrown to the other side or ride on his back. In some sections of the game Monkey and Trip are separated so the player cannot use her abilities.",Enslaved: Odyssey to the West,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enslaved:_Odyssey_to_the_West
65705,Tricky Towers,Xbox One,tricky towers,"['[\'tricky towers review ( xbox one ) - xboxaddict . com\', \'tetris is one of the most well - known games of all time . its classic gameplay is as simplistic as it gets , and it has spawned countless iterations and knock offs , all trying to slightly modify the gameplay just enough for it to be different and fresh . needless to say , when a tetris - like game releases , i usually don’t take much notice , as we’ve seen it all before . that’s what shocked me about tricky towers though , it actually did change things up just enough to be interesting and capture my attention .\', \'tricky towers is a byproduct of mashing up classic tetris and jenga . jenga is all about building your tower as high as you can without it toppling while managing the constant fight against gravity . in tricky towers , instead of standard jenga blocks you have the tetromino pieces we’ve come to expect from any tetris game . the idea is very simple but it works , so not only are you trying to interlock tetromino pieces , but you also need to be mindful of the weight and placement of each piece , as gravity is a factor in your game .\', ""tricky towers boasts itself as a multiplayer focused title , not something you see often in many smaller indie games , so it’s a very welcome addition . there is a single player component as well , should you want to relax and play at your own pace . the premise of tricky towers is simple : build up your tower and try and topple your opponent’s , or challenge yourself in the puzzle mode , attempting to use every piece you \' re given without tipping your tower over ."", ""naturally , i started to play tricky towers simply as a tetris clone , but there’s a few factors that differentiate itself as a simple knock off . the biggest mechanic you’ll need to become accustomed to is the movement of the pieces . in standard tetris , each piece is made up of a formation of 1x1 blocks to create its shape , and when you move left or right , your pieces move 1 block exactly . tricky towers has half movements , so when you tap left on the d - pad or the left stick , your piece will actually move half a block over . while this means you can make very precise and minor movements , you’re also going to make countless mistakes as you \' ll be slightly off when placing your pieces due to this . it’s not impossible to learn , but something you’ll constantly have to remember ."", \'there’s a decent amount of gameplay to be had , even when playing solo , as the game has 50 increasingly difficult levels to tackle in trial mode . there’s an endless mode to challenge you too , seeing how tall you can build your tower before it inevitably comes crashing down . puzzle , race , and survival modes are the three included modes that will each offer a slightly different experience with widely different strategies . single player is great if you’re just looking for a few minutes of gameplay , as completing a certain amount of levels will unlock the next tier of difficulty and more stages to complete .\', \'race mode is my personal favorite . this mode is simple in concept , as you simply need to beat your opponent to the finish line above . different strategies are completely viable here ; do you build slow and wide , making a sturdy base while slowly building upwards , or do you risk balancing pieces and soar towards the finish line , hoping your tower doesn’t come crashing down ? playing against the ai is one thing , but playing against another player makes it much more challenging and entertaining .\', \'to make things more interesting there are power - ups that you’ll gain from reaching certain threshold heights . these power - ups give you an option of being helpful to yourself , or detrimental against your opponent , so you need to quickly weigh which option is better in that certain moment . do you place an unmovable piece on your tower , creating an anchor - like base to build from , or do you use it against your opponent , causing one of his pieces grow 5 times in size , surely to make his tower crash . these moments are incredibly satisfying , especially once you see the chaos that ensues on your opponent’s tower .\', ""there’s more than a dozen different powers to use , each of which have a very specific strategy . as you get near the finish line you \' ll find the match becomes very chaotic , as you not only need to build your tower high enough to reach the finish , you also need your tower to be stable enough to cross and stay up for more than 3 seconds . do you take more time and build something structurally sound or risk it and hope that it’ll stand for a simple 3 seconds for the win ? using your power - ups at these times is a great way to start fights between friends !"", ""survival mode gives you a specific amount of bricks that need to be placed to win , but you only have three lives , which you lose each time a block falls into the abyss . the first few levels of survival aren \' t too bad , as you’re not racing against an opponent , so you can be more deliberate with your placements , but eventually these stages become very challenging . later levels eventually throw distractions at you , like smoke clouds that block your view , usually causing you to misplace your brick placement rather then putting it where you intended , or random pieces growing to 5 times the size , throwing off your perfect build . there are even survival stages later on where every piece is locked , preventing you from any rotating , so there’s plenty of challenge to be had in this mode ."", \'puzzle mode starts with a predefined platform , challenging you with placing every piece you’re given without any falling into the pit . oh , but the most difficult thing about this mode is that there’s a laser above the platform , so every piece played must not fall and touch the laser , or you lose . you’ll need to figure out how to interlock each piece just perfectly to complete these levels , for as far as i can tell , there’s only one solution to each of these puzzle levels . they are designed quite well , and you feel a sense of satisfaction when you finally figure out the exact placement of each piece , but expect to be stumped on specific levels for quite some time before you figure out the solution .\', \'lastly , there’s endless mode . here you can attempt to build your tower forever , but every 15 seconds or so a new wave occurs , applying a modifier in attempt to make your tower come crashing down . some of these modifiers will cause your blocks to fall incredibly fast , become huge pieces , lock the rotation and more . this mode is quite addictive , though a tough modifier will put your skills to the test .\', \'all of the modes can be played across multiplayer as well , locally or online , which was a shock to see included . up to 4 players can compete against one another , making for some chaotic gameplay . you’re able to choose your mode , difficulty , and number of rounds in a tournament . the only problem i found while playing online was that you have to completely back out to the main menu if you want to change the game mode or settings , prompting re - invites to all of your friends . lastly , and somewhat unfortunately , there’s absolutely no one playing this online , as i’ve been unable to find a single random game every time i’ve tried , so unless you plan on playing local couch co - op , don’t expect there to be a community online playing .\', \'i enjoyed seeing the online leaderboards , allowing one to see how they stack up against the competition . while the whole game is accessible , there are microtransactions in place in the form of skins for your pieces

tricky tower shines , causing some hilarity at the best of times , and anger directed towards your friends the other times . sure , you’ll get frustrated now and then , as it’s sometimes hard to recover from a misplaced block , but that’s where the challenge comes for this game . tricky tower is quite \' tricky \' to get the hang of , as it takes some time learning , and remembering , the ‘half’ moves the blocks make , and that these same blocks aren’t locked in place once they land . at the end of the day tricky towers can be an enjoyable experience , especially if you’re craving some tetris - like gameplay with a unique twist ."", \'fanso of focus home interactive’s sim - like driving game can look forward to new dlc this fall . click thru for details .\', \'check out all the dlc

mode only found on the console , but more on that later . with its challenging puzzle gameplay , the game has players use tetromino blocks to stack giant towers . unlike tetris however , tricky towers lets players place pieces in hectic and awkward ways , mostly due to the physics that affect them . these mechanics alone make this game far more difficult than i had expected when i first saw it . add to this that the entire experience takes on a sort of competitive feel , and you can see how the game would be an obvious choice for puzzle lovers that like to show their skill .', 'you may be wondering how you make stacking tetrominos competitive , but it’s actually quite simple . in any given mode , the player will be given blocks ( random or predetermined ) to twist and stack to reach a certain goal . this changes from mode to mode , but the big takeaway is to make your tower the way the game wants . sometimes this means making a tall stack , while other times it means making the shortest or sturdiest .', 'no matter the case , players will often need to keep in mind one other thing : magic . whether light or dark , magic can completely change a match . some of the effects the magic can have include tying blocks together with vines , covering pieces in shrubs that conceal them , destroying the last tetrimino placed , and embiggening the brick being placed .', 'there are three modes to keep in mind , each with their own ways to win . there’s race , survival , and puzzle , all of which can be played either alone or in multiplayer . in single player , these modes are available in trials and endless trials variations . in race , the player will have to reach a certain height requirement in the given time , often being harassed by an opposing mage . the endless version of this is the unique game mode found only in the xbox release , which simply has players race against an ever rising fail line in order to see how high they can stack their tower .', 'survival requires careful planning and quick wit as the player creates a tower without losing any blocks . for each block ( or group of them ) lost , a heart is taken away . with only three hearts , it’s easy to see how the trials version ( opposing mage ) and endless trials version ( no mage ) can become difficult in a short time . finally , there’s the puzzle mode that gives the player a unique base to build off of while staying below the laser that looms above . in the trials variation , the blocks used to construct the tower are predetermined , so planning is important . the difference in the endless trials version is that the laser slowly rises , allowing you to keep building as long as you are careful and make your tower sturdy .', 'i actually enjoy these modes and the gameplay quite a bit . the gameplay is simple , allowing the mind to figure out the best way to build the required tower . with varied modes and different ways to try them , there is a decent amount of variety . but then there’s my main issue . i’m not completely sure why , but i often noticed the game jittering and forcing my block to shoot down the screen faster than i could react , causing me to fail more levels than i care to count . one of the survival levels burdens the player with a super speedy descent on several of the blocks they need to place . this stage becomes nearly impossible when the game freaked out and jumped while trying to move around .', 'this issue may or may not affect other xbox players , but it plagued my time with the game and left an awful taste in my mouth . i have a few other gripes that are far less important than a gameplay issue like this , like the fact that there is a “shop” button on the main menu that takes you to the xbox marketplace instead of an in - game one . i felt like this is a bit misleading and will probably annoy quite a few gamers . the slightly larger issue i have is that i’m not sure how much replay value the game will hold after a bit . while the physics are interesting and the core gameplay is fun enough , i just didn’t feel like i really wanted to come back to it all that much .', 'it’s a shame too , since the game has such a bright , colourful , and endearing feeling to it . everything from the menu to the characters to the scenery gives off a calm vibe that helps keep the game fun even when it gets tough . this is slightly undercut by the fairly repetitive music , but i still think the art deserves attention . i want to love this game , but in its current state , i can only say i like it .', 'this game is good , with a few negatives .', 'this title is probably better on the pc where i imagine it runs smoother . how it is now , it makes for a decent puzzle title with an interesting concept that is shackled by an issue that ruins the experience by making easy moves difficult and difficult moves impossible .', 'dominoid commented on whatever happened to . . . psi - ops : the mindgate conspiracy ?']"", ""['have you ever played jenga ? you know , that game where you have to remove blocks from a tall stack , without toppling the whole stack over ? well , tricky towers is a little bit like that ; but instead of removing blocks , you’re stacking them . and instead of blocks , it’s tetrominos .', 'it’s a real simple idea . tetromino style blocks fall from the sky , and the main object of the game is to stack as many as you can on top of one another , without the tower losing balance and falling over . of course , there is a little more to it than that , but that’s the main crux of the game .', 'platform : pc , playstation 4 , xbox one ( reviewed ) price : $ 14 . 99 multiplayer : local and online price i’d pay : $ 14 . 99', 'now this may make it sound like some sort of tetris rip - off , but there is far more to than that . first of all , if players accidentally misplace a tetromino in tetris , then it isn’t always a big issue , and players will often be able to recover from it . in tricky towers , even the smallest of errors will have towers falling down in seconds . not only does it encourage forward thinking gameplay , where thinking two or three moves ahead can pay dividends ; but because even the slight misplacement makes a difference , the game has a really risk versus reward mechanic when it comes to playing with other people . do i try and get ahead of the opponent by slamming down blocks , but risk making a mistake , or take it nice and slow and risk losing ground . there’s a surprising amount of depth for a game that’s main focus is battling friends and having fun .', 'there are three main modes in tricky towers , a single player element and both local and online multiplayer modes . single player mode offers up two types of gameplay , a trial mode and an endless mode ; both being exactly what they sound like . trial mode offers up 50 separate challenges for players to ace , and also acts as a way to get used to the different types of game modes available in multiplayer . and endless mode is , well , endless and has three game types ; puzzle , race and survival . it also has a leader board that tracks progress against both friends and other players from around the world . single player certainly offers enough for any player to hop in and out of and get a little enjoyment . but it doesn’t compare to playing the multiplayer modes . the game just didn’t offer the same satisfaction when i was playing local multiplayer , and as a result , it just wasn’t as much fun .', 'the multiplayer modes are , however , an absolute blast , especially local play . players can play with up to three other people and the customization options are plentiful . it offers up the three different game modes that are available in single player , as well as different difficulty settings that can add all sorts of modifiers to make your life more difficult . players can also select from just a single match to an 18 point tournament .', 'with each mode all players are pitted against each other ; either to race to a certain height , survive as long as possible without dropping bricks or arrange the most bricks within a predetermined area . race is without a doubt the best multiplayer mode , with the game handing out power - ups that will either aid in the building quest , or hinder the other players . firing off one of these at friends and watching their fragile creation fall to bits is immensely satisfying , and will definitely lead to some heated exchanges . survival can also get very interesting when the game throws things like high winds into the mix , making it seem impossible for all players . it’s amazing how much can be had by something so simple .', 'playing local multiplayer with friends is where tricky towers comes alive , which is a good thing , as playing with strangers online is a difficult task , simply because there aren’t that many people playing the game . find a match took way too long , and mostly ended up with me backing out and playing a different mode . if you do find a match online , players can expect the same kind of experience as local , just without the risk of losing real friends .', 'i must also take the time to mention that the game offers microtransactions in the form of skins for the bricks and character models . these aren’t that expensive , ranging from 99c to $ 2 . 99 ; but it would have been nice if these were available as unlockables , instead of being locked behind a pay wall .', 'tricky towers is a party game first and foremost , best played with friends . grab some extra controllers and have hours of fun trying to knock the bricks out of your mates . the ease in which your friends will be able to grasp the mechanics is tricky tower’s greatest asset , and it is worth the asking price alone .', 'review copy of game provided by publisher .', 'news editor / reviewer , he also lends his distinct british tones to the n4g radio podcast . when not at his pc , he

'[\', one with which nearly all of you will be familiar . a game that saw you stacking shaped blocks together to make lines that would disappear when done correctly , it was simple but addictive fun .

have at least some kind of reason as to why you are doing something , the game does just fine without . it also allows you to jump straight into whichever mode you choose straight from the off and there is enough variety in the modes to keep you entertained for at least a short while . there is single player , local multiplayer and online multiplayer all on offer , although the online is fairly sparse , which is a shame as time spent there is enjoyable ."", \'whether you are playing alone or with friends , the aim of the game remains largely the same . you must use falling\', \'- style blocks to create a tower , but how you go about managing this tower depends on which game mode you are playing . in race mode , your simple aim is to build your tower high enough so that it reaches a chequered flag . this is the easiest of the modes as you can take it largely at your own pace and it feels less stress inducing than the other two modes . survival mode sees the ai giving you a set number of blocks with which to make your tower . dropping a block will cause you to lose a life ( of which you only have three ) . on top of this , the ai will use different spells in order to mess with the falling blocks , causing them to grow bigger , turn into fragile glass or lock in position . bringing in spells makes the game a whole lot trickier , but they can be used for your benefit on certain modes too .\', ""you have light spells that will help you and dark spells that will cause something bad to happen to your opponent . unfortunately , none of the spells have any explanation as

will figure them all out eventually . their usefulness varies , with some of the better ones reinforcing a block in your tower or causing your opponents bricks to speed up , making them more likely to make a mistake . obviously , they can also use the spells on you however they see fit , so they add an air of uncertainty while playing as to what might happen next , and force you to adapt ."", ""the final mode is puzzle , which sounds like it might be easy but can end up being the hardest of the three modes . there \' s a laser line above which you cannot build your tower and you must think creatively in order to stack a certain number of bricks below this lasered line . crossing it means game over and dropping a brick pushes your tower even closer to the laser , meaning there are obstacles at every turn in this mode . you sometimes have to think outside of the box in this mode . this is encouraging and offers a change from the other gameplay , but often ends up being a little hard and frustrating when you can \' t seem to stack the bricks quite right ."", ""if you \' re playing alone , you have the choice of endless mode or trials . endless is self explanatory with you picking any of the gaming modes and seeing how long you can last . endless also has leaderboards for weekly and monthly scores , so you can test your skills against other people , even if you never manage to play anyone in online multiplayer . the trials , however , are more interesting and a lot harder depending on how far through them you get . there are five different levels of difficulty , including apprentice , pro and master , with 10 trials in each level . these could be a race , survival or puzzle trial , which will task you to complete it without failing . they begin fairly easily and pick up in difficulty quite soon after , so they offer a decent challenge to complete them all ."", \'what seems to be more of a challenge , though , was simply getting the bricks where you want them to go . a trajectory beam shows you where the block will land , giving you a chance to rotate it or speed it up . even with this , it was a struggle to land the block where it was wanted on multiple occasions . the distance between where the block falls and where it will land means it is hard to be accurate and missing one block can cause a domino effect on your poor tower . on top of this , the nudging mechanic that some games have had is present here too , but this seemed even more hit and miss . plenty of times a brick hit the tower and went flying off into the sea instead of the little slot that was saved for it .\', ""on the plus side of things , the game has a cute and charming look with bright colours and cartoon characters everywhere . you can even change your character \' s appearance ( or spend money on additional character packs ) and the look of your blocks with a christmas and easter theme . of course , all of these are superficial and have no bearing on the actual gameplay , but it is nice to be able to make those changes if you so wish . the main characters are all witches and wizards to fit in with having spells in the game , and this is set

skills in hand , you’re pretty much destined for failure . it takes a different kind of tactic to succeed in tricky towers , but thankfully you’ll find a little fun in learning the best courses of action .\', \'to enable this learning process , we find that tricky towers comes with solo , online and local options . now , without beating around the bush , the latter of those is by far the best experience , with tricky towers absolutely excelling in local form .\', \'whether you’re racing to place blocks in order to create the tallest tower possible before your three mates , struggling to

makes it a fun time had by all .\', \'it gets even better once you start learning how to harness both light and dark magic , with the former helping your progress and the latter inflicting pain on any opponent . there really is nothing better than firing across a balloon which happily floats away with your opponents’ last crucial piece to stop them taking a victory . as you can imagine , much shouting and laughter ensues at this point .\', \'but after the appeal of this sofa based multiplayer fun ends , tricky towers begins to struggle . massively .\', \'an included solo mode fails to see any enthusiasm garnered with numerous challenges and an endless mode failing to really deliver . the premise seems fine , but the execution leaves the rookie , apprentice , pro , expert and master challenges to come across as either hugely frustrating or utterly boring . once you’ve completed a race in solo mode , you’ll very rarely wish to bother trying to complete another , and another . because without someone sat next to you , the whole fun factor is fast removed .\', \'the endless mode similarly should be good fun , but again just trying to place yourself on a leaderboard for each of the race , puzzle and survival challenges gets tiresome . find a mate who has the game , giving you the added draw of some leaderboard hunting and the appeal grows a bit . but not for long .\', \'and then we have the online multiplayer . a mode which , from the outside looking in , really could have been built specifically to bring in the fun of tricky towers . except for the fact that absolutely no - one is playing the game . in my time reviewing this title i’ve yet to find a single opponent from the online world , let alone three others who could ever see me fill a full lobby . if ever a game was crying out for xbox games with gold status , this is it because i feel that may be the only way the masses will get some online tricky towers enjoyment – and it’s most definitely the only way anyone who has spent cash on the game will find the opportunity to get involved in the online cup , online game and play with friends options . in a weird twist of fate it seems the developers have unwittingly acknowledged that the game will be a bit quiet on the online front , as the wait for an online friend leaves you staring blankly at a screen with a ghost town feel – with metaphoric wind blowing . the only thing missing is the tumbleweed rolling across screen .\', \'so tricky towers is most definitely a game you should be playing if you can manage to grab a couple of others to sit down alongside you . in fact , as party games go , it’s right up there with the great wonders of this world . but the high asking price and additions of solo and online modes bring very little to the experience , and you shouldn’t be looking to ever get involved on the back of those . and that’s a shame because while the physics work well , the music is decent , and the bright colourful nature it emits is absolutely fine , without anyone to play tricky towers with , you’re left with a game that is very much left wanting .\', ""adorable wizards , delightful magic and the

features falling blocks but the goal is to stack blocks onto a tower rather than clear rows . random blocks drop from the top of the screen and rows do not disappear , but blocks may fall off the tower . during the game , events may cause changes to the block physics , such as doubling in size , becoming slippery , or dropping at faster rates . the player takes control of one of the available wizard avatars and must , depending on the game mode , compete against other wizards in building his wizard tower to be as tall and stable as possible , and as quickly as possible . the games are short and fast paced and are easy to pick up and play . pieces move in half - square increments . players can use magic spells to assist themselves or to hinder opponents . during a match , there are 17 spells which can become available to the player . spells are divided into light and dark magic categories - light magic focuses on augmenting your tower while dark magic revolves around interfering with your opponents , such as damaging or weakening their towers , or meddling with their engineering efforts in other devious ways .



the game has 3 distinct multiplayer game modes : race , survival and puzzle . in the race game mode , players must compete to be the first to build a tower tall enough to pass the finish line . efficiency and construction speed are key to this game mode and it makes for a fast paced and frantic game experience . in survival , the player must try and place a certain number of bricks on their tower without dropping too many and losing their health . they must focus on careful construction and smart application of spells to triumph . the puzzle game mode is more slow paced compared to the other two . players need to try and place as many bricks on their tower as possible below a certain cut - off point . this requires a more creative style of play , as the player has to try and overcome the physics and come up with various engineering solutions .



there are also a number of single - player challenges available , where the player has to try and achieve a certain set of conditions depending on the challenge to succeed . there are also single - player versions of the survival and puzzle game modes where players compete for a high score , and the xbox version of the game has a single - player version of the race game mode .",tricky towers,"['html\n\n\n\nTricky Towers Review (Xbox One) - XboxAddict.com\n\n\n\nXboxAddict\n\n\n\nHome & News\n\n\n\nForums\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nArticles\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nInformation and Game List\n\n\n\nBackwards Compatibility Games List (Xbox 360)\n\n\n\nBackwards Compatibility Games List (Original Xbox)\n\n\n\nFAQ (Forums)\n\n\n\nTalk About It!

Its classic gameplay is as simplistic as it gets, and it has spawned countless iterations and knock offs, all trying to slightly modify the gameplay just enough for it to be different and fresh. Needless to say, when a Tetris-like game releases, I usually don’t take much notice, as we’ve seen it all before. That’s what shocked me about Tricky Towers though, it actually did change things up just enough to be interesting and capture my attention.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers is a byproduct of mashing up classic Tetris and Jenga. Jenga is all about building your tower as high as you can without it toppling while managing the constant fight against gravity. In Tricky Towers, instead of standard Jenga blocks you have the tetromino pieces we’ve come to expect from any Tetris game. The idea is very simple but it works, so not only are you trying to interlock tetromino pieces, but you also need to be mindful of the weight and placement of each piece, as gravity is a factor in your game.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers boasts itself as a multiplayer focused title, not something you see often in many smaller indie games, so it’s a very welcome addition. There is a single player component as well, should you want to relax and play at your own pace. The premise of Tricky Towers is simple: Build up your tower and try and topple your opponent’s, or challenge yourself in the puzzle mode, attempting to use every piece you\'re given without tipping your tower over.\n\n\n\nNaturally, I started to play Tricky Towers simply as a Tetris clone, but there’s a few factors that differentiate itself as a simple knock off. The biggest mechanic you’ll need to become accustomed to is the movement of the pieces. In standard Tetris, each piece is made up of a formation of 1x1 blocks to create its shape, and when you move left or right, your pieces move 1 block exactly. Tricky Towers has half movements, so when you tap left on the D-Pad or the Left Stick, your piece will actually move half a block over. While this means you can make very precise and minor movements, you’re also going to make countless mistakes as you\'ll be slightly off when placing your pieces due to this. It’s not impossible to learn, but something you’ll constantly have to remember.\n\n\n\nThere’s a decent amount of gameplay to be had, even when playing solo, as the game has 50 increasingly difficult levels to tackle in Trial mode. There’s an endless mode to challenge you too, seeing how tall you can build your tower before it inevitably comes crashing down. Puzzle, Race, and Survival modes are the three included modes that will each offer a slightly different experience with widely different strategies. Single player is great if you’re just looking for a few minutes of gameplay, as completing a certain amount of levels will unlock the next tier of difficulty and more stages to complete.\n\n\n\nRace mode is my personal favorite. This mode is simple in concept, as you simply need to beat your opponent to the finish line above. Different strategies are completely viable here; do you build slow and wide, making a sturdy base while slowly building upwards, or do you risk balancing pieces and soar towards the finish line, hoping your tower doesn’t come crashing down? Playing against the AI is one thing, but playing against another player makes it much more challenging and entertaining.\n\n\n\nTo make things more interesting there are power-ups that you’ll gain from reaching certain threshold heights. These power-ups give you an option of being helpful to yourself, or detrimental against your opponent, so you need to quickly weigh which option is better in that certain moment. Do you place an unmovable piece on your tower, creating an anchor-like base to build from, or do you use it against your opponent, causing one of his pieces grow 5 times in size, surely to make his tower crash. These moments are incredibly satisfying, especially once you see the chaos that ensues on your opponent’s tower.\n\n\n\nThere’s more than a dozen different powers to use, each of which have a very specific strategy. As you get near the finish line you\'ll find the match becomes very chaotic, as you not only need to build your tower high enough to reach the finish, you also need your tower to be stable enough to cross and stay up for more than 3 seconds. Do you take more time and build something structurally sound or risk it and hope that it’ll stand for a simple 3 seconds for the win? Using your power-ups at these times is a great way to start fights between friends!\n\n\n\nSurvival mode gives you a specific amount of bricks that need to be placed to win, but you only have three lives, which you lose each time a block falls into the abyss. The first few levels of Survival aren\'t too bad, as you’re not racing against an opponent, so you can be more deliberate with your placements, but eventually these stages become very challenging. Later levels eventually throw distractions at you, like smoke clouds that block your view, usually causing you to misplace your brick placement rather then putting it where you intended, or random pieces growing to 5 times the size, throwing off your perfect build. There are even Survival stages later on where every piece is locked, preventing you from any rotating, so there’s plenty of challenge to be had in this mode.\n\n\n\nPuzzle Mode starts with a predefined platform, challenging you with placing every piece you’re given without any falling into the pit. Oh, but the most difficult thing about this mode is that there’s a laser above the platform, so every piece played must not fall and touch the laser, or you lose. You’ll need to figure out how to interlock each piece just perfectly to complete these levels, for as far as I can tell, there’s only one solution to each of these puzzle levels. They are designed quite well, and you feel a sense of satisfaction when you finally figure out the exact placement of each piece, but expect to be stumped on specific levels for quite some time before you figure out the solution.\n\n\n\nLastly, there’s Endless mode. Here you can attempt to build your tower forever, but every 15 seconds or so a new wave occurs, applying a modifier in attempt to make your tower come crashing down. Some of these modifiers will cause your blocks to fall incredibly fast, become huge pieces, lock the rotation and more. This mode is quite addictive, though a tough modifier will put your skills to the test.\n\n\n\nAll of the modes can be played across multiplayer as well, locally or online, which was a shock to see included. Up to 4 players can compete against one another, making for some chaotic gameplay. You’re able to choose your mode, difficulty, and number of rounds in a tournament. The only problem I found while playing online was that you have to completely back out to the main menu if you want to change the game mode or settings, prompting re-invites to all of your friends. Lastly, and somewhat unfortunately, there’s absolutely no one playing this online, as I’ve been unable to find a single random game every time I’ve tried, so unless you plan on playing local couch co-op, don’t expect there to be a community online playing.\n\n\n\nI enjoyed seeing the online leaderboards, allowing one to see how they stack up against the competition. While the whole game is accessible, there are microtransactions in place in the form of skins for your pieces and character skins. Granted, these aren’t game changing, but it would have been nice to have been able to work towards these unlocks organically within the game itself.\n\n\n\nMultiplayer is where Tricky Tower shines, causing some hilarity at the best of times, and anger directed towards your friends the other times. Sure, you’ll get frustrated now and then, as it’s sometimes hard to recover from a misplaced block, but that’s where the challenge comes for this game. Tricky Tower is quite \'tricky\' to get the hang of, as it takes some time learning, and remembering, the ‘half’ moves the blocks make, and that these same blocks aren’t locked in place once they land. At the end of the day Tricky Towers can be an enjoyable experience, especially if you’re craving some Tetris-like gameplay with a unique twist.\n\n\n\nOverall: 7.5 / 10\n\n\n\nGameplay: 8.0 / 10\n\n\n\nVisuals: 7.0 / 10\n\n\n\nSound: 7.0 / 10\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nXbox Game Search\n\n\n\nSite Statistics\n\n\n\nRegistered Members\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n44,819\n\n\n\nForum Posts\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n725,831\n\n\n\nXbox One Titles\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n1,458\n\n\n\nXbox 360 Titles\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n1,086\n\n\n\nXbox 360 Kinect Titles\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n95\n\n\n\nXbox 360 Arcade Titles\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n585\n\n\n\nOriginal Xbox Titles\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n987\n\n\n\nStaff Reviews:\n\n\n\n1,759\n\n\n\nMember Reviews:\n\n\n\n10,339\n\n\n\nNews Articles:\n\n\n\n14,743\n\n\n\nScreenshots:\n\n\n\n31,834\n\n\n\nXbox 360 Achievements:\n\n\n\n45,112\n\n\n\nXbox 360 Faceplates\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n2,016\n\n\n\nCheat Codes:\n\n\n\n1,706\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\nSpintires: Mudrunner is Getting New DLC this Fall\n\n\n\nFanso of Focus Home Interactive’s sim- like driving game can look forward to new DLC this fall.

Besides simply releasing on the platform, this title also has a unique mode only found on the console, but more on that later. With its challenging puzzle gameplay, the game has players use tetromino blocks to stack giant towers. Unlike Tetris however, Tricky Towers lets players place pieces in hectic and awkward ways, mostly due to the physics that affect them. These mechanics alone make this game far more difficult than I had expected when I first saw it. Add to this that the entire experience takes on a sort of competitive feel, and you can see how the game would be an obvious choice for puzzle lovers that like to show their skill.\n\n\n\nYou may be wondering how you make stacking tetrominos competitive, but it’s actually quite simple. In any given mode, the player will be given blocks (random or predetermined) to twist and stack to reach a certain goal. This changes from mode to mode, but the big takeaway is to make your tower the way the game wants. Sometimes this means making a tall stack, while other times it means making the shortest or sturdiest.\n\n\n\nNo matter the case, players will often need to keep in mind one other thing: magic. Whether Light or Dark, magic can completely change a match. Some of the effects the magic can have include tying blocks together with vines, covering pieces in shrubs that conceal them, destroying the last tetrimino placed, and embiggening the brick being placed.\n\n\n\nThere are three modes to keep in mind, each with their own ways to win. There’s Race, Survival, and Puzzle, all of which can be played either alone or in multiplayer. In single player, these modes are available in Trials and Endless Trials variations. In Race, the player will have to reach a certain height requirement in the given time, often being harassed by an opposing mage. The Endless version of this is the unique game mode found only in the Xbox release, which simply has players race against an ever rising fail line in order to see how high they can stack their tower.\n\n\n\nSurvival requires careful planning and quick wit as the player creates a tower without losing any blocks. For each block (or group of them) lost, a heart is taken away. With only three hearts, it’s easy to see how the Trials version (opposing mage) and Endless Trials version (no mage) can become difficult in a short time. Finally, there’s the Puzzle mode that gives the player a unique base to build off of while staying below the laser that looms above. In the Trials variation, the blocks used to construct the tower are predetermined, so planning is important. The difference in the Endless Trials version is that the laser slowly rises, allowing you to keep building as long as you are careful and make your tower sturdy.\n\n\n\nI actually enjoy these modes and the gameplay quite a bit. The gameplay is simple, allowing the mind to figure out the best way to build the required tower. With varied modes and different ways to try them, there is a decent amount of variety. But then there’s my main issue. I’m not completely sure why, but I often noticed the game jittering and forcing my block to shoot down the screen faster than I could react, causing me to fail more levels than I care to count. One of the Survival levels burdens the player with a super speedy descent on several of the blocks they need to place. This stage becomes nearly impossible when the game freaked out and jumped while trying to move around.\n\n\n\nThis issue may or may not affect other Xbox players, but it plagued my time with the game and left an awful taste in my mouth. I have a few other gripes that are far less important than a gameplay issue like this, like the fact that there is a “Shop” button on the main menu that takes you to the Xbox Marketplace instead of an in-game one. I felt like this is a bit misleading and will probably annoy quite a few gamers. The slightly larger issue I have is that I’m not sure how much replay value the game will hold after a bit. While the physics are interesting and the core gameplay is fun enough, I just didn’t feel like I really wanted to come back to it all that much.\n\n\n\nIt’s a shame too, since the game has such a bright, colourful, and endearing feeling to it. Everything from the menu to the characters to the scenery gives off a calm vibe that helps keep the game fun even when it gets tough. This is slightly undercut by the fairly repetitive music, but I still think the art deserves attention. I want to love this game, but in its current state, I can only say I like it.\n\n\n\n7.50/\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n7 ½\n\n\n\nTricky Towers (Reviewed on Xbox One)\n\n\n\nThis game is good, with a few negatives.\n\n\n\nThis title is probably better on the PC where I imagine it runs smoother. How it is now, it makes for a decent puzzle title with an interesting concept that is shackled by an issue that ruins the experience by making easy moves difficult and difficult moves impossible.\n\n\n\nThis game was supplied by the publisher or relevant PR company for the purposes of review\n\n\n\nTyler Schurwan\n\n\n\nStaff Writer\n\n\n\nResident Dark Souls Expert\n\n\n\nRead more articles by Tyler Schurwan\n\n\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nWant to read more like this?\n\n\n\nJoin the newsletter…\n\n\n\nOTHER STORIES YOU MAY LIKE\n\n\n\nTricky Towers Launches on Xbox One\n\n\n\nRead\n\n\n\nNew Humble Bundle: Hooked on Multiplayer\n\n\n\nRead\n\n\n\nTricky Towers Review\n\n\n\nRead\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\nCOMMENTS\n\n\n\nName:\n\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\nYour comment:\n\n\n\nPlease send me an email when a new comment is added\n\n\n\nAdd Comment\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\nDeveloper\n\n\n\nWeirdBeard\n\n\n\nPublisher\n\n\n\nWeirdBeard\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\n\nLinux , Mac , PlayStation 4 , Windows\n\n\n\nGenre\n\n\n\nCasual\n\n\n\nGame Details\n\n\n\nLog in / Register\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nOR\n\n\n\nRemember me?\n\n\n\nLogin Register Forgotten?\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\nThe Best Spider-Man Game on Every Platform Part Two: Dreamcast to PlayStation 4\n\n\n\nAnother 6 Things Videogames Have (Basically) Stopped Doing\n\n\n\nHarry Potter Hogwarts Mystery Welcomes You Back To Hogwarts For Year Five\n\n\n\nSpider-Man Becomes Fastest Selling UK Game of 2018\n\n\n\nFear The Wolves Preview\n\n\n\nWar Tech Fighters Review\n\n\n\nUpcoming Releases\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider 14 th September 2018 (World Wide)\n\n\n\nNefarious 14 th September 2018 (World Wide)\n\n\n\nHENTAI BATTLEGROUNDS ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 17 th September 2018 (World Wide)\n\n\n\nHover 18 th September 2018 (World Wide)\n\n\n\nLandinar: Into the Void 18 th September 2018 (World Wide)\n\n\n\nCommunity Feed\n\n\n\ndominoid added Graveyard Keeper to their games\n\n\n\ndominoid added R-Type Dimensions to their wishlist\n\n\n\ndominoid commented on Got Kids?

You know, that game where you have to remove blocks from a tall stack, without toppling the whole stack over? Well, Tricky Towers is a little bit like that; but instead of removing blocks, you’re stacking them. And instead of blocks, it’s Tetrominos.\n\n\n\nIt’s a real simple idea. Tetromino style blocks fall from the sky, and the main object of the game is to stack as many as you can on top of one another, without the tower losing balance and falling over. Of course, there is a little more to it than that, but that’s the main crux of the game.\n\n\n\nPlatform: PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One (reviewed) Price: $14.99 Multiplayer: Local and Online Price I’d pay: $14.99\n\n\n\nNow this may make it sound like some sort of Tetris rip-off, but there is far more to than that. First of all, if players accidentally misplace a Tetromino in Tetris, then it isn’t always a big issue, and players will often be able to recover from it. In Tricky Towers, even the smallest of errors will have towers falling down in seconds. Not only does it encourage forward thinking gameplay, where thinking two or three moves ahead can pay dividends; but because even the slight misplacement makes a difference, the game has a really risk versus reward mechanic when it comes to playing with other people. Do I try and get ahead of the opponent by slamming down blocks, but risk making a mistake, or take it nice and slow and risk losing ground. There’s a surprising amount of depth for a game that’s main focus is battling friends and having fun.\n\n\n\nThere are three main modes in Tricky Towers, a single player element and both local and online multiplayer modes. Single player mode offers up two types of gameplay, a trial mode and an endless mode; both being exactly what they sound like. Trial mode offers up 50 separate challenges for players to ace, and also acts as a way to get used to the different types of game modes available in multiplayer. And endless mode is, well, endless and has three game types; puzzle, race and survival. It also has a leader board that tracks progress against both friends and other players from around the world. Single player certainly offers enough for any player to hop in and out of and get a little enjoyment. But it doesn’t compare to playing the multiplayer modes. The game just didn’t offer the same satisfaction when I was playing local multiplayer, and as a result, it just wasn’t as much fun.\n\n\n\nThe multiplayer modes are, however, an absolute blast, especially local play. Players can play with up to three other people and the customization options are plentiful. It offers up the three different game modes that are available in single player, as well as different difficulty settings that can add all sorts of modifiers to make your life more difficult. Players can also select from just a single match to an 18 point tournament.\n\n\n\nWith each mode all players are pitted against each other; either to race to a certain height, survive as long as possible without dropping bricks or arrange the most bricks within a predetermined area. Race is without a doubt the best multiplayer mode, with the game handing out power-ups that will either aid in the building quest, or hinder the other players. Firing off one of these at friends and watching their fragile creation fall to bits is immensely satisfying, and will definitely lead to some heated exchanges. Survival can also get very interesting when the game throws things like high winds into the mix, making it seem impossible for all players. It’s amazing how much can be had by something so simple.\n\n\n\nPlaying local multiplayer with friends is where Tricky Towers comes alive, which is a good thing, as playing with strangers online is a difficult task, simply because there aren’t that many people playing the game. Find a match took way too long, and mostly ended up with me backing out and playing a different mode. If you do find a match online, players can expect the same kind of experience as local, just without the risk of losing real friends.\n\n\n\nI must also take the time to mention that the game offers microtransactions in the form of skins for the bricks and character models. These aren’t that expensive, ranging from 99c to $2.99; but it would have been nice if these were available as unlockables, instead of being locked behind a pay wall.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers is a party game first and foremost, best played with friends. Grab some extra controllers and have hours of fun trying to knock the bricks out of your mates. The ease in which your friends will be able to grasp the mechanics is Tricky Tower’s greatest asset, and it is worth the asking price alone.\n\n\n\nReview copy of game provided by publisher.\n\n\n\nHave your say!\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nWritten by\n\n\n\nJohn Whitehouse\n\n\n\nNews Editor/Reviewer, he also lends his distinct British tones to the N4G Radio Podcast.

A game that saw you stacking shaped blocks together to make lines that would disappear when done correctly, it was simple but addictive fun. Weird Beard Games has now brought us\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\n, which has taken aspects of the original\n\n\n\nTetris\n\n\n\ngame and turned it into something new, where you must build towers from those shaped blocks.\n\n\n\nRace, Survival and Puzzle are the three game modes\n\n\n\nAs is often the case with these kind of games,\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\nhas no story or plotline. Whilst it's often nice to have at least some kind of reason as to why you are doing something, the game does just fine without. It also allows you to jump straight into whichever mode you choose straight from the off and there is enough variety in the modes to keep you entertained for at least a short while. There is single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer all on offer, although the online is fairly sparse, which is a shame as time spent there is enjoyable.\n\n\n\nWhether you are playing alone or with friends, the aim of the game remains largely the same. You must use falling\n\n\n\nTetris\n\n\n\n-style blocks to create a tower, but how you go about managing this tower depends on which game mode you are playing. In Race mode, your simple aim is to build your tower high enough so that it reaches a chequered flag. This is the easiest of the modes as you can take it largely at your own pace and it feels less stress inducing than the other two modes. Survival mode sees the AI giving you a set number of blocks with which to make your tower. Dropping a block will cause you to lose a life (of which you only have three). On top of this, the AI will use different spells in order to mess with the falling blocks, causing them to grow bigger, turn into fragile glass or lock in position. Bringing in spells makes the game a whole lot trickier, but they can be used for your benefit on certain modes too.\n\n\n\nYou have light spells that will help you and dark spells that will cause something bad to happen to your opponent. Unfortunately, none of the spells have any explanation as to what they do, so it's simply a case of trying it out and hoping for the best. Some kind of key, or a little pop up the first time you picked up a spell, would have been helpful, but you will figure them all out eventually. Their usefulness varies, with some of the better ones reinforcing a block in your tower or causing your opponents bricks to speed up, making them more likely to make a mistake. Obviously, they can also use the spells on you however they see fit, so they add an air of uncertainty while playing as to what might happen next, and force you to adapt.\n\n\n\nMore people means more chance of spells\n\n\n\nThe final mode is Puzzle, which sounds like it might be easy but can end up being the hardest of the three modes. There's a laser line above which you cannot build your tower and you must think creatively in order to stack a certain number of bricks below this lasered line. Crossing it means game over and dropping a brick pushes your tower even closer to the laser, meaning there are obstacles at every turn in this mode. You sometimes have to think outside of the box in this mode. This is encouraging and offers a change from the other gameplay, but often ends up being a little hard and frustrating when you can't seem to stack the bricks quite right.\n\n\n\nIf you're playing alone, you have the choice of endless mode or trials. Endless is self explanatory with you picking any of the gaming modes and seeing how long you can last. Endless also has leaderboards for weekly and monthly scores, so you can test your skills against other people, even if you never manage to play anyone in online multiplayer. The trials, however, are more interesting and a lot harder depending on how far through them you get. There are five different levels of difficulty, including apprentice, pro and master, with 10 trials in each level. These could be a race, survival or puzzle trial, which will task you to complete it without failing. They begin fairly easily and pick up in difficulty quite soon after, so they offer a decent challenge to complete them all.\n\n\n\nWhat seems to be more of a challenge, though, was simply getting the bricks where you want them to go. A trajectory beam shows you where the block will land, giving you a chance to rotate it or speed it up. Even with this, it was a struggle to land the block where it was wanted on multiple occasions. The distance between where the block falls and where it will land means it is hard to be accurate and missing one block can cause a domino effect on your poor tower. On top of this, the nudging mechanic that some games have had is present here too, but this seemed even more hit and miss. Plenty of times a brick hit the tower and went flying off into the sea instead of the little slot that was saved for it.\n\n\n\nTrust your nudging skills on that high tower, I dare you\n\n\n\nOn the plus side of things, the game has a cute and charming look with bright colours and cartoon characters everywhere. You can even change your character's appearance (or spend money on additional character packs) and the look of your blocks with a Christmas and Easter theme. Of course, all of these are superficial and have no bearing on the actual gameplay, but it is nice to be able to make those changes if you so wish. The main characters are all witches and wizards to fit in with having spells in the game, and this is set perfectly with some spooky sounding music tracks to which you might find yourself bobbing along as you play.\n\n\n\nIn terms of achievements, there are 29 to earn and you will have to work hard to earn most of them. Completing and unlocking the various trials will earn you a number of achievements, with some of them having\n\n\n\nspecial objectives\n\n\n\ntied to them. The online achievements, including\n\n\n\nwinning a cup\n\n\n\nand taking part in all the various modes, will take a while if you are waiting to find a partner, but less time if you boost them. There's also a few miscellaneous achievements thrown in too, so completing the game will be quite an impressive feat, probably requiring you to spend more time with the game that you'd want.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\nis game that strikes you as simple from the outside, but once you start playing you realise it's actually quite hard to master. The game is enjoyable and addictive both online and offline, with a good choice of modes to play either against others or on your own. Unfortunately building towers isn't always easy to do as the trajectory beam doesn't always seem to be accurate enough and you have no idea what your spells do until you actually try and use them. Overall, the game is fun for a short time, but it's never anything on which you are going to spend a huge amount of time.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nPositives\n\n\n\nSimple but addictive gameplay\n\n\n\nMultiplayer game modes are enjoyable\n\n\n\nNice choice of modes and trials\n\n\n\nNegatives\n\n\n\nNo explanation for what spells do\n\n\n\nNot always obvious where bricks will land, even with beam\n\n\n\nHave to be very accurate with the nudge mechanic\n\n\n\nEthics Statement\n\n\n\nThe reviewer spent approximately 6 hours stacking some bricks and dropping a whole lot more, unlocking 12 of the game's 29 achievements.

Surely Tricky Towers cannot fail?\n\n\n\nWell, that all depends what you’re looking for because even though the development team at WeirdBeard Games have delivered us a Tetris style puzzle affair that should cater for the solo player, the online gamer and those who prefer their multiplayer enjoyment with the comfort of a friend beside them on the sofa, the overall enjoyment actually found is a tad more limited.\n\n\n\nArmed with a small patch of land, it is up to you to cleverly navigate numerous dropping tetrominoes in order to build the tallest, sturdiest, most well established tower you possibly can. With the usual Tetris styled shapes that we know and love all present, anyone who is familiar with block dropping should pretty much know what to expect with Tricky Towers. Except for the fact that should you try and play the game with all your best Tetris skills in hand, you’re pretty much destined for failure. It takes a different kind of tactic to succeed in Tricky Towers, but thankfully you’ll find a little fun in learning the best courses of action.\n\n\n\nTo enable this learning process, we find that Tricky Towers comes with solo, online and local options. Now, without beating around the bush, the latter of those is by far the best experience, with Tricky Towers absolutely excelling in local form.\n\n\n\nWhether you’re racing to place blocks in order to create the tallest tower possible before your three mates, struggling to squeeze in as many pieces below a laser beam or just attempting to stop them falling into the dark abyss beneath your land, the challenge, the shouting, the bragging rights and the digs in the ribs makes it a fun time had by all.\n\n\n\nIt gets even better once you start learning how to harness both light and dark magic, with the former helping your progress and the latter inflicting pain on any opponent. There really is nothing better than firing across a balloon which happily floats away with your opponents’ last crucial piece to stop them taking a victory. As you can imagine, much shouting and laughter ensues at this point.\n\n\n\nBut after the appeal of this sofa based multiplayer fun ends, Tricky Towers begins to struggle. Massively.\n\n\n\nAn included solo mode fails to see any enthusiasm garnered with numerous challenges and an endless mode failing to really deliver. The premise seems fine, but the execution leaves the rookie, apprentice, pro, expert and master challenges to come across as either hugely frustrating or utterly boring. Once you’ve completed a race in solo mode, you’ll very rarely wish to bother trying to complete another, and another. Because without someone sat next to you, the whole fun factor is fast removed.\n\n\n\nThe endless mode similarly should be good fun, but again just trying to place yourself on a leaderboard for each of the Race, Puzzle and Survival challenges gets tiresome. Find a mate who has the game, giving you the added draw of some leaderboard hunting and the appeal grows a bit. But not for long.\n\n\n\nAnd then we have the online multiplayer. A mode which, from the outside looking in, really could have been built specifically to bring in the fun of Tricky Towers. Except for the fact that absolutely no-one is playing the game. In my time reviewing this title I’ve yet to find a single opponent from the online world, let alone three others who could ever see me fill a full lobby. If ever a game was crying out for Xbox Games With Gold status, this is it because I feel that may be the only way the masses will get some online Tricky Towers enjoyment – and it’s most definitely the only way anyone who has spent cash on the game will find the opportunity to get involved in the Online Cup, Online Game and Play With Friends options. In a weird twist of fate it seems the developers have unwittingly acknowledged that the game will be a bit quiet on the online front, as the wait for an online friend leaves you staring blankly at a screen with a ghost town feel – with metaphoric wind blowing. The only thing missing is the tumbleweed rolling across screen.\n\n\n\nSo Tricky Towers is most definitely a game you should be playing if you can manage to grab a couple of others to sit down alongside you. In fact, as party games go, it’s right up there with the great wonders of this world. But the high asking price and additions of solo and online modes bring very little to the experience, and you shouldn’t be looking to ever get involved on the back of those. And that’s a shame because while the physics work well, the music is decent, and the bright colourful nature it emits is absolutely fine, without anyone to play Tricky Towers with, you’re left with a game that is very much left wanting.\n\n\n\nEven all the wizards in the world can’t help it!\n\n\n\nAdorable wizards, delightful magic and the chance to build the towers of our dreams. Surely Tricky Towers cannot fail? Well, that all depends what you\'re looking for because even though the development team at WeirdBeard Games have delivered us a Tetris style puzzle affair that should cater for the solo player, the online gamer and those who prefer their multiplayer enjoyment with the comfort of a friend beside them on the sofa, the overall enjoyment actually found is a tad more limited. Armed with a small patch of land, it is up to you to cleverly navigate numerous dropping tetrominoes…\n\n\n\nTricky Towers Review\n\n\n\nTricky Towers Review\n\n\n\n2017-10-09\n\n\n\nNeil Watton (neil363)\n\n\n\nMassive thanks to - Virtual Air Guitar Company\n\n\n\nFormats - Xbox One (Review)\n\n\n\nMassive thanks to - WeirdBeard Games\n\n\n\nFormats - Xbox One (Review), PS4, PC\n\n\n\nTXH Score\n\n\n\n2.5/5\n\n\n\nMassive thanks to - Virtual Air Guitar Company\n\n\n\nFormats - Xbox One (Review)\n\n\n\nMassive thanks to - WeirdBeard Games\n\n\n\nFormats - Xbox One (Review), PS4, PC\n\n\n\nUser Rating:\n\n\n\nBe the first one !\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nOne\n\n\n\nOne reviews\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nGoogle+\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\nPrevious article\n\n\n\nShiny Review\n\n\n\nNext article\n\n\n\nEarly gameplay footage released of Q.U.B.E. 2\n\n\n\nNeil Watton (neil363)\n\n\n\nhttp://www.thexboxhub.com\n\n\n\nAn Xbox gamer since 2002, I bought the big black box just to play Oddworld: Munch\'s Oddysee.

It features falling blocks but the goal is to stack blocks onto a tower rather than clear rows. Random blocks drop from the top of the screen and rows do not disappear, but blocks may fall off the tower. During the game, events may cause changes to the block physics, such as doubling in size, becoming slippery, or dropping at faster rates. The player takes control of one of the available wizard avatars and must, depending on the game mode, compete against other wizards in building his wizard tower to be as tall and stable as possible, and as quickly as possible. The games are short and fast paced and are easy to pick up and play. Pieces move in half-square increments.Players can use magic spells to assist themselves or to hinder opponents.  During a match, there are 17 spells which can become available to the player. Spells are divided into Light and Dark magic categories - Light magic focuses on augmenting your tower while Dark Magic revolves around interfering with your opponents, such as damaging or weakening their towers, or meddling with their engineering efforts in other devious ways.



The game has 3 distinct multiplayer game modes: Race, Survival and Puzzle. In the Race game mode, players must compete to be the first to build a tower tall enough to pass the finish line. Efficiency and construction speed are key to this game mode and it makes for a fast paced and frantic game experience. In Survival, the player must try and place a certain number of bricks on their tower without dropping too many and losing their health. They must focus on careful construction and smart application of spells to triumph. The Puzzle game mode is more slow paced compared to the other two. Players need to try and place as many bricks on their tower as possible below a certain cut-off point. This requires a more creative style of play, as the player has to try and overcome the physics and come up with various engineering solutions.



There are also a number of single-player challenges available, where the player has to try and achieve a certain set of conditions depending on the challenge to succeed. There are also single-player versions of the Survival and Puzzle game modes where players compete for a high score, and the Xbox version of the game has a single-player version of the Race game mode.",Tricky Towers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricky_Towers
41266,Tricky Towers,PlayStation 4,tricky towers,"[""['tetrominoes have shown up in a good number of games since making their debut in tetris back in 1984 . some notable playstation network titles that make use of tetrominoes include the multiplayer tower - defense game slam bolt scrappers and the single - player zen space rts rymdkapsel . tricky towers is the newest addition to bunch . developed by weirdbeard games , a six person team from the netherlands , tricky towers is a prime example of iterative design leading to a stellar ‘final’ product . as brad accurately and humorously put it the first time he played it , tricky towers is the dark souls of tetris games . after about a dozen hours with the game and a fierce , month long leaderboard back - and - forth , i have to say i agree with his sentiments .', 'weirdbeard first released a form of tricky towers in 2009 , with a flash game titled 99 bricks . the premise of the game was simple – you have 99 tetrominoes to build a tower that doesn’t fall over or lose any of its pieces . it takes the familiarity of tetris and changes the objective a bit . now , instead of getting rid of blocks , you want to build upward in a way that keeps all or some of your blocks from tipping over . all of a sudden , physics , architectural design , and suspense enter arena . in 2014 , weirdbeard released 99 bricks : wizard academy for mobile devices . this retooled version of the game included a boatload of character along with a wide variety of quests to accomplish as you make your way through the ranks of tower - building wizardry . wizard academy is strategic , accessible , and fun . if you’re looking for a way to lose chunks of time on your smartphone , look no further . tricky towers adds a few new features to the mix , most notably multiplayer and dedicated game types .', 'the first thing that grabbed my attention about an early tricky towers trailer was the four - player multiplayer . i was a huge fan of slam bolt scrappers when that released back in 2011 , and the tetris game that released on psn that same year was incredible . those games were most fun with a group of people playing together ( locally in sbs ‘s case , online or offline in tetris ‘s ) . the same can be said about tricky towers . there are three game types and three difficulties that can both be shuffled to create an endless slew of multiplayer delight . when i fired it up with three friends a few weeks back , we all went from complete noobs to fierce competitors in the span of about an hour . it was great having a game where prior skills didn’t play too much of a factor in who was the best . i’m pretty damn good at tetris and wasn’t nearly winning as often as i expected to be . the game supports online multiplayer but since only a few of us are playing before release , i can’t really comment on what the experience / level - up system is all about . we didn’t have any problems getting into games together , though , which is a good sign .', 'in addition to the multiplayer madness , there’s also a fair bit of single - player content on display . trials are split up into three different categories , which also make up the multiplayer modes . in puzzle , you have predetermined starting platforms and a handful of tetrominoes to place below a laser . in the single - player trials , if you hit the laser , you lose . the challenge lies in somehow twisting and delicately placing all of the blocks into a space that seems altogether too small . in multplayer , touching the laser with a placed block boosts your entire tower upward , which is not a good thing . the player who can fit the most blocks underneath the laser is the winner . in race , you aim to stack upward towards a floating checkered flag . in multiplayer , there are checkmarks where you receive light / dark magic spells to help / hurt yourself / your opponents . for example , the 2x block dark magic spell causes opponents’ current blocks to inflate in size and weight . an example of a light magic spell would be the life - saving cement block , which sticks its landing and remains in place no matter how wobbly the rest of your ramshackle tower seems to be . there’s a great moment in race when you realize you’re close to the flag . at this point , you start placing blocks on top of each other , reaching for the line and thus abandoning any sort of pride you have in your tower’s structural or aesthetic appeal , just hoping that it will stand for 3 seconds to grant you the win . finally , there’s survival , wherein your objective is to place a determined number of blocks without losing three lives . each time you drop one , you lose a life . as simple as it sounds , it’s remarkably difficult to survive all the way through your inventory . the final single - player mode is one that brad and i know all too well – endless . in endless , it’s all about how many bricks you can place . every 10 - 20 seconds ( brad stopwatched it ) , a wave hits that sends a new modifier ( big blocks , locked rotation , fast drops , etc . ) your way for a short while . since we received vouchers for the game a few weeks back , we have been duking it out , climbing the leaderboards and stretching our abilities to untold heights . here’s the part where i want to discuss addiction and randomness .', 'i have definitely fallen victim to the charms of addictive games my fair share of times , losing hours upon hours in what are usually terribly repetitive acts . tricky towers is addictive . the endless mode in particular is crazy addictive . in the past month , i have regularly sat down to have just one go at beating brad’s score only to find myself emerge , an hour and a half later , finally victorious or frustratingly unsuccessful . the music , which is perhaps my favorite part of the game , will likely have a cozy place in my brain for a long time coming due to the hours spent playing the same exact mode over and over . here’s the rub – each run is relatively random . the tetrominoes you get and , more importantly , the waves you must deal with , are random to a point that i think is beyond taming by skill only . i have gotten really good at this game ( even the devs say so ) , but i’m still forced to play for over an hour for that one run where the waves and tetriminoes aren’t too punishing . there’s so much good about this game that i can’t even dwell too heavily on this aspect , but it is irksome to have to rely on a roll of the proverbial dice in order to get a truly strong roll . if new content is added to the game , i hope an endless single - player mode that isn’t too reliant on luck is implemented . the trials are great , and the multiplayer is a blast , but there’s something so savagely competitive about leaderboard bouts that should not be hindered by chance .', 'there’s a joy to building something up only to watch it inevitably crumble that i think makes jenga such a long - lasting novelty . it’s such an innate task – placing things atop each other to get as high as possible – that we practice from a young age , and that’s where the magic of tricky towers is derived from . it is challenging to build a freestanding edifice . there are shapes , counter - weights , and balancing that we have to constantly keep in mind when designing our masterpieces . what’s great is that there is fun to be had both in the process ( building ) and in the result ( falling ) . i have never walked away from the game angry . frustrated ? sometimes . but angry ? nope . placing that final keystone to solidify my creation has always injected a dose of lightheartedness to the experience . if you like building in any capacity , or are looking for yet another top - notch multiplayer psn game , tricky towers is for you . see you on the leaderboards !', 'a copy of this game was provided by the publisher for review purposes . for more info on our review policy click here .', 'sound design and presentation as a whole .', 'no local / online hybrid multiplayer .', 'copyright psnstores . com . we are not affiliated with or endorsed by sony computer entertainment america , its partners , subsidiaries or parent companies . this site is designed by : @ pspenguin']"", '[\'each month playstation fans eagerly await the next bunch of ps + freebies . they speculate wildly , somehow expecting that it’ll be some full retail release from a month ago and then , without fail , are gutted when it turns out to be some indie game that looks like it belongs on an iphone .\', \'this month we got tricky towers and it is far from being a full retail game . just look at those screenshots . i get it , you didn’t buy a ps4 to play a cartoony version of tetris . as such , i imagine a lot of people won’t even bother downloading this and that’s a shame , because tricky towers is decent .\', \'to explain what it is , i have to put down the elephant in the room . this isn’t a tetris clone . sure , it uses tetromino pieces , the usual collection of four - piece blocks that you’re used to . but you don’t complete lines here and no blocks are taken away . instead this is a game about stacking pieces .\', \'starting from a solid base , your aim is generally to stack the falling pieces as high as possible . what makes this tricky , and makes tricky towers great , is the fact that the blocks are affected by physics and gravity . the weight of the blocks has to be considered . the best way to explain it is , imagine the line shaped tetramino ( four blocks in a straight line ) . if you were putting that onto another block , it’d need at least 50 % of it to be resting on the block below or else it will just topple off .\', \'so , instead of rushing to get as high as possible , you really need to build firm , interlocking foundations . it becomes , no pun intended , a balancing act . when to stack versus when to solidify . it’s a clever game mechanic and really elevates the game beyond the usual slew of tetris rip - offs we’ve seen over the years .\', \'the game generally has three styles of play . you either build as high as possible , use as many blocks as possible or stay below a certain height limit . the latter option forming a puzzle mode where you try to tightly stack a set number of pieces while staying underneath a target line . this really teaches you the real way to play the game as you start learning how to predict the behaviour of structures .\', \'the puzzle levels can be quite tricky , probably the hardest levels in the game , but they are still quite enjoyable but , for me at least , the modes where you try to build as big a tower as possible are the most fun .\', \'aside from 50 single - player levels and an endless mode , the game also has local and online multiplayer modes . with this being a freebie , the game is well - populated online and , despite usually sacking off anything that involves playing with randoms , i’m properly loving playing this online . there are no lag issues at all and the three game modes ( puzzle , race and survival ) are all enjoyable .\', \'the game’s simplicity is an issue . yes , it’s a bit different to the usual tetris or match - three puzzlers you usually get , but this is still a puzzle game and so that might put some people off and the simple presentation isn’t going to turn any heads ( although to be fair you don’t really want the graphics getting in the way of this sort of thing ) .\', \'however , when it comes to addictiveness , the game has it in spades . the trophies deserve a mention too as they are genuinely challenging and going for them will improve your overall game .\', \'beyond that there isn’t much else to say . the physics aspect adds a really nice twist to the usual puzzle gameplay but if you’re not a fan of the genre , this maybe isn’t the game for you . as far as prices go , you can’t beat free . so give tricky towers a go , especially online , and you might find yourself unable to put it down .\', \'+ physics elements add a really nice extra element to the tetris - esque gameplay . + good choice of online modes , and decent netcode . + challenging trophies . + hyper addictive gameplay . + free ( in august 2016 ) .\', \'- quite a simple concept , so the flavour may wear off eventually . - presentation is pretty simplistic .\', ""tricky towers may look like the sort of unwanted freebie that ps + owners have been bemoaning for years but this is good . when you get over the fact that it isn \' t quite tetris , the clever game engine makes tricky towers the most addictive puzzler on psn and with its well - populated online community , this is the perfect pick up and play game around ."", ""rich is the editor of playstation country . he likes his games lemony and low - budget with a lot of charm . this isn \' t his photo . that \' ll be rik mayall .""]', ""['the tetris formula is one beloved by many arcade puzzle fans around the world – myself included .', 'many games have expanded on the traditional formula , introducing new quirky mechanics to keep the formula fresh . alongside this formula , physics - based puzzle games have maintained popularity in the form of both flash games on the web and on other platforms . in 2009 , developer weirdbeard games released a physics - based puzzler with tetris elements called 99 bricks . seven years later , weirdbeard released tricky towers , a game that expands on 99 bricks ’ tower - building premise by adding more modes and emphasising competitive play . does this new tower - building puzzler stack up ? let’s find out .', 'upon playing your first round of tricky towers , you’ll immediately notice that the blocks falling from the top of the screen are extremely reminiscent of those found in tetris . similar still is that you are expected to interlock these falling blocks to create a study structure , free of gaps and instabilities . what you’ll notice , however , is that there are no walls to protect your bricks from falling . the built - in physics emphasise the need for quick but careful construction . build a sloppy structure and , guaranteed , it will come crumbling down .', 'building your tower is not all you have to focus on , though . you play as a wizard and , while constructing your own tower , you will acquire light and dark spells to help yourself and harm your foes , respectively . for example , some light spells may remove the most recent block you placed or create a floating surface for you to start building anew . dark spells may force your opponents to place a super - sized block or make it so their block falls at an excruciatingly slow pace . spells add a layer of interaction between players that makes a traditionally isolated building experience feel all the more connected .', 'three game modes are available in both single - player and multiplayer ( local and online ) modes : puzzle , race and survival . puzzle mode provides you with predetermined blocks that you must fit in carefully without making contact with a laser hanging slightly above . race is as you would expect ; you must be the fastest at creating a tall enough tower to reach a hanging checkered line . in survival , players are given three lives to build a tower larger than those made by their opponents . if a brick falls , a life is lost . each game mode is genuinely enjoyable , and having modes that require different speeds of play and forms of strategy is an excellent way to keep players coming back for more .', 'it quickly becomes apparent that single - player is not the way that tricky towers is meant to be played . playing alone feels lonely and sluggish , and it brings attention to some of the game’s flaws . for example , the music and sounds in single - player are largely repetitive and uninteresting . the difficulty spike in single - player is also jarring . single - player does have one additional mode that is extremely alluring , however : endless mode . endless mode is as you would expect : place as many blocks as you can without having your tower crumble . while building your tower , you must endure frequent waves of modifiers that negatively impact your building prowess . these modifiers appear randomly , and while the randomness may irritate those trying to climb the leaderboards , they never stopped me from wanting to try just one more time .', 'i feel the need to emphasize this : this game is , without a doubt , meant to be played in multiplayer . whether it’s with three friends on the couch or with strangers online , tricky towers is , in every way , better as a party game . building your own tower feels instantly more chaotic as you glance over to see how your opponents are doing . just as you get confident that you’ll take home the victory , one of your opponents casts dark magic to ruin your lead ( and quite possibly your mood ) . i found myself playing for hours with complete strangers and , win or lose , i had an absolute blast . rounds also often finish quickly enough so that early crumblers won’t have to wait long to get in on the next match . gameplay also always felt goofy and light -

toting friends . so it is then that we can happily add one more to those hallowed ranks , in the form of tricky towers from splendidly named amsterdam - based developer weirdbeard .\', \'the first thing you need to know is that tricky towers both looks and plays like the spawn of tetris and jenga which is not a bad thing at all , though inconceivably staunch haters of either the latter or the former will certainly struggle to enjoy tricky towers’ base premise . for everyone else , you’ll be relieved to know that the game plays extremely familiarly for the most part , in so far as you have different coloured blocks that tumble down the screen which must be rotated and shuffled into place to fashion a colourful tower of awe - inspiring glory .\', \'immediately however , veteran tetris players will notice that something is amiss ; some cheeky rascal has only gone and applied a physics system to the whole thing and in the most literal terms , it is an absolute game - changer . rather than being able to position blocks absolutely as has always been the case with tetris and the numerous clones which have followed in its wake , tricky towers has blocks that wobble , tumble and fall depending however they’ve been positioned and as you can rightly imagine , this adds a whole new dimension to the proceedings that makes tricky towers feel like a proper hybrid of tetris and jenga .\', \'accompanying the absolute bedlam that this new physics system permits are the light and dark magic spells that are available in each match , because you see , rather than being some disembodied block manipulating deity , players are actually cast as a nutty little wizard who has the ability to both enhance their own blocking - dropping prospects whilst also disrupting those of their opponents . in terms of the light spells which can aid your own progression , these include such useful summonings as magnets that help your blocks stick together and lightning bolts that can destroy troublesome placed blocks to name just a couple .\', \'over on the a - hole side of the magical fence , dark spells can properly screw up the momentum of opposing players by doing everything from making supermassive ( and thus horrendously hard to place ) versions of their falling blocks appear to tying balloons around the blocks and thus preventing their accelerated descent . in short , there is no shortage of ways to annoy your fellow player ; just expect such shenanigans to be returned in kind because , well , that’s all part of the fun .\', \'and what fun it is . playing contrary to tetris’ traditionally slow starting pace , multiplayer games in tricky towers are frequently a riot , fuelled as they are by the broad objectives of the various game modes and of course , the naturally frantic escapades of trying to outdo your foes with whatever spells are at your disposal .\', \'speaking of those various modes , tricky towers supports a trio of different game types ; race , puzzle and survival across single - player , local multiplayer and online multiplayer configurations . of the three , survival sticks closest to the original tetris format , though race and puzzle are arguably far more interesting . in the case of the latter , players are given a specific number of blocks that must be arranged in such a way that they don’t creep over a predetermined line , with the first person to arrange their blocks correctly without exhausting their three lives being deemed the winner . by placing a premium simultaneously on both logic and speed , the gradually more difficult puzzles excel as both brilliantly intense brain - teasers and also as prime competitive material in a way that very few other games can offer .\', \'in regards to the race mode , tricky towers embraces a different sort of intensity as players rush to build a tower as quickly as possible in order to reach a finish line suspended high in the sky . the kicker to this though , is that it isn’t enough to just stack a rickety arrangement of skyward pointed blocks to reach the finish line because the tower must be able to stand above the finish line for a full three seconds in order for the player to be declared the victor . as you can well imagine then , such matches are furiously contested affairs that elicit as many laughs and raucous whoops as just about any other multiplayer game available on ps4 .\', \'if anything , it’s a shame that there aren’t more game modes on offer . with the level of imagination evident in the design of the puzzle and race levels , weirdbeard has opened the door to a reimagining of a classic formula that could still go in a number of different directions , so here’s hoping that any future content which may , or may not , be in development for the game includes more content in this vein .\', \'in a time when local multiplayer efforts aren’t really known for taxing the cerebrum , it’s refreshing to see one such effort that does exactly that . a confident evolution of alexey pajitnov’s 1984 classic tetris , tricky towers augments the founding compelling principles of that landmark title with some entertaining game modes , and a fiendishly sly selection of game - changing spells . despite such advancements however , tricky towers’ appeal remains firmly rooted with those who found joy with pajitnov’s block - dropping puzzler all those years ago and as such , newcomers may struggle to embrace its substantial , though subversive charm .\', \'not just an exceptional title that breathes fresh life into the traditional tetris formula , tricky towers also gives a great account of itself for those folks looking to test their brains rather than their trigger fingers in both local and online multiplayer gatherings .\', \'html public "" -

known brick - stacking game . in fact , weirdbeard games probably took a long hard look at the most successful titles of all time and thought “tetris… no one’s bettered that yet ! ” , and decided to have a go themselves . tricky towers doesn’t have the purity , or likely the longevity of tetris , but there is fun to be had with it , as long as you’ve got a friend or three on hand .\', \'single player content either takes the form of a series of trials which ramp up across five difficulty levels , or an endless mode which does exactly what it sounds like . as you start , you choose from a cute wizard - y type whose magic you’re relying on to build your tricky tower , and tricky is definitely the operative word .\', \'imagine playing tetris without its left and right boundary walls , and trying to build a solid stack of bricks on top of a small house in the middle of a lake . a misplaced brick will teeter precariously , or perhaps even fall off , dragging other bricks with it , while you try to reach the target tower height before time runs out . it’s actually a refreshing twist on one of gaming’s most iconic formulas .\', \'adding some flavour to the premise are the different tasks you’re given as you progress , moving from survival mode , where you can only lose three bricks into the void before you fail , to puzzle mode , where you have to build your bricks into a particular shape . the puzzle mode also serves to make you think about brick placement , what works and what doesn’t , which is incredibly helpful as you progress further into the game .\', \'of course , any game that involves wizards is likely to feature some magic , and tricky towers isn’t about to buck that trend . as you’re building , you’re often faced with a wizard adversary who has power over all of the remaining bricks . from time to time he’ll attempt to stop you by performing various misdeeds , from expanding the size of bricks to ridiculous proportions to obscuring your view by causing vegetation to grow on your tower .\', \'in single player you can fire back with light magic , which ranges from making a solid stone block that won’t fall , to a block covered in vines that secures itself to those it’s placed next to , while multiplayer lets you choose between light and dark magic , as you reach certain milestones . however you’re playing , this can mean the difference between making it through and ignominious defeat , but in trying to wait for that pivotal moment , i would often miss my opportunity entirely .\', \'this could all be a match made in heaven , if not for the fact that there are some key problems , particularly when playing alone . the standard movement speed for your blocks is lethargic – unless an enemy wizard has sped things up , at which point , of course , it’s too fast – and you’ll feel like every press of the d - pad is a huge effort . mostly for you .\', \'once you’ve misplaced a brick , it’s nigh on impossible to come back from the way it contorts your tower , with the short play area meaning that once you’ve got one on an angle there’s probably nowhere else to go , and you’ll watch the next few bricks slide off into oblivion . you may envy them .\', \'combined with the repetitive music and sounds , the singleplayer mode can become a bit of a slog , with some unfair attacks from your adversary turning the closing moments of certain stages into pad endangering fury - fests .\', \'fortunately the local and online multiplayer is a great deal more fun . putting another human being or three into the mix makes everything take on a new aspect , and the random unfairness that the single player game exhibits disappears across the various different multiplayer modes . matches are often tense affairs , and the option of using your light magic to gain an extra life or take out a block comes up against the unerring urge to cause as much detriment to your opponents as possible . watching an array of pianos and oddly shaped windmills descend towards their towers is unequivocally satisfying .\', \'if you’re approaching tricky towers with only single player in mind , there are probably far better ways to spend your time . however , take it online – or ideally get some mates round – and you’ve suddenly got a fun , competitive little title that’ll easily keep you amused for a few hours .\', \'the puzzle levels aren’t about the shape . you’ve got to place all the bricks and keep them under a certain height . that possibly implies a certain shape ( low and wide ) , but it’s the height that matters .\', \'and the single player mode isn’t really unfair . it’s just challenging . first set of levels are fine . then it ramps up the difficulty quickly . by the time you’re on the 3rd set , it gets hard . depends on your personal skill , of course , but i’d say it’s just about on the limit between “stupidly hard , i give up” and “one more go and i’ll get it this time” .\', \'multiplayer is fun though . jumped into a game with 3 random online opponents and enjoyed it . you can be so far behind in race mode , and then the other towers fall and you’re in the lead , only to reach the line and find you can’t quite keep it up long enough and your tower comes crashing down after 2 seconds .\', \'a fun little ps + surprise then . 7 / 10 sounds about right .\', \'comment posted on 10 / 08 / 2016 at 09 : 24 .\', \'played it for a short while online , seemed fun but i didn’t see much incentive to continue to progress – if there are unlocks then they are not advertised .\', \'comment posted on 10 / 08 / 2016 at 09 : 45 .\', \'is “fun” not incentive enough to keep playing ? i guess there’s 3 trophies to get for playing it online .\', \'comment posted on 10 / 08 / 2016 at 09 : 52 .\', \'playstation 4 system software 6 . 00 is out now , but can you guess what it does ?\', \'bunimomike on playstation 4 system software 6 . 00 is out now , but can you guess what it does ?\', \'stefan l on playstation 4 system software 6 . 00 is out now , but can you guess what it does ?\', \'double -

shaped hole ( stop laughing dammit ) is timeless . and possibly difficult to reinvigorate for anyone who wants more of the same but packaged with some new paint on top of it . tricky towers is that game that attempts to do just that . by not being a tetris game at all .\', \'on the surface , the idea is simple : it’s tetris with a vertical goal and actual physics injected into the mix . and that makes for a tense , somewhat frustrating game . it’s not about scoring points with lines , but rather building a structure into the heavens itself that will most likely end up being flimsier than inquiry into political corruption . familiar blocks now present new challenges , especially those bastard z - shaped ones of either side . i hate , i hate them so damn much .\', \'it’s maddeningly captivating , building and watching your construction fall down like a house of cards , as tricky towers has a heavy reliance on the luck of the draw . much of this comes down to the trials in the single - player mode , as you stack and build across a wide variety of tests while some other little prick on the screen makes things more difficult for you with several challenges along the way .\', \'reaching certain thresholds does allow you to cast some magic to solidify your stairway to heaven as the clock counts down . with each successive trial passed , the puzzles only get harder and more devious , making the possibility of your wizard running out of life with a series of mishaps based on your poor building plan rather high and nigh .\', \'the real meat of tricky towers however is in the online modes available . players can challenge three pals or randoms and see just who the best builder is , unleashing dark magic to dick them about and bugger up their towers to your advantage . it’s easily the heart if tricky towers , and where most people will spend their time outside of the sole trials and endless modes available in single -

stomped .\', \'online is the mystery however , as the review copy we were provided with had just about zero presence in that digital multiplayer arena . i’ll take an educated guess and theorise that the experience will be largely similar , only with more cursing on the other end of your party line and chat .\', \'tricky towers is an okay single -

the game has 3 distinct multiplayer game modes : race , survival and puzzle . in the race game mode , players must compete to be the first to build a tower tall enough to pass the finish line . efficiency and construction speed are key to this game mode and it makes for a fast paced and frantic game experience . in survival , the player must try and place a certain number of bricks on their tower without dropping too many and losing their health . they must focus on careful construction and smart application of spells to triumph . the puzzle game mode is more slow paced compared to the other two . players need to try and place as many bricks on their tower as possible below a certain cut - off point . this requires a more creative style of play , as the player has to try and overcome the physics and come up with various engineering solutions .



there are also a number of single - player challenges available , where the player has to try and achieve a certain set of conditions depending on the challenge to succeed . there are also single - player versions of the survival and puzzle game modes where players compete for a high score , and the xbox version of the game has a single - player version of the race game mode .",tricky towers,"['html\n\n\n\nReview: Tricky Towers | PSNStores\n\n\n\n☰\n\n\n\nUpcoming\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nPS Vita\n\n\n\nPSM\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nMinis\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nPSVR\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nPS Vita\n\n\n\nPSM\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nMinis\n\n\n\nStore Updates\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nGameplay Glimpse\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\nUpcoming\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nPS Vita\n\n\n\nPSM\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nMinis\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nPSVR\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nPS Vita\n\n\n\nPSM\n\n\n\nPSP\n\n\n\nMinis\n\n\n\nStore Updates\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nGameplay Glimpse\n\n\n\nReview: Tricky Towers\n\n\n\nPosted by\n\n\n\nEric G\n\n\n\non August 2nd, 2016 |\n\n\n\n0 Comments\n\n\n\n| Tags:\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nWeird Beard Games\n\n\n\nTetrominoes have shown up in a good number of games since making their debut in Tetris back in 1984. Some notable PlayStation Network titles that make use of tetrominoes include the multiplayer tower-defense game Slam Bolt Scrappers and the single-player zen space RTS Rymdkapsel . Tricky Towers is the newest addition to bunch. Developed by WeirdBeard Games, a six person team from the Netherlands, Tricky Towers is a prime example of iterative design leading to a stellar ‘final’ product. As Brad accurately and humorously put it the first time he played it, Tricky Towers is the Dark Souls of Tetris games. After about a dozen hours with the game and a fierce, month long leaderboard back-and-forth, I have to say I agree with his sentiments.\n\n\n\nWeirdBeard first released a form of Tricky Towers in 2009, with a flash game titled 99 Bricks . The premise of the game was simple – you have 99 tetrominoes to build a tower that doesn’t fall over or lose any of its pieces. It takes the familiarity of Tetris and changes the objective a bit. Now, instead of getting rid of blocks, you want to build upward in a way that keeps all or some of your blocks from tipping over. All of a sudden, physics, architectural design, and suspense enter arena. In 2014, WeirdBeard released 99 Bricks: Wizard Academy for mobile devices. This retooled version of the game included a boatload of character along with a wide variety of quests to accomplish as you make your way through the ranks of tower-building wizardry. Wizard Academy is strategic, accessible, and fun. If you’re looking for a way to lose chunks of time on your smartphone, look no further. Tricky Towers adds a few new features to the mix, most notably multiplayer and dedicated game types.\n\n\n\nThe first thing that grabbed my attention about an early Tricky Towers trailer was the four-player multiplayer. I was a huge fan of Slam Bolt Scrappers when that released back in 2011, and the Tetris game that released on PSN that same year was incredible. Those games were most fun with a group of people playing together (locally in SBS ‘s case, online or offline in Tetris ‘s). The same can be said about Tricky Towers . There are three game types and three difficulties that can both be shuffled to create an endless slew of multiplayer delight. When I fired it up with three friends a few weeks back, we all went from complete noobs to fierce competitors in the span of about an hour. It was great having a game where prior skills didn’t play too much of a factor in who was the best. I’m pretty damn good at Tetris and wasn’t nearly winning as often as I expected to be. The game supports online multiplayer but since only a few of us are playing before release, I can’t really comment on what the experience/level-up system is all about. We didn’t have any problems getting into games together, though, which is a good sign.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the multiplayer madness, there’s also a fair bit of single-player content on display. Trials are split up into three different categories, which also make up the multiplayer modes. In Puzzle, you have predetermined starting platforms and a handful of tetrominoes to place below a laser. In the single-player trials, if you hit the laser, you lose. The challenge lies in somehow twisting and delicately placing all of the blocks into a space that seems altogether too small. In multplayer, touching the laser with a placed block boosts your entire tower upward, which is not a good thing. The player who can fit the most blocks underneath the laser is the winner. In Race, you aim to stack upward towards a floating checkered flag. In multiplayer, there are checkmarks where you receive light/dark magic spells to help/hurt yourself/your opponents. For example, the 2X Block dark magic spell causes opponents’ current blocks to inflate in size and weight. An example of a light magic spell would be the life-saving cement block, which sticks its landing and remains in place no matter how wobbly the rest of your ramshackle tower seems to be. There’s a great moment in Race when you realize you’re close to the flag. At this point, you start placing blocks on top of each other, reaching for the line and thus abandoning any sort of pride you have in your tower’s structural or aesthetic appeal, just hoping that it will stand for 3 seconds to grant you the win. Finally, there’s Survival, wherein your objective is to place a determined number of blocks without losing three lives. Each time you drop one, you lose a life. As simple as it sounds, it’s remarkably difficult to survive all the way through your inventory. The final single-player mode is one that Brad and I know all too well – Endless. In Endless, it’s all about how many bricks you can place. Every 10-20 seconds (Brad stopwatched it), a Wave hits that sends a new modifier (big blocks, locked rotation, fast drops, etc.) your way for a short while. Since we received vouchers for the game a few weeks back, we have been duking it out, climbing the leaderboards and stretching our abilities to untold heights. Here’s the part where I want to discuss addiction and randomness.\n\n\n\nI have definitely fallen victim to the charms of addictive games my fair share of times, losing hours upon hours in what are usually terribly repetitive acts. Tricky Towers is addictive. The Endless Mode in particular is crazy addictive. In the past month, I have regularly sat down to have just one go at beating Brad’s score only to find myself emerge, an hour and a half later, finally victorious or frustratingly unsuccessful. The music, which is perhaps my favorite part of the game, will likely have a cozy place in my brain for a long time coming due to the hours spent playing the same exact mode over and over. Here’s the rub – each run is relatively random. The tetrominoes you get and, more importantly, the Waves you must deal with, are random to a point that I think is beyond taming by skill only. I have gotten really good at this game ( even the devs say so ), but I’m still forced to play for over an hour for that one run where the Waves and tetriminoes aren’t too punishing. There’s so much good about this game that I can’t even dwell too heavily on this aspect, but it is irksome to have to rely on a roll of the proverbial dice in order to get a truly strong roll. If new content is added to the game, I hope an endless single-player mode that isn’t too reliant on luck is implemented. The trials are great, and the multiplayer is a blast, but there’s something so savagely competitive about leaderboard bouts that should not be hindered by chance.\n\n\n\nThere’s a joy to building something up only to watch it inevitably crumble that I think makes Jenga such a long-lasting novelty. It’s such an innate task – placing things atop each other to get as high as possible – that we practice from a young age, and that’s where the magic of Tricky Towers is derived from. It is challenging to build a freestanding edifice. There are shapes, counter-weights, and balancing that we have to constantly keep in mind when designing our masterpieces. What’s great is that there is fun to be had both in the process (building) and in the result (falling). I have never walked away from the game angry. Frustrated? Sometimes. But angry? Nope. Placing that final keystone to solidify my creation has always injected a dose of lightheartedness to the experience. If you like building in any capacity, or are looking for yet another top-notch multiplayer PSN game, Tricky Towers is for you.

They speculate wildly, somehow expecting that it’ll be some full retail release from a month ago and then, without fail, are gutted when it turns out to be some indie game that looks like it belongs on an iPhone.\n\n\n\nThis month we got Tricky Towers and it is far from being a full retail game. Just look at those screenshots. I get it, you didn’t buy a PS4 to play a cartoony version of Tetris. As such, I imagine a lot of people won’t even bother downloading this and that’s a shame, because Tricky Towers is decent.\n\n\n\nTo explain what it is, I have to put down the elephant in the room. This isn’t a Tetris clone. Sure, it uses tetromino pieces, the usual collection of four-piece blocks that you’re used to. But you don’t complete lines here and no blocks are taken away. Instead this is a game about stacking pieces.\n\n\n\nStarting from a solid base, your aim is generally to stack the falling pieces as high as possible. What makes this tricky, and makes Tricky Towers great, is the fact that the blocks are affected by physics and gravity. The weight of the blocks has to be considered. The best way to explain it is, imagine the line shaped tetramino (four blocks in a straight line). If you were putting that onto another block, it’d need at least 50% of it to be resting on the block below or else it will just topple off.\n\n\n\nSo, instead of rushing to get as high as possible, you really need to build firm, interlocking foundations. It becomes, no pun intended, a balancing act. When to stack versus when to solidify. It’s a clever game mechanic and really elevates the game beyond the usual slew of Tetris rip-offs we’ve seen over the years.\n\n\n\nThe game generally has three styles of play. You either build as high as possible, use as many blocks as possible or stay below a certain height limit. The latter option forming a puzzle mode where you try to tightly stack a set number of pieces while staying underneath a target line. This really teaches you the real way to play the game as you start learning how to predict the behaviour of structures.\n\n\n\nThe puzzle levels can be quite tricky, probably the hardest levels in the game, but they are still quite enjoyable but, for me at least, the modes where you try to build as big a tower as possible are the most fun.\n\n\n\nAside from 50 single-player levels and an endless mode, the game also has local and online multiplayer modes. With this being a freebie, the game is well-populated online and, despite usually sacking off anything that involves playing with randoms, I’m properly loving playing this online. There are no lag issues at all and the three game modes (puzzle, race and survival) are all enjoyable.\n\n\n\nThe game’s simplicity is an issue. Yes, it’s a bit different to the usual Tetris or match-three puzzlers you usually get, but this is still a puzzle game and so that might put some people off and the simple presentation isn’t going to turn any heads (although to be fair you don’t really want the graphics getting in the way of this sort of thing).\n\n\n\nHowever, when it comes to addictiveness, the game has it in spades. The trophies deserve a mention too as they are genuinely challenging and going for them will improve your overall game.\n\n\n\nBeyond that there isn’t much else to say. The physics aspect adds a really nice twist to the usual puzzle gameplay but if you’re not a fan of the genre, this maybe isn’t the game for you. As far as prices go, you can’t beat free. So give Tricky Towers a go, especially online, and you might find yourself unable to put it down.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nOverall\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\n\n+ Physics elements add a really nice extra element to the Tetris-esque gameplay. + Good choice of online modes, and decent netcode. + Challenging trophies. + Hyper addictive gameplay. + Free (in August 2016).\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\n- Quite a simple concept, so the flavour may wear off eventually. - Presentation is pretty simplistic.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nTricky Towers may look like the sort of unwanted freebie that PS+ owners have been bemoaning for years but this is good.

Alongside this formula, physics-based puzzle games have maintained popularity in the form of both flash games on the web and on other platforms. In 2009, developer WeirdBeard Games released a physics-based puzzler with Tetris elements called 99 Bricks . Seven years later, WeirdBeard released Tricky Towers , a game that expands on 99 Bricks ’ tower-building premise by adding more modes and emphasising competitive play. Does this new tower-building puzzler stack up? Let’s find out.\n\n\n\nUpon playing your first round of Tricky Towers , you’ll immediately notice that the blocks falling from the top of the screen are extremely reminiscent of those found in Tetris . Similar still is that you are expected to interlock these falling blocks to create a study structure, free of gaps and instabilities. What you’ll notice, however, is that there are no walls to protect your bricks from falling. The built-in physics emphasise the need for quick but careful construction. Build a sloppy structure and, guaranteed, it will come crumbling down.\n\n\n\nBuilding your tower is not all you have to focus on, though. You play as a wizard and, while constructing your own tower, you will acquire light and dark spells to help yourself and harm your foes, respectively. For example, some light spells may remove the most recent block you placed or create a floating surface for you to start building anew. Dark spells may force your opponents to place a super-sized block or make it so their block falls at an excruciatingly slow pace. Spells add a layer of interaction between players that makes a traditionally isolated building experience feel all the more connected.\n\n\n\nThree game modes are available in both single-player and multiplayer (local and online) modes: puzzle, race and survival. Puzzle mode provides you with predetermined blocks that you must fit in carefully without making contact with a laser hanging slightly above. Race is as you would expect; you must be the fastest at creating a tall enough tower to reach a hanging checkered line. In survival, players are given three lives to build a tower larger than those made by their opponents. If a brick falls, a life is lost. Each game mode is genuinely enjoyable, and having modes that require different speeds of play and forms of strategy is an excellent way to keep players coming back for more.\n\n\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent that single-player is not the way that Tricky Towers is meant to be played. Playing alone feels lonely and sluggish, and it brings attention to some of the game’s flaws. For example, the music and sounds in single-player are largely repetitive and uninteresting. The difficulty spike in single-player is also jarring. Single-player does have one additional mode that is extremely alluring, however: Endless mode. Endless mode is as you would expect: place as many blocks as you can without having your tower crumble. While building your tower, you must endure frequent waves of modifiers that negatively impact your building prowess. These modifiers appear randomly, and while the randomness may irritate those trying to climb the leaderboards, they never stopped me from wanting to try just one more time.\n\n\n\nI feel the need to emphasize this: this game is, without a doubt, meant to be played in multiplayer . Whether it’s with three friends on the couch or with strangers online, Tricky Towers is, in every way, better as a party game. Building your own tower feels instantly more chaotic as you glance over to see how your opponents are doing. Just as you get confident that you’ll take home the victory, one of your opponents casts dark magic to ruin your lead (and quite possibly your mood). I found myself playing for hours with complete strangers and, win or lose, I had an absolute blast. Rounds also often finish quickly enough so that early crumblers won’t have to wait long to get in on the next match. Gameplay also always felt goofy and light-hearted, which was likely due in part to the charming cartoony aesthetic. Colours are vivid and wizard characters look downright silly, adding to the feel-good nature that Tricky Towers exudes.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers is one of the free games available for PlayStation Plus in August 2016. If you’re a Plus member and you haven’t yet downloaded this fantastic party game, I highly recommend that you do so quickly. Even if you’re not a Plus member, this game is certainly worthwhile if you have some friends that fancy a solid physics-based puzzle game. WeirdBeard Games should be commended for creating such a simple, yet charming arcade puzzle game. Its single-player mode is useful for familiarising yourself with the game, but this is, undeniably, a multiplayer spectacle. Don’t take its cartoony appearance lightly; Tricky Towers could very well be the game that has you laughing and screaming with (or at) your friends for a long time to come.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers is available on PS4 and PC.

So it is then that we can happily add one more to those hallowed ranks, in the form of Tricky Towers from splendidly named Amsterdam-based developer WeirdBeard.\n\n\n\nTetris X Jenga\n\n\n\nThe first thing you need to know is that Tricky Towers both looks and plays like the spawn of Tetris and Jenga which is not a bad thing at all, though inconceivably staunch haters of either the latter or the former will certainly struggle to enjoy Tricky Towers’ base premise. For everyone else, you’ll be relieved to know that the game plays extremely familiarly for the most part, in so far as you have different coloured blocks that tumble down the screen which must be rotated and shuffled into place to fashion a colourful tower of awe-inspiring glory.\n\n\n\nImmediately however, veteran Tetris players will notice that something is amiss; some cheeky rascal has only gone and applied a physics system to the whole thing and in the most literal terms, it is an absolute game-changer. Rather than being able to position blocks absolutely as has always been the case with Tetris and the numerous clones which have followed in its wake, Tricky Towers has blocks that wobble, tumble and fall depending however they’ve been positioned and as you can rightly imagine, this adds a whole new dimension to the proceedings that makes Tricky Towers feel like a proper hybrid of Tetris and Jenga.\n\n\n\nFaulty Towers\n\n\n\nAccompanying the absolute bedlam that this new physics system permits are the light and dark magic spells that are available in each match, because you see, rather than being some disembodied block manipulating deity, players are actually cast as a nutty little wizard who has the ability to both enhance their own blocking-dropping prospects whilst also disrupting those of their opponents. In terms of the light spells which can aid your own progression, these include such useful summonings as magnets that help your blocks stick together and lightning bolts that can destroy troublesome placed blocks to name just a couple.\n\n\n\nOver on the A-hole side of the magical fence, dark spells can properly screw up the momentum of opposing players by doing everything from making supermassive (and thus horrendously hard to place) versions of their falling blocks appear to tying balloons around the blocks and thus preventing their accelerated descent. In short, there is no shortage of ways to annoy your fellow player; just expect such shenanigans to be returned in kind because, well, that’s all part of the fun.\n\n\n\nAnd what fun it is. Playing contrary to Tetris’ traditionally slow starting pace, multiplayer games in Tricky Towers are frequently a riot, fuelled as they are by the broad objectives of the various game modes and of course, the naturally frantic escapades of trying to outdo your foes with whatever spells are at your disposal.\n\n\n\n@page\n\n\n\nSpeaking of those various modes, Tricky Towers supports a trio of different game types; race, puzzle and survival across single-player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer configurations. Of the three, survival sticks closest to the original Tetris format, though race and puzzle are arguably far more interesting. In the case of the latter, players are given a specific number of blocks that must be arranged in such a way that they don’t creep over a predetermined line, with the first person to arrange their blocks correctly without exhausting their three lives being deemed the winner. By placing a premium simultaneously on both logic and speed, the gradually more difficult puzzles excel as both brilliantly intense brain-teasers and also as prime competitive material in a way that very few other games can offer.\n\n\n\nIn regards to the race mode, Tricky Towers embraces a different sort of intensity as players rush to build a tower as quickly as possible in order to reach a finish line suspended high in the sky. The kicker to this though, is that it isn’t enough to just stack a rickety arrangement of skyward pointed blocks to reach the finish line because the tower must be able to stand above the finish line for a full three seconds in order for the player to be declared the victor. As you can well imagine then, such matches are furiously contested affairs that elicit as many laughs and raucous whoops as just about any other multiplayer game available on PS4.\n\n\n\nIf anything, it’s a shame that there aren’t more game modes on offer. With the level of imagination evident in the design of the puzzle and race levels, WeirdBeard has opened the door to a reimagining of a classic formula that could still go in a number of different directions, so here’s hoping that any future content which may, or may not, be in development for the game includes more content in this vein.\n\n\n\nIn Summary\n\n\n\nIn a time when local multiplayer efforts aren’t really known for taxing the cerebrum, it’s refreshing to see one such effort that does exactly that. A confident evolution of Alexey Pajitnov’s 1984 classic Tetris, Tricky Towers augments the founding compelling principles of that landmark title with some entertaining game modes, and a fiendishly sly selection of game-changing spells. Despite such advancements however, Tricky Towers’ appeal remains firmly rooted with those who found joy with Pajitnov’s block-dropping puzzler all those years ago and as such, newcomers may struggle to embrace its substantial, though subversive charm.\n\n\n\nScore\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nThe Final Word\n\n\n\nNot just an exceptional title that breathes fresh life into the traditional Tetris formula, Tricky Towers also gives a great account of itself for those folks looking to test their brains rather than their trigger fingers in both local and online multiplayer gatherings.\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\nhtml PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd""\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nThe Sinking City Visual Storytelling Featurette Released\n\n\n\nJohn-Paul Jones / September 13, 2018\n\n\n\nCheck out the latest video featurette from developer Frogwares on its newest game The Sinking City, as it explains how the visuals support the madness.\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\nhtml PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd""\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nBattlefield V Character Customization Will Be More Authentic Following Fan Feedback\n\n\n\nChante Williamson / September 13, 2018\n\n\n\nSince the unveiling of Battlefield V earlier this year, fans have been in dispute about the authenticity of of some …\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\nhtml PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd""\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nPixelJunk Monsters 2 Update 1.03 Patch Notes Confirm New Weekly Stages\n\n\n\nSimon Sayers / September 13, 2018\n\n\n\nTower defense game PixelJunk Monsters 2 is getting a major patch today.

In fact, Weirdbeard Games probably took a long hard look at the most successful titles of all time and thought “Tetris… no one’s bettered that yet!”, and decided to have a go themselves. Tricky Towers doesn’t have the purity, or likely the longevity of Tetris, but there is fun to be had with it, as long as you’ve got a friend or three on hand.\n\n\n\nSingle player content either takes the form of a series of trials which ramp up across five difficulty levels, or an Endless mode which does exactly what it sounds like. As you start, you choose from a cute wizard-y type whose magic you’re relying on to build your tricky tower, and tricky is definitely the operative word.\n\n\n\nImagine playing Tetris without its left and right boundary walls, and trying to build a solid stack of bricks on top of a small house in the middle of a lake. A misplaced brick will teeter precariously, or perhaps even fall off, dragging other bricks with it, while you try to reach the target tower height before time runs out. It’s actually a refreshing twist on one of gaming’s most iconic formulas.\n\n\n\nAdding some flavour to the premise are the different tasks you’re given as you progress, moving from survival mode, where you can only lose three bricks into the void before you fail, to puzzle mode, where you have to build your bricks into a particular shape. The puzzle mode also serves to make you think about brick placement, what works and what doesn’t, which is incredibly helpful as you progress further into the game.\n\n\n\nOf course, any game that involves wizards is likely to feature some magic, and Tricky Towers isn’t about to buck that trend. As you’re building, you’re often faced with a wizard adversary who has power over all of the remaining bricks. From time to time he’ll attempt to stop you by performing various misdeeds, from expanding the size of bricks to ridiculous proportions to obscuring your view by causing vegetation to grow on your tower.\n\n\n\nIn single player you can fire back with light magic, which ranges from making a solid stone block that won’t fall, to a block covered in vines that secures itself to those it’s placed next to, while multiplayer lets you choose between light and dark magic, as you reach certain milestones. However you’re playing, this can mean the difference between making it through and ignominious defeat, but in trying to wait for that pivotal moment, I would often miss my opportunity entirely.\n\n\n\nThis could all be a match made in heaven, if not for the fact that there are some key problems, particularly when playing alone. The standard movement speed for your blocks is lethargic – unless an enemy wizard has sped things up, at which point, of course, it’s too fast – and you’ll feel like every press of the D-pad is a huge effort. Mostly for you.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve misplaced a brick, it’s nigh on impossible to come back from the way it contorts your tower, with the short play area meaning that once you’ve got one on an angle there’s probably nowhere else to go, and you’ll watch the next few bricks slide off into oblivion. You may envy them.\n\n\n\nCombined with the repetitive music and sounds, the singleplayer mode can become a bit of a slog, with some unfair attacks from your adversary turning the closing moments of certain stages into pad endangering fury-fests.\n\n\n\nFortunately the local and online multiplayer is a great deal more fun. Putting another human being or three into the mix makes everything take on a new aspect, and the random unfairness that the single player game exhibits disappears across the various different multiplayer modes. Matches are often tense affairs, and the option of using your light magic to gain an extra life or take out a block comes up against the unerring urge to cause as much detriment to your opponents as possible. Watching an array of pianos and oddly shaped windmills descend towards their towers is unequivocally satisfying.\n\n\n\nWhat’s Good:\n\n\n\nMultiplayer is a lot of fun\n\n\n\nThe core Tetris-eque building is solid\n\n\n\nDifferent modes add variety\n\n\n\nWhat’s Bad:\n\n\n\nSingle player is unfair\n\n\n\nToo much emphasis on random factors\n\n\n\nSlow brick movement\n\n\n\nIf you’re approaching Tricky Towers with only single player in mind, there are probably far better ways to spend your time. However, take it online – or ideally get some mates round – and you’ve suddenly got a fun, competitive little title that’ll easily keep you amused for a few hours.\n\n\n\nScore: 7/10\n\n\n\nVersion Tested: PS4\n\n\n\nRead more: # Tricky Towers\n\n\n\n3 Comments\n\n\n\nMrYd\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\n\nSince: Mar 2011\n\n\n\nThe puzzle levels aren’t about the shape. You’ve got to place all the bricks and keep them under a certain height. That possibly implies a certain shape (low and wide), but it’s the height that matters.\n\n\n\nAnd the single player mode isn’t really unfair. It’s just challenging. First set of levels are fine. Then it ramps up the difficulty quickly. By the time you’re on the 3rd set, it gets hard. Depends on your personal skill, of course, but I’d say it’s just about on the limit between “stupidly hard, I give up” and “One more go and I’ll get it this time”.\n\n\n\nMultiplayer is fun though. Jumped into a game with 3 random online opponents and enjoyed it. You can be so far behind in race mode, and then the other towers fall and you’re in the lead, only to reach the line and find you can’t quite keep it up long enough and your tower comes crashing down after 2 seconds.\n\n\n\nA fun little PS+ surprise then. 7/10 sounds about right.\n\n\n\nComment posted on 10/08/2016 at 09:24.\n\n\n\nPermalink\n\n\n\nTuffcub\n\n\n\nOn the naughty step.\n\n\n\nSince: Dec 2008\n\n\n\nPlayed it for a short while online, seemed fun but I didn’t see much incentive to continue to progress – if there are unlocks then they are not advertised.\n\n\n\nComment posted on 10/08/2016 at 09:45.\n\n\n\nPermalink\n\n\n\nMrYd\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\n\nSince: Mar 2011\n\n\n\nIs “fun” not incentive enough to keep playing?

I won! I are good now!”\n\n\n\nComment posted on 10/08/2016 at 09:52.\n\n\n\nPermalink\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\n\nTricky Towers Coming To Xbox One Later In 2017\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\n\nWhat We Played #266 No Man’s Sky, Tricky Towers & Worms WMD\n\n\n\nTricky Towers Review\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\n\nAugust’s PS Plus Update Features Tricky Towers & Rebel Galaxy\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\n\nSony Digital Showcase Round Up: Alienation, Edith Finch, Kick Off & Tricky Towers\n\n\n\nOctober\n\n\n\nTricky Towers Announced For PlayStation 4\n\n\n\nWarhammer: Chaosbane Gets A Gameplay Trailer\n\n\n\n1 hour ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nPlayStation 4 System Software 6.00 Is Out Now, But Can You Guess What It Does?\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nState Of Decay 2\'s Daybreak DLC Is Out Now\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nPayday 4 Dead – Hands On With Overkill’s The Walking Dead\n\n\n\n3 hours ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nAlan Wake To Become A Live Action TV Series\n\n\n\n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nForza Horizon 4\'s Demo Is Out Now, And Bond Themed DLC Has Been Revealed\n\n\n\n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nAzure Reflections Review\n\n\n\n6 hours ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nUbisoft Show Off Hovercraft Racing From The Crew 2: Gator Rush Update\n\n\n\n6 hours ago\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nThe News At Sixth: 12/09/18\n\n\n\n21 hours ago\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nAssetto Corsa Competizione Is Reinventing Kunos’ Sim Racer\n\n\n\n22 hours ago\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nLatest Comments\n\n\n\nbunimomike on PlayStation 4 System Software 6.00 Is Out Now, But Can You Guess What It Does?\n\n\n\nStefan L on PlayStation 4 System Software 6.00 Is Out Now, But Can You Guess What It Does?\n\n\n\ndouble-o-dave on PlayStation 4 System Software 6.00 Is Out Now, But Can You Guess What It Does?\n\n\n\nTuffcub on PlayStation 4 System Software 6.00 Is Out Now, But Can You Guess What It Does?\n\n\n\nron_mcphatty on PlayStation 4 System Software 6.00 Is Out Now, But Can You Guess What It Does?\n\n\n\ndouble-o-dave on Ciri To Be Played By BAME Actress In The Netflix Series, Showrunner Leaves Twitter Due To Backlash\n\n\n\nMrYd on PlayStation 4 System Software 6.00 Is Out Now, But Can You Guess What It Does?\n\n\n\nTuffcub on Ciri To Be Played By BAME Actress In The Netflix Series, Showrunner Leaves Twitter Due To Backlash\n\n\n\ntonyyeb on Assetto Corsa Competizione Is Reinventing Kunos’ Sim Racer\n\n\n\nTuffcub on PlayStation 4 System Software 6.00 Is Out Now, But Can You Guess What It Does?\n\n\n\nStefan L on Assetto Corsa Competizione Is Reinventing Kunos’ Sim Racer\n\n\n\ntonyyeb on Assetto Corsa Competizione Is Reinventing Kunos’ Sim Racer\n\n\n\nthesixthaxis - an oscar mike media joint\n\n\n\nWe do not license content or design to any other site.

To throw in a little spice, you can also use magic spells, both light and dark magic, to improve your tower or interfere with your opponents. The game style will feel familiar, as it feels influenced by games such as Jenga and Tetris .\n\n\n\nAllowing you to play locally or online, Tricky Towers is a fabulous puzzle game, made for players who want to test their brains more than their reaction time. Unfortunately, I fall in to the latter category, so this game was my own personal form of masochism. ‘Why yes, I would love to play this Tetris-like puzzle game even though I couldn’t do more than 5 lines without messing it up as a child.’ The unwritten rule of at least trying your best if you are unable to complete a game before the review deadline date was one that greatly affected me over the week and ended up with me feeling like the biggest loser in the world as I lost the majority of games I played.\n\n\n\nThe most important thing to do whilst playing this game is to keep fighting til the end. You might think that someone is miles ahead of you, but one bad brick can knock their whole tower down. I don’t feel as though this game is for just anyone, rather it has a niche market of people who just love puzzle games. The ideal market are people who enjoyed puzzle games during their Nintendo DS prime and feel the recent void left in the market. Of course, you could just play Tetris, but the online factor is where this game comes in to its own league. This game does not have a long life ahead of it, but I think it is here for a good time, not a long time.\n\n\n\nThere are different modes: race, survival, puzzle and random. Each of these modes are fun, but the most fun to watch as a spectator is race. Watching the different ways people try to race to the top is funny, as some people try and get them to fit neatly on top of each other and others just dump the bricks on top of each other at speed, so that even when the bricks tip over, there is still a chance they will win. Random is a great way to keep things interesting, as you can quickly learn other peoples tactics and see how the winners play. Going against your friends after learning from who seem like the smartest people in the world, can really be an ego booster when your friends cannot work out the controls faster than you can build a tower.\n\n\n\nThe heartbreak you feel as your tower falls is not one to be taken lightly, as it feels like when your pull down the Jenga tower, multiplied by ten million. Especially when you were having a good run not two seconds before and your tower was reaching skyscraper status. Watching your friends smug faces are painful as they pull a magic trick that makes your tower collapse.\n\n\n\nThe colour palettes are nice and colourful, the bricks are a mix of primary and secondary colours and the backgrounds are always aesthetically pleasing. The soundtrack is nice and light, nothing special, but I do not think anyone was expecting it to be. Overall, Tricky Towers is a nice and fun game, which will give you a lot of fun, specifically at parties. With a couple of drinks involved, this game will be a hit. Considering it is one of this months PlayStation Plus games, there is no better time than the present to download it.\n\n\n\nREVIEW CODE: A complimentary Sony Playstation 4 code was provided to Brash Games for this review.

But for the rest of the planet? Tetris is a part of our culture, an idea backed up by a catchy piece of music that has spawned numerous sequels on just about any gaming platform.\n\n\n\nThe idea of fitting blocks into the right-shaped hole (STOP LAUGHING DAMMIT) is timeless. And possibly difficult to reinvigorate for anyone who wants more of the same but packaged with some new paint on top of it. Tricky Towers is that game that attempts to do just that. By not being a Tetris game at all.\n\n\n\nOn the surface, the idea is simple: It’s Tetris with a vertical goal and actual physics injected into the mix. And that makes for a tense, somewhat frustrating game. It’s not about scoring points with lines, but rather building a structure into the heavens itself that will most likely end up being flimsier than inquiry into political corruption. Familiar blocks now present new challenges, especially those bastard z-shaped ones of either side. I hate, I hate them so damn much.\n\n\n\nIt’s maddeningly captivating, building and watching your construction fall down like a house of cards, as Tricky Towers has a heavy reliance on the luck of the draw. Much of this comes down to the Trials in the single-player mode, as you stack and build across a wide variety of tests while some other little prick on the screen makes things more difficult for you with several challenges along the way.\n\n\n\nRead\n\n\n\nWhere to easily find every bounty target and Lost Sector in Destiny 2: Forsaken\n\n\n\nReaching certain thresholds does allow you to cast some magic to solidify your stairway to heaven as the clock counts down. With each successive trial passed, the puzzles only get harder and more devious, making the possibility of your wizard running out of life with a series of mishaps based on your poor building plan rather high and nigh.\n\n\n\nThe real meat of Tricky Towers however is in the online modes available. Players can challenge three pals or randoms and see just who the best builder is , unleashing dark magic to dick them about and bugger up their towers to your advantage. It’s easily the heart if Tricky Towers, and where most people will spend their time outside of the sole Trials and Endless modes available in single-player.\n\n\n\nAs the kind of game you’d tackle for a few minutes during a lunchbreak, it’ll probably be perfect as a short experience when augmented with one of several different match-types. That’s for local battle at least, because anything longer than a quick ten minute session will probably result in somebody getting groin-stomped.\n\n\n\nOnline is the mystery however, as the review copy we were provided with had just about zero presence in that digital multiplayer arena. I’ll take an educated guess and theorise that the experience will be largely similar, only with more cursing on the other end of your party line and chat.\n\n\n\nLast Updated:\n\n\n\nJuly 27, 2016\n\n\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nTricky Towers is an okay single-player game, but you’re going to want this Tetris-inspired skyscraper builder for some couch co-op. It’s easy enough to grasp, but it’d be a whole lot more satisfying if the balance of the game wasn’t heavily favouring the luck of the draw over actual player skill.\n\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n\nTricky Towers was reviewed on PlayStation 4\n\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\n\n\nShare on Google+\n\n\n\nShare on Reddit\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n\n\nShare on Linkedin\n\n\n\nPrevious article\n\n\n\nIn Other News – 27 July 2016\n\n\n\nNext article\n\n\n\nFaZed and Confused Part 3–Making it Rain\n\n\n\nDarryn Bonthuys\n\n\n\nSomething wrong gentlemen?

At first glance it looks like a Tetris variant, and for a moment I was fooled into thinking that perhaps a new version of the game was coming out on PlayStation 4 that I didn\'t know about.\n\n\n\nUpon further inspection, though, it turns out that while the game does indeed initially look and play like Tetris, it\'s not really Tetris at all. It\'s ultimately a competitive tower-building game. Tetrads that are the same shape as the ones in Tetris fall from the sky, and the objective is to pile them on top of one another to create an edifice as quickly as possible. That sounds easy enough, right? Just a case of dropping pieces down the screen and piling them up to win? Well, it\'s not – and here\'s where Tricky Towers\' excellent twist comes into play.\n\n\n\nTetrads can indeed be positioned on top of one another in the usual Tetris fashion, and as you pile them up, the game plays pretty much like Alexy Pajitnov\'s classic – except that lines of blocks don\'t disappear when you complete them. However, the pieces don\'t actually stick together like they do in Tetris – they\'re governed by gravity, so that if a piece is protruding too far from your column, or you don\'t match pieces together perfectly, they\'ll start to fall. This can create chain reactions that result in your tower destabilizing, and perhaps even falling apart completely if you manage to unbalance it.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers is primarily a multiplayer competitive game that can be played by up to four players locally or online across three different modes. In Race mode, the objective is to simply pile up your pieces as quickly as possible and be the first past the finish line some way up the screen. However, adding an extra dimension to the gameplay is your wizard who floats near your tower. As your heap of tetrads grows, you receive spells that can give you an advantage, perhaps turning a piece of your tower into a solid mass that can defy gravity, or binding pieces together to form a bigger, more stable whole. Sometimes you\'ll be awarded a spell that can be used against other players, for example, by adding a giant piece into their tetrad rotation that\'s really difficult to position on their tower.\n\n\n\nSurvivor mode is a little different. Here you have to build a stable tower and last as long as possible without pieces dropping off your building. Every time they do, you lose a life, and when three batches of pieces have fallen, you’re out of the game. As in Race mode, you have access to the same kinds of offensive and defensive spells that let you strategically strengthen your tower, or mess with your opponent respectively, further adding to the competitive fun.\n\n\n\nFinally, there\'s puzzle mode, in which you have to build a tower that\'s as wide as possible without dropping any bricks. This is definitely the trickiest of the three multiplayer modes, as well as the quickest. Games can be over in short order if you build your tower too high, or you fail to make a stable base and your pieces topple to the ground.\n\n\n\nAll three multiplayer modes are exceptionally easy to pick up and play, and that\'s largely the beauty of this game. It\'s simple, but great fun, and gives rise to highly satisfying ""gotcha"" moments, especially when you do something like drop a giant piece on an opponent at a key moment when they\'re nearing the finishing line, causing their tower to collapse. However, the same thing can happen to you, of course, and this delivers some great back-and-forth during matches that can really make the proceedings riotously entertaining. Tricky Towers is nicely designed in that respect to make competition fierce, but fun – making it a great party game because pretty much anyone can play.\n\n\n\nAs well as a multiplayer mode, Tricky Towers features a single-player option that\'s also enjoyable – even if it does get very challenging over time. There are 50 different puzzles in all, and they\'re arranged in five sets of 10, four of which are locked when the game begins. To unlock the next set of puzzles, you need to finish any eight of the prior challenges.\n\n\n\nThere are three different flavors of puzzles, which bear some passing similarities to the three multiplayer modes. There\'s a challenge where you have to build a tower as quickly as possible and reach the finishing point before the timer expires. Another is similar to survival, where you have to build a tower using a certain number of pieces. If they fall, and you lose all three of your lives, the round ends. Finally, there\'s a challenge where you have to use all the pieces at your disposal to erect an edifice that fits beneath a certain height. If you can place all the pieces without breaking the height barrier, you win the round.\n\n\n\nWhile I was entertained by the single-player mode, I did also find it a little frustrating. The first two sets of puzzles are fairly straightforward, but once you reach the third set and beyond, they start getting very hard – and some of the puzzles seem to rely on luck to get past them. Not so much the ones where you\'re building a low tower – those puzzles are all about skill, since you always get the same tetrads to play with every time, and it\'s just a case of learning where you need to put the pieces to complete the challenge – but definitely with the other two. The problem is that if you get the right pieces at the right time, you can breeze through a challenge, but most of the time luck isn\'t with you, and you have to deal with pieces that are a nightmare to place within your tower, resulting in your tower destabilizing and/or falling. This makes the single-player mode somewhat hit-and-miss. Sure, it\'s fun trying to complete all the puzzles, but the random element can just make the process annoying, especially when you have a long series of games in a row where you have repeated bad luck.\n\n\n\nFortunately, though, this problem doesn\'t impact the multiplayer side of the game, which remains Tricky Towers\' strength. Whether you\'re playing online or locally, the game delivers intense and thoroughly enjoyable PvP contests that are highly entertaining. While I don\'t necessarily think Tricky Towers is the sort of thing you\'ll play for hours on end, it is really addictive in short bursts, making it an ideal party game, or something to dip in and out of when you have spare time – especially if you have friends or family to play with.\n\n\n\nThe single-player aspect of Tricky Towers is challenging, but can get rather frustrating due to its random elements. However, as a multiplayer game, Tricky Towers works really well. Its tower-building gameplay is incredibly easy to pick up and play, and it delivers fierce and fun competition that offers plenty of ways for players to mess with one another. Definitely recommended as a party game, or if you have friends and family to play with.\n\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n/5\n\n\n\nTricky Towers PS4 Review: Competitive Tower Building with Tetrads\n\n\n\nJaz Rignall\n\n\n\nTricky Towers looks like a Tetris game at first glance, but it\'s not really Tetris at all.\n\n\n\n2016-07-27T15:30:00-04:00\n\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nThis article may contain links to online retail stores.

Tricky Towers , a physics-based tower-builder in which up to four players can compete both offline and online, may not be a particularly amazing addition to the console\'s catalogue of local multiplayer games, but dedicated puzzle fans should get some fun out of it.\n\n\n\nIn essence, Tricky Towers is essentially multiplayer Tetris , except the blocks (or Tetrominoes) are affected by physics, and therefore your tower can collapse, leading to some particularly tense situations in multiplayer. There\'s also a bit of spell-casting thrown in to keep things interesting: light spells are focused on strengthening your own tower – such as petrifying one of the bricks in it in order to keep it rock solid – while dark spells are used to throw a spanner in the works of your opponents, like changing one of their bricks into a random object or enlarging their next piece so that it\'s harder to place.\n\n\n\nThese special abilities help make Tricky Towers a fun multiplayer game – there\'s the decision of whether to help yourself or hinder your opponent, as well as the fact that you\'ll have to focus extra-hard on placing your blocks since they\'re affected by physics and forces. It\'s a game that\'s very easy to pick up and play, and although it doesn\'t have much replay value and does get a little stale over time, it does make for a good party game every now and again.\n\n\n\nThere are three modes in multiplayer: Race, in which the winner is the player who builds the highest tower in the allotted time; Survival, where you lose a life every time one of your blocks falls; Puzzle, in which you\'re given a set number of blocks, and must build a tower that doesn\'t go over a certain height. Survival is the flagship mode of the multiplayer, one that\'s both slow and tactical, yet has pockets of bedlam whenever players cast their spells. One more mode wouldn\'t have gone amiss, as the trio do eventually get stale after repeated bursts of playing.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers starts to lose its thunder in single player, however. Since the spell-casting is what makes the multiplayer matches interesting, the fact that it\'s omitted in single player makes it a largely boring affair, as it\'s essentially the multiplayer except the AI casts spells on you and you can\'t fight back, leading to some frustration. The Endless mode is appreciated, though it\'s hardly likely that you\'d want to play the game by yourself for so long, as the multiplayer is far more fun.\n\n\n\nThe game has a cutesy aesthetic, with the wizard designs and background drawings being charismatic in particular, but one really annoying part of the game is the menu screens. Every time you move to a different button, a bongo drum sounds, which is particularly irritating when you\'re scrolling through menus and your ears fill with the sound of an angry monkey in a room full of drums. It\'s only a minor qualm, though.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nTricky Towers is a good romp when playing local multiplayer with friends – the floppy physics add tension (both literally and metaphorically) and the spells make the gameplay interesting and dynamic. The gameplay suffers quite a bit in single player, though, and even though the price is cheap, the game does wear thin eventually.\n\n\n\nNot Bad\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nScoring Policy Review copy provided by WeirdBeard\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nStats:\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nSam Brooke\n\n\n\nSam has a borderline crazy love for indie games, and is often found scouring the back alleys of the PlayStation Store for his next hit.

Weirdbeard Games’ take on the tetronomino formula – mobile game 99 bricks – you’re not trying to make your lines disappear, you’re trying to build them up, and sometimes it’s very good, but it can also be just plain annoying.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers\n\n\n\nis basically a home version of Weirdbeard’s 99 bricks and sees you as a cloud riding wizard tasked with turning falling blocks into a structure that can stand on its own. A rival wizard sits watching your progress and throws in the odd curveball to try and put you off while you attempt to create a tower matching theirs.\n\n\n\nThis not being the 80s any more there needs to be another twist on the block stacking formula, and here it’s the fact that each block has its own weight properties, you lay it down on a flat point on a flat edge and it’s sit there fine, but the smaller the surface area; the more chance it’ll be toppled, and as the tower becomes higher the more unstable it becomes. Anyone who has played Jenga or tried to build a house of cards will be instantly familiar with the idea. You’ll need to make sure you displace weight evenly across each level to prevent the tower leaning to one side and collapsing. Watching your carefully constructed tower fall is a sight you’ll see on a regular basis, and it never gets any less frustrating.\n\n\n\nIn single player there are three separate game modes which rotate constantly as you go through them. You have the aforementioned straight build, where you have to build up to a certain height within an extremely strict time limit. There’s one where you have to fit all the pieces under a low barrier, turning the game into a jigsaw puzzle. Finally the last mode is a variation on the straight build where the rival wizard will use more powers to put you off; like obscuring your view, or turning pieces into parts of a building.\n\n\n\nMaking the pieces themselves balance when you’ve been thrown an odd shape is hard enough, but it’s the powers of the enemy wizards that are exceedingly unfair. Some stop you from rotating the piece, others make them gigantic, and one excruciating one sees the pieces drop at an alarmingly fast rate. This can quickly lead to a failed build and a frustrated restart over and over again. With each loss a cruel, sadistic high pitch laughs fills the air as your opponent knows they have bettered you, and before long that laugh will be burned into your brain and you’ll be hearing it everywhere.\n\n\n\nYou have powers to help you, but it’s never explained what they do, or how they’ll benefit you in your building endeavours. There’s no tutorial, nothing to teach you advanced techniques; you’re just thrown in and expected to fend for yourself. If there’s one thing Tricky Towers is consistent with, it’s the unrelenting disdain for the person playing it.\n\n\n\nOutside of the single player you have your standard competitive multiplayer option, and that’s about it. There isn’t really much more to talk about in the game at all. It’s all held together in a threadbare menu system that at the very least looks like it fits in with the theme of poorly put together blocks.\n\n\n\nTricky Towers doesn’t do what a good puzzle game should do: it doesn’t make you feel dumb for a while before things finally click and you then feel smart. No, it knocks you down and mocks you relentlessly until you somehow stumble across the right formula only to then smash your head into another brick wall moments later. Don’t be fooled by the cute exterior, this is a game that wants you to suffer and will enjoy every moment of your pain.\n\n\n\nReview code provided by publisher.\n\n\n\nPositives\n\n\n\nNifty take on the Tetris formula\n\n\n\nNegatives\n\n\n\nNo tutorial Incredibly frustrating\n\n\n\nEditor Rating\n\n\n\nOur Score\n\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\nSCORE OUT OF TEN\n\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\nIn Short\n\n\n\nTricky Towers is not fun or enjoyable, but you might get something out of it if you’re a masochist.\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\nNewly Added\n\n\n\nCities: Skylines is now available on Nintendo Switch as a surprise release after the Nintendo Direct\n\n\n\nNew Super Smash Bros.

GJ WP!']",2016-08-02,"Tricky Towers uses physics based tower building game mechanics. Although there is some visual similarity to Tetris, the gameplay is entirely different. It features falling blocks but the goal is to stack blocks onto a tower rather than clear rows. Random blocks drop from the top of the screen and rows do not disappear, but blocks may fall off the tower. During the game, events may cause changes to the block physics, such as doubling in size, becoming slippery, or dropping at faster rates. The player takes control of one of the available wizard avatars and must, depending on the game mode, compete against other wizards in building his wizard tower to be as tall and stable as possible, and as quickly as possible. The games are short and fast paced and are easy to pick up and play. Pieces move in half-square increments.Players can use magic spells to assist themselves or to hinder opponents.  During a match, there are 17 spells which can become available to the player. Spells are divided into Light and Dark magic categories - Light magic focuses on augmenting your tower while Dark Magic revolves around interfering with your opponents, such as damaging or weakening their towers, or meddling with their engineering efforts in other devious ways.



The game has 3 distinct multiplayer game modes: Race, Survival and Puzzle. In the Race game mode, players must compete to be the first to build a tower tall enough to pass the finish line. Efficiency and construction speed are key to this game mode and it makes for a fast paced and frantic game experience. In Survival, the player must try and place a certain number of bricks on their tower without dropping too many and losing their health. They must focus on careful construction and smart application of spells to triumph. The Puzzle game mode is more slow paced compared to the other two. Players need to try and place as many bricks on their tower as possible below a certain cut-off point. This requires a more creative style of play, as the player has to try and overcome the physics and come up with various engineering solutions.



There are also a number of single-player challenges available, where the player has to try and achieve a certain set of conditions depending on the challenge to succeed. There are also single-player versions of the Survival and Puzzle game modes where players compete for a high score, and the Xbox version of the game has a single-player version of the Race game mode.",Tricky Towers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricky_Towers

simply out of their adventurous spirits . they were trained backpackers seeking commendations from fellow hobbyists . what began as a challenging journey would ultimately cost nine of them their lives . the death toll itself would already be newsworthy , but it was amplified by the mysterious circumstances that surrounded their deaths and the scene of their last freezing breaths . their tent was cut open from the inside as if they were in a hurry . they were found dead in small groups several hundred feet from one another , some of them having been stripped during or after their final moments

ural mountains to explore the area . the game remains deliberately vague regarding when its events actually take place , which is par for the course throughout the game . the narration , performed by sean bean , doesn \' t do much to clarify things . it wants to seep itself in mystery . it looks to confuse players , and it mostly succeeds , but the confusion comes at the cost of even its own

almost nothing happens in the bookended acts other than a final revealing cutscene at the end and a few minutes of walking in the introduction . it \' s an odd choice and one that could signify a

where you are , but even then it \' s very hard to find your way around . it \' s a short game , so it \' s possible you could beat it in one sitting , but if not it can also become annoying to reorient yourself when returning to the game perhaps hours or days later ."", ""when you do find notes or campsites , the game saves and marks them on your map , again further assisting you in getting

- rounded installment yet . rune factory has always been more expansive than its sister series harvest moon , building off of the social and farming focus to include battles and broader skill sets . rune factory 4 is no different , adding in new elements and polishing previous mainstays . with so much to see and do within the game , this simulation is perfectly set up to sabotage any social life you have as you get sucked into the world of selphia and all it has to offer .\', \'true to tradition , players take control of an amnesiac hero , whose gender is determined by the player for the first time in the series . our hero is travelling by airship on a mission to deliver a mysterious object to the god - dragon , lady ventiswell , in the town of selphia . unfortunately , no sooner have they announced their intention when looters show up , knocking out the protagonist and all their memories . the object falls off the airship , followed soon by our hero .\', \'usually a fall from that height would prove deadly , but luck is on our side as lady ventiswell’s head conveniently breaks the hero’s fall as they land in selphia’s palace . ventiswell , or venti , mistakes the player for the prince they’ve been expecting and trains you to rule over the town . the real prince does show up soon , but is perfectly okay with the hero taking over , preferring to focus on his own business interests in town instead .\', \'the role of town royal creates a perfect segue into the game’s mechanics . as a royal , players are responsible for the town’s well being , and can increase their royal power by accumulating prince or princess points by attracting tourists or helping out the townsfolk . these points can be used to throw festivals , expand businesses , open shops , obtain various licenses , increase different storage spaces , or even to decide who wakes you up in the morning .\', \'festivals are a fun diversion , and the citizens of selphia certainly find a reason to celebrate on a near weekly basis . these holidays are usually competitive and wonderfully varied , so they never grow old . they can range from simple farming competitions where you advocate for your chosen plant , fishing competitions , or even fun mini - games such as the turnip festival where you throw balls at falling turnips worth different points .\', \'if you manage to place in a festival ( and don’t think it’s a done deal , the townsfolk don’t take festivals lightly ) a trophy appears in your basement . if the trophy was for a mini - game festival , you’ll be allowed to play it again any time you want by inspecting it . the trophy room also contains the high and low records for each fish you catch , the option to change the difficulty level for the game , and the winning pictures , complete with character commentary , for an illustration contest neverland co . had before the game’s release .\', \'once unlocked , farming opens up a world of possibilities as different crops can be used in cooking , forging , crafting , medicine , as gifts , or as a simple means of income through shipping . each plant has an ideal growing season , takes a different amount of time to grow , and can be easy or hard on the soil . a good supply of fertilizer is needed to upkeep the soil’s richness , and monsters can be asked to help out with the farm’s daily chores , which of course means they’ll need a daily supply of food as well .\', \'the townsfolk provide their own source of distraction of course , and the game does a good job at keeping daily interactions fresh and interesting . not only are there normal conversations to have with everyone , but also optional mini - adventures to partake in . these can range from simply running around town on a comical wild goose chase , to more involved stories that take you back to previously completed dungeons as you unravel a new mystery . characters all have their own quirks and some conversations are so surprising you may find yourself laughing out loud .\', \'the dating scene in rune factory 4 has been expanded , most notably with the addition of long - term relationships before marriage . it’s a small but welcome addition , which allows you the freedom to learn more about the characters without the permanent commitment of wedlock , and there is definitely a wide selection of characters to choose from . the inevitable inclusion of rivals also serve to spice up the dating scene , as it adds a bit of challenge to winning over your chosen guy or gal .\', \'the last heavy hitter for attention is , of course , the battles . in past games this is where the series really shines , and rune factory 4 is no different . the main story requires players to traverse through dungeons and complete boss battles if they hope to find out what happens next in selphia’s saga , but there are plenty of other reasons to charge into the dangers of battle , such as completing townsfolk’s requests , finding items , and leveling up different magic and weapon skillsets .\', \'the game does a good job at increasing battle difficulty as you progress , and even posts warning signs suggesting what level your character should be at before entering certain areas . if grinding is your thing , enemies and items do randomly respawn after you leave an area , so you can literally run back and forth between sections , including boss battles if you’re looking for really big points .\', \'it is important to consider befriending monsters , which can be done by carefully offering gifts as they try to attack you . townsfolk can also join your party ( up to two monsters and / or people at a time ) if they aren’t busy and if they like you enough . each monster and person has their own specialties and weaknesses which can be important to take into consideration , but sometimes it’s just funny to pick someone like the sweet nurse or lazy blacksmith and force them into battle .\', \'dungeon crawling can be frustrating , especially when you don’t know where the next save point is . if you die , you get sent back to the clinic , and usually have to pay a steep price for your medical attention unless nurse nancy wakes you up instead of the doctor . some dungeon rooms even contain magical blockades that prevent you from proceeding until every monster is destroyed , made all the harder when portals are present that keep sending out new enemies until you break it . this is an understandably smart mechanic , as it prevents you from running past the more difficult enemies in favor of just finding the boss . however , if you do get stuck , there is an escape spell conveniently located at all times on the left hand side of the touchscreen that can be used for a small amount of rp .\', \'there are other elements to focus on , like fishing or bartering , and the game offers nearly infinite ways to feel the rush of achievement . besides farming , battling , and socializing , players can open up their own shop , learn recipes for cooking or other crafts , and can even raise a skill level just by walking or sleeping . obviously some skills actually require a lot of effort to raise them , but it nonetheless feels good to see “skill level up ! ” flash onto the screen with congratulatory music as you play . this constant reward system successfully creates an addiction to the game as you’re always achieving something and improving your character’s stats . even something as simple as opening a treasure chest , which you might think is a reward in itself , contributes to your “searching” skill which improves your max rp and intelligence level when raised .\', \'the game makes it very easy to view and learn about all these skills . in fact , it’s easy to learn about almost everything you want right from the touchscreen’s menus . the ui is intuitive and easy to navigate , showing the time , date , weather , money , and map on the touchscreen at all times . the map shows what rooms you’ve explored in dungeons , or if you’re in town , it shows the location of every citizen and visitor . there are also buttons for the escape spell , your backpack , and notebook . your notebook shows active requests , but can also show the calendar or your shipping log when you hold down l or r while clicking it .\', \'opening your backpack is like falling through the rabbit hole into a wonderland of information . items you are carrying are shown on the right hand side , and equipped armor , weapons , abilities , and spells are displayed on the left while the top screen shows your player’s stats . there is also a nifty tab on the side that slides out to show all available abilities and spells . the top section contains six tabs that lead to other menus : main , skills , recipes , party information , friendship levels , and general settings . each menu contains a wealth of knowledge about everything , such as bios for the townsfolk , what each skillset does for you , and stats on all your befriended monsters .\', \'if you want to quickly equip or use an item outside of the backpack menu , pressing the l button brings up a quick selection menu that appears at the bottom of the top screen . gameplay is paused during this , making it easy to grab a potion or change weapons in the heat of battle . items are also sorted into four categories , which you can view by scrolling up or down , making it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for .\', \'the graphics are really the only thing that falls short of expectations . there are moments whenever a potential love interest is introduced where the game plays a short anime video , but for the most part you are stuck with graphics reminiscent of sprites and a static picture of whomever you are talking to . the static images are nicely drawn though ( you can even hide the speech bubbles to see their whole outfit by pressing x ) , and character’s expressions and sometimes posture changes based on what they are saying . a nice touch is how the seasons affect character appearances , so expect to see townsfolk in swimsuits while on the beach in summer , and bundled up in winter . the time of day and weather also affects the town’s appearance , but since one real world second is equivalent to one in - game minute , you have to be quick if you want to catch someone in their pajamas .\', \'the normal gameplay graphics have hard , somewhat jagged edges and try to cram a lot of detail in . it’s not insanely bothersome , but does make the game hard to play in 3d . however , this seems a fair tradeoff as the lack of graphical information means the game is crazy fast . every room , store , and area seamlessly loads after an ultra - quick fade to black eliminating downtime and keeping the game going . this is very important for a game like this , as you run from place to place constantly and any lag would become annoying almost immediately .\', \'rune factory 4’s soundtrack is enjoyable for the most part . each season offers a different score for the town , and each dungeon also changes it up . festivals , weather , stores , and time of day bring with it their own mood music as well . these tunes provide a nice variety to the game , but can also become tiresome when you hear the same town song for 30 in - game days . it’s really a built - in pitfall for any simulation game , and one can hardly expect developers to create a new melody for every day of the year . sound effects are done well , even taking into account details like what shoes your character has equipped when you run .\', \'the rune factory series has proven time and time again that it has grown from merely being a harvest moon spinoff into a force of its own . this latest installment is easily the best of the series so far , smoothing out any problems in the previous titles , and adding in just the right amount of content to create a fuller experience . rune factory 4 provides an infinite amount of gameplay that doesn’t end once the main story does .\', ""thank you for the review . i \' m glad that you think this is a fun game , and i hope that i will too , once i buy it ."",

""\', ""rune factory 4 is set in selphia , a beautiful land populated by warm - hearted people and protected by the semi - divine ventuswill , native dragon of wind . when the protagonist falls from an airship and loses her memory , she is assumed to be a princess who was scheduled to arrive in selphia that very day , and even though this is almost immediately proven false , ventuswill urges her to live in selphia castle and guide the citizens to prosperity . having no recollection of herself or her original objectives , the young woman agrees and quickly discovers her powers as an earthmate , enabling her to commune with nature on a level that normal people cannot . her amnesia , however , obfuscates a mystery that soon comes to light involving the decay of the land and its four guardians that have kept it in stasis for hundreds of years . while this tale has some surprising moments of gravity , it is juxtaposed with the day - to - day silliness typical of the rune factory series , keeping the game \' s atmosphere light and cheery . it \' s also the longest story to date for the series , with three narrative arcs , each with its own definite ending and credit roll . i can \' t say i was ever surprised by or enthralled with the narrative , but it has a certain charm thanks to its quirky characters and flavorful writing ."", ""the player will spend an average day in selphia tending to crops , raising monsters , chatting with townspeople , and exploring dungeons . most of these activities may sound mundane , but there \' s something addictive about cultivating a vegetable empire and building relationships with earnest townsfolk . every action in the game , from tilling fields and watering crops to sleeping and bathing , has a skill level that increases with repetition , so there is virtually no way to waste time , because the player is always growing in some way . the game does an excellent job of interlocking content , and gives the player many options for making progress . after growing a crop of vegetables , for instance , the player can cook them into extravagant dishes , and either sell them , give them away as gifts to a potential love interest , or reserve them for healing while exploring dungeons . this relaxing , at - your - own - pace style of gameplay lets the player pursue almost any objective in a non - linear order , although a few features and characters are tied to progression in the story . these limitations are mild , however , making the game easy to get lost in for hours while accomplishing a string of errands ."", \'as a prince / princess , the player can make use of a new "" order "" system to enact a variety of beneficial edicts , which range from holding festivals to obtaining licenses , the latter permitting the construction and operation of crafting tools within the player \\\' s home . customizing the castle with hand - made furniture is as satisfying as one might imagine , although objects are rendered in a strange , sloppy way that makes them difficult to properly arrange . in addition to ruling the town with an earthy fist , the player can undertake daily requests on the citizens \\\' behalf . these function as optional quests and do a good job of guiding the player through the game \\\' s features without feeling overbearing . finally , relationships are an important element ; chatting with neighbors and giving them gifts suited to their tastes allows the player to invite them on adventures , and some characters can even be asked on dates , which culminate in marriage and the birth of a child . this feature isn \\\' t new to rune factory , but this is the first time the player can choose between a male and female protagonist , so the number of marriageable candidates has effectively doubled . ( tsundylas or bust , by the way . )\', \'one thing that rune factory 4 excels at is not wasting the player \\\' s time . movement is speedy , text scrolls quickly , animations are fast , and travel is incredibly convenient thanks to teleportation magic and , later on , an airship . the game also makes the best of a rather complicated menu system with several button shortcuts and touch screen functionality for accessing item storage , spells , maps , and more . since much of the player \\\' s time is spent switching between tools and moving items around , i appreciate that this process is simplified as much as possible . combat is similarly fast - paced , and the animations aren \\\' t as stiff as they were in previous games , but a lithe warrior the earthmate is not . there are six weapon types ( spear , short sword , long sword , dual swords , hammer , fists ) , but each is limited to a short combo , with a single charge attack and , eventually , an "" ultimate "" attack at the end of the combo to add a small amount of depth . it \\\' s plain that combat is more of a side activity than the game \\\' s primary focus .\', ""the game also looks pretty good despite its emphasis on speed , with colorful backgrounds , expressive character portraits , and a solid framerate . there \' s also a pleasant anime opening , as well as brief animated cutscenes that play whenever the player meets a major character . the jump to the 3ds has easily made this the best - looking rune factory game yet . i can \' t lavish as much praise on the soundtrack , which doesn \' t have many memorable tunes outside of the opening theme and town theme . the character voices , on the other hand , are absolutely spot -

moba gameplay accessible . its characters challenge , but they’re not ultra demanding . its multi - phase battles require strategy and teamwork , but you don’t have to be a master tactician to succeed . it takes time to learn , but we’re talking weeks instead of months . the drawback is that its short , rapid - fire matches risk retreading the same ground a bit too often .\', \'there’s currently only one way to play gigantic : a 5v5 battle where teams must gather energy to power the massive monsters that sit on either side of the arena . these guardians are far more interesting than ordinary moba objectives because they’re active participants rather than stationary punching bags , and the few times they battle each other during a match are always exciting . watching one swoop in from its perch , wrestle its rival to the ground , and expose the weak point for its team to attack is really cool , and i wished they’d spend more time in action instead of holding back .\', \'every battle plays out in two phases , each one fun in its own regard . first is the main phase , a fun but familiar mode in which teams gather power and battle each other over objectives . it follows more of a counter - strike or battlefield’s conquest format , rewarding for kills as well as territories controlled , rather than a typical moba where control is king . the action can get repetitive , but that balance of objectives makes the main phase of gigantic enjoyable despite its familiarity . the constant back -

gathering . the sanctum falls arena during a clash stands out for me , as it transforms from the largest map in gigantic to the smallest in an instant . the action of clash makes me wonder why it isn’t the default game mode , as it makes the main phase seem tame by comparison .\', \'gigantic throws an extra layer of strategy into the battle through tiny beings called creatures with useful abilities that can be spawned from specific objective points . one might create a tree creature that heals nearby teammates , while another spawns a cyclops who builds walls to block paths ; those extra powers give more importance to the decision of which points a team should concentrate on holding , depending on their strategy . these spawned helpers are also damage sponges , giving you plenty of time to come to their rescue . as the battle rages you can upgrade them to a more powerful form , making them even more important in battle and widening your options . if a healer isn’t available and i’m near death i know i can retreat to my creature and heal up .\', \'only the sanctum falls map features something interesting .\', \'the arenas you fight in are bright and filled with color but otherwise aren’t exciting . the ghost reef is a canyon dotted with abandoned technology , while siren’s stand is an icy tundra sporting a few shipwrecks – you’d think those unique features would create a distinctive feel to gameplay , but they don’t actually do anything except serve as background decor and have no memorable interactivity . only sanctum falls features something interesting , with underwater areas that slow you down and inflict damage while you’re underwater , but even they are easily avoided and sometimes completely ignored .\', \'likewise , the roster of 19 heroes ( of which a rotating selection are available to play for free , in the league of legends model ) checks all of the traditional moba boxes in a fairly generic way . there’s a tank in the margrave , melee specialists like the bull lord knossos , the fast but weak assassin in tripp , and long - range spell casters like the mage mozu . some designs are cool , with the potion - happy uncle sven and the dragon sorcerer charnok being personal favorites , but otherwise very few of these warriors stand out on the selection page .\', \'the heroes do become more interesting in battle , though , thanks to a leveling system that’s more in -

206’s bullet barrage , for example , offers either a higher rate of fire or armor - piercing rounds at tier 1 . at tier 2 , choices depend on what you chose first : if you picked high rate of fire , you can upgrade it with either more close - range damage or the ability to slow enemies with each hit .\', \'that’s a level of customization not seen in similar games ( those without gear shops , at least ) , and experimentation is rewarding and reveals new roles for each of the 19 characters . uncle sven starts out as a standard healer , but by enhancing his fire flask with increased direct - hit damage and the ability to cause burning damage over time you can make him an effective mid - range attacker as well . being able to choose perks on the fly also allows you to adapt to the flow of each individual match , giving you an awesome power over your characters .\', \'accessing the clunky upgrade menu renders your character defenseless .\', \'the problem with this perk system is the actual process of selecting each one . accessing the clunky upgrade menu renders your character defenseless , so you can’t safely choose a new perk unless you’re waiting to respawn or you’ve retreated from action to find a quiet spot and sacrificed your momentum . the menu itself is irritating because it doesn’t always respond to button presses , which can make getting to my intended perk ( and thus the period of vulnerability ) take even longer . i fell victim to more than a few ambushes because of that , which isn’t great even if the upgrade system is impressive .\', \'all of that nuance sounds intimidating , but gigantic does a great job of teaching the ins and outs . the mandatory tutorial clearly and effectively lays the rules out , more so than others in my experience . once that’s out of the way , the practice arena lets you tinker with each character to your heart’s content , or you can play as many bot matches as you wish before jumping into the real deal . where other mobas are sometimes more keen to throw new players to the wolves , gigantic makes a real effort to provide ample opportunity to learn it , making me feel more engaged in the process .\', \'gigantic is a free - to - play game , so naturally in - game currency is a thing and can be purchased . however , the fortune card challenge system makes earning money for unlocking new characters and skins more fun than the standard grind . each card you get comes with a challenge to complete , ranging from easy ones like inflicting x amount of damage on a guardian to tougher character - specific challenges and straightforward ones like hitting a certain level with your account . having those achievement - like objectives tied to in - game cash rewards makes earning more feel like less of a chore .\', \'balancing the objective - based main phase with the rushed and frantic giant monster - powered rampage phase gives gigantic a fast and distinctive pace that separates it from the moba crowd . having to choose perks so frequently using the clumsy menu causes a lot of dumb deaths , but there are enough good ideas within each battle to keep it interesting – hopefully until more modes come along to prevent the one currently available from becoming stale . gigantic is off to a good start , but it’ll need a little variety in the future if it wants me to stick around .\', ""gigantic \' s multi -

jrpg elements in a stunning fantasy setting .\', ""rune factory began as a spin - off of the harvest moon franchise but has since taken off . at its core , it \' s still very much a harvest moon game and shares many similarities to that long - running franchise . the big difference is rune factory has combat . between bouts of farming cabbage and milking cows , you \' re sent out to defeat monsters . rune factory is a family - friendly game , so every sword swipe sends the monsters home , rather than slaying them , and treasure chests can be full of boiled eggs and plant seeds or gold and ancient swords . trying to mix the two play styles has led to some quirky titles . rune factory 4 is probably the least original of the lot , but it is also the most polished and accessible to date , and that counts for a lot ."", \'in rf4 , players take control of either lest ( a boy ) or frey ( a girl ) , a young person on the way to the city of selphia . their airship is ambushed by bandits who knock the protagonist on the head and send them off the side of the vessel . fortunately , this occurs above the home of ventuswill , the dragon who guards selphia . the hero wakes up with amnesia and this causes ventuswill and the townspeople to assume that he or she must be the royal heir who was supposed to take over the town . as the ruler of the town , you must do odd jobs and farm in addition to issuing royal decrees and living in a castle . even when the actual prince shows up , he cedes the job to your hero since you \\\' ve been doing such a great job . there \\\' s a deeper plot involving the dragons , the gradual decline of magical "" runeys , "" and your character \\\' s true identity , but it is mostly done in a lighthearted way . it \\\' s a fun story with a few dark moments , and things almost always turn out for the best .\', ""selphia is a thriving city , and there is a ton to do . you begin with a small farm behind the castle , and you can use it to begin a healthy and profitable farming business . as the game advances , you can get additional farms or expand the size of your original farm , get animal - like monsters to give you eggs , milk and honey , or use those animals as farm workers to automate some processes . it \' s very similar to rune factory 3 , but it \' s more polished . soil quality and fertilizer are a major part of the game , but they \' re more for die - hard fans than casual players . everyday players can farm to their heart \' s content without worrying about soil quality . serious players will rotate crops to avoid damaging the soil or treat their crops with expensive fertilizer and growth potions to get the highest possible yield . it \' s nice that both sets of players can play the same game without any issues ."", ""you can also craft by obtaining a forge , a kitchen set , a crafting table , and a chemistry lab , which allow you to create items . more complex items require you to level up skills by creating weaker items first ; otherwise , they take an exorbitant amount of rune points ( stamina ) to make . once you \' ve made items , you can start improving them . using higher - quality material gives you a higher - quality base item , which has a higher resale value . you can also use materials to upgrade items with new attributes , higher stats , or other cool features . you can spend hours crafting the perfect set of equipment for your character , or you can turn it into a profitable business . much of my early game money came from buying cheap wool supplies from a shopkeep and converting it into far more profitable yarn ."", \'as always , the townspeople are a big part of the game . you can befriend almost everyone , and that unlocks abilities and side - quests . you can even have your character date and eventually marry one of the townsfolk in true harvest moon style . the translation is solid and imbues ( almost ) every character with a likeable personality . my favorite character was arthur , the amusingly nerdy prince who would rather spend his days working on the local harvest report than attending to his royal duties .\', ""the biggest new feature in rf4 involves royal duties . for just about every little thing you do , you unlock prince / princess points . if you do big things for townspeople , you \' ll get a bunch . if you take down monsters , you \' ll get a few for each defeated monster . these points are a measure of how much the townspeople will tolerate you declaring things on a whim . the more points you have , the more things you can do . you can get licenses to cook , forge , run a shop or drive an airship . you can order shops to sell certain items , that a festival be held , or that your backpack be upgraded . the more significant the order , the more pp it costs . it \' s a good system to encourage you to vary your mechanics because keeping everyone happy involves not focusing on one thing . you can still do that if you want , but it \' ll take longer to build up pp ."", ""part of what makes rune factory fun is that you \' re not pigeonholed into doing one thing . you can spend a month running your personal shop or make a giant , sprawling farm and carefully balance the fertilizer levels and nutrients to get the best possible crops . you can become a blacksmith and make your money forging weapons and armor . you could adventure all the time and not worry about making stuff . you \' ll progress faster if you mix things up , but i never felt like i was being held back when i let medicine crafting fall by the wayside . it also wasn \' t difficult to get back into it once i picked it up again ."", ""rf4 has a lot of adventures . the game is packed with dungeons , both plot - related and optional . they \' re not overly complex but tend to have enough depth that it might take multiple days to complete one , especially later in the game . combat uses a simple isometric style similar to the old - school zelda games , and it largely involves swinging your weapon at enemies until they fall down . you can use anything from short - range daggers to massive broadswords and axes , each with varying speed and power . as you use weapons , you unlock the ability to charge them up for extra damage or unleash an ultimate attack that drains some of your rp but hits hard . you also unlock special rune skills that can be anything from fireballs to powerful swings of your sword but require a chunk of rp . combat is fun , especially when you \' re trying to clear large rooms of enemies without getting hit , but it falls into some rote patterns after a while . there \' s only so much variety available with the combat system , and you \' ll probably fall back on the same few powers ."", ""you can also invite your townsfolk friends to adventure in the dungeons with you , but you \' ll need to equip them , and that can be costly . on the other hand , you can also bring along any monsters you \' ve tamed to work on your farm . these monsters are weaker in the long run but can survive well on their own . it \' s also hilarious to see a pair of chickens brutalizing their way through a goblin encampment . you even can gain special buff songs that power up your allies or convince them to attack certain enemies , if you \' d prefer to not do the fighting ."", ""the fun thing about rune factory is how these two elements combine . all the crafting , farming , making friends — pretty much everything you do in the game — contribute to your combat strength . there are stat levels for everything from swordplay to bathing to sleeping . the more you do , the higher your stats are . if you spend a lot of time crafting , befriending people , and growing crops , you \' ll get stronger as surely as if you punched enemies to grind levels . on the other hand , going into dungeons and fighting enemies allows you to do more in the social and crafting aspects . you unlock new characters for the town , new materials to use in crafting , and plot sequences that offer new opportunities or new places to farm . you \' re never stuck doing one thing for too long ."", \'rf4 isn \\\' t the best - looking title on the 3ds , unfortunately . the graphics are fine , but they \\\' re not a huge improvement over the original ds titles and can be a little muddy in spots . the character artwork retains the modern harvest moon style of "" everyone looks roughly 12 years old , "" which leads to some adorable art design but feels weird when marriage and romance come into play . the 3 - d effect in this game is among the worst i \\\' ve seen on the 3ds . it \\\' s muddy and doesn \\\' t add any sense of depth . i strongly advise playing without the 3 - d because it only detracts from the experience . the soundtrack is good but not very memorable .\', ""rune factory 4 is probably the most polished and well - crafted rune factory to date . it doesn \' t change the gameplay much , and that \' s sometimes to its detriment , but that also makes it a very accessible and enjoyable title . it \' s fun to play , regardless of whether you \' re crafting swords , running a high - yield farm , or battling monsters in a dungeon . there \' s always something to do , and it \' s always fun to do it . it has flaws , but none really take away from the overall experience , and there really isn \' t another game on the 3ds quite like it . if you \' re looking for an rpg where saving the world comes second to growing turnips , rune factory 4 is the game for you ."", ""\' 8 to glory : the official game of the pbr \' ( all ) gets . . .""]', '[""you \' ve come this far . . ."", \'rune factory 4 is irresistibly charming . it has a plethora of things to do and a variety of ways to do them , and features some lovely graphics and catchy tunes . those charms are slightly tarnished by the paper - thin plot , uneven pacing , and an under - utilized monarchy system , but even with a few smudges on its noble crown , rune factory 4 rules .\', \'the story is fairly straightforward . as a hero ( or heroine ) you literally drop into the small town of selphia after a scuffle on an airship leaves with you with amnesia , where you’re mistaken for royalty and asked to rule the town and help turn it into a popular tourist destination . without any real reason to say no , your hero proceeds to spend their time doing some serious multitasking .\', ""multitasking is definitely the key word here , because there \' s a lot to do in rune factory 4 . activities include fishing , farming , cooking , crafting , exploring dungeons , running a store , fighting and taming monsters , ( deep breath ) issuing orders , running errands , participating in festivals , and wooing one of selphia \' s eligible bachelors or bachelorettes . keep in mind that almost all of these things cost you rune energy ( the rune factory equivalent of magic points ) , so you \' ll not only have to manage your time carefully , you’ll also have to ensure you don \' t overexert yourself . a little exhaustion is well worth it though , as doing multiple tasks in the space of a single day is incredibly rewarding ."", \'the rune factory series is a spin - off of harvest moon , so it’s no surprise that one of the most enjoyable tasks in rune factory 4 is farming . besides tilling the land , planting seeds , watering crops and harvesting them at the right time , you can also inspect the quality of the soil and use items to protect your fields from damaging storms . once you’ve reaped what you’ve sown , you can then sell your bounty for money , or turn veggies into tasty dishes that can be consumed for energy or given to one of the townspeople to improve your friendship with them . it’s an involved process that can get repetitive at times , but it ultimately proves rewarding when the cash and compliments from npcs start rolling in .\', \'combat is also rewarding , with fast - paced action and easy - to - understand mechanics that allow you to equip weapons , spells and abilities by simply mapping them to one of four assigned slots ( the x , y , ry and rx buttons ) . you can also swap them out at any time by opening up the in - game menu with a quick press of the left shoulder button . this is an especially handy feature when you need to change your strategy on the fly , which happens a lot since rune factory 4 features some pretty tough enemies . but don’t worry , you won’t always have to fight them . like previous rune factory games , almost all the monsters you encounter are tamable . all you have to do is figure out the right food or items to give them ( which requires a bit of trial and error ) . once you’ve made a new friend , you can order them to follow you into battle or send them home , where they’ll help out with the farmwork . some even produce useful items that you can craft things from , so it’s worth making a few furry friends .\', \'farming and fighting are great , but the best part of rune factory 4 is its surprisingly in - depth romances . there are six eligible bachelors or bachelorettes in town for you to choose from , each with their own likes , dislikes and background story . all have wonderfully quirky personalities ( thanks to xseed’s excellent localization and some fantastic voice acting ) , which makes pursuing residents an addictive past - time . after you’ve captured a person’s heart , you can go on dates and attend festivals together , and even marry and start a family . it’s fantastic fun .\', ""what isn \' t very fun is the responsibility of being royalty , which is all busywork and no pageantry or amusing abuses of power . you \' d think issuing orders from on high would be a blast , but rune factory 4 refuses to let you use your accumulated prince / princess points ( awarded for doing various tasks ) for anything other than expanding the town to attract tourists or improving your personal property , making the whole sovereign thing a bit of a bore . it’s true that you can at least assign farm work to your pets , but most of the time you \' ll be running around doing errands like a commoner instead of enjoying your royal prerogative to delegate these menial tasks to the lowly peasants beneath you . this makes the monarchy system feel like a wasted opportunity , which is a shame because given a little more imagination , it could have been something special ."", ""some rune factory fans might not mind being a powerless figurehead , but they may be frustrated by some initial foot - dragging . the obligatory 10 - hour tutorial is a real chore to get through , only somewhat helped by a request box full of tasks that pass the time until something interesting happens . and you \' ll be waiting a long time for something interesting to happen , since the story doesn \' t really get going until the second half of the campaign , and even then it falls a little flat ."", \'luckily there’s so much to do that the sluggish pacing and gauzy story can be forgiven . as previously mentioned , the fun doesn’t stop and at just farming and fighting . you can walk to the nearest body of water and fish for food , make clothes , armor and weapons that will raise your stats in battle , and participate in goofy festivals like sheering a giant sheep or catching squid . you can even plant your very own dungeon and explore it ( which yields rare items ) .\', ""with dozens of hours of gameplay ( and the option of playing well after the story ends ) rune factory 4 is definitely a good time . just be prepared to pack your patience and reign in your expectations of what wearing a crown means . you \' ll still be toiling in the fields like everybody else , but at least you can do so with a smile on your face ."", \'rune factory 4 is a great game that’s jam - packed with fun things to do .\', \'we encourage you to read our updated privacy policy and cookie policy .\']', '[\'in a genre as crowded as the moba , games live or die in the details . because of their extended learning curves , these minor difference matter more than in most other kinds of games . though gigantic ticks off many of the boxes that players might want from a moba , it also removes many of the nuances to make itself more accessible . as a result , it’s a middle - of - the - road experience that doesn’t provide the crushing lows and triumphant highs that can make mobas so rewarding .\', \'rather than make a series of drawn - out pushes toward an objective , teams in gigantic fight over multiple rounds for a resource called power . teams earn power by killing enemies , summoning creatures ( which also provide healing , radar , or defensive walls ) , or harvesting it from predetermined points around the map . the first team to gather 100 power gets the chance to attack the enemy guardian , the main objective . this structure removes the early “laning” phase of the moba ( when players on both sides sit in the same area soaking up experience just by being near creeps ) , and makes gigantic an easily accessible game . i like that you have an immediate incentive to group up , summon creatures , and pick off enemies . health and stamina regenerate quickly outside of battle , which means you’re constantly in the thick of combat , and i appreciated the change of pace .\', \'unfortunately , the moba and third - person - shooter elements interfere with each other , leading to long engagements that lack weight . mobas make their characters beefy enough to survive a few special attacks and have a chance to escape , while third - person shooter characters can usually only take a few hits before dying . gigantic sits somewhere in between these two extremes , which results in opponents attacking and using their special abilities on each other for extended periods of time . this makes each attack and character ability lack impact , so the initial rush of entering a fight fades long before the encounter ends .\', \'this slow pace extends to matches as a whole , which often feel like wars of attrition . because guardians have three health bars to chip away at , even lopsided games take longer than they should . additionally , collected power becomes a shield for a guardian when it’s vulnerable to attack , so a team can win a round and have little guardian damage to show for it . this makes longer matches feel like a chore , and the same combat loops aren’t entertaining over that extended timeframe .\', \'all of the 19 characters have their own attacks , special powers , and a focus ability that builds up over a longer period of time . a few characters have creative ideas tied to them ( aisling can summon the spirit of her father to fight for her as a separate character in battle ) , but most tend to have the standard moba skillset , with different characters specializing in damage , movement , or utility . many abilities that disable or lock the enemy in place don’t last long , making them weak and ineffective for setting up combos . unless you become attached to a particular character’s look ( and the vibrant art style definitely helps ) , you won’t find characters that beg you to invest in them .\', \'a bigger issue is that characters don’t seem to interact with each other in interesting ways ; though some have toolsets that work in tandem with themselves , i never discovered ways to work with my teammates beyond being in the same place at the same time . one of the best parts of mobas or other character - based multiplayer games is coming up with powerful combos or tricks that require coordination to pull off . i never found that here . team fights don’t have much variety beyond everyone throwing out their most powerful skills , holding down the attack button , and hoping for the best .\', \'gigantic is an accessible moba that admirably scales the genre down , but loses the magic that makes the genre so enticing . it lacks many of the myriad ability and character interactions that make learning these kinds of games so much fun , and the combat doesn’t find a comfortable center between moba and third - person action . the round - based structure may facilitate some back - and - forth matches , mostly makes matches longer than they need to be . while it might be an easy introduction to a complicated market , gigantic doesn’t have the staying power to be more than a stepping stone to better , deeper offerings .\', ""suriel plays a lot of dota and fighting games and likes to watch other

issues with the first part have been addressed ? although this dlc add - on is still far from perfect .\', \'mech land assault opens up with rico stumbling across a cargo plane being loaded with prisoners ( as evidenced by their orange jumpsuits ) , and gets word from his old buddy , tom sheldon , that international mercenary group the black hand have been rounding up prisoners like this for weeks . knowing the black hand can ? t be up to anything good , rico stows away aboard the plane and uses it to sneak through the protected airspace of an island just to the north of medici . here , rico will uncover a black hand plot that involves an abandoned eden research station ( bringing back unsavory elements from the last dlc ) , as he tries to free the black hand ? s captives and get to the bottom of the illegal operation .\', \'as usual , the story is really just an excuse for you to blow more stuff up in the open world avalanche studios has created . the true main draw for this dlc is that , as part of black hand ? s operation on this new island , they ? ve retrofitted advanced gravity - wielding construction equipment with auto - cannons , and are using them as makeshift walking tanks . early on , rico gets his hands on one of these new mechs ? and , suddenly , you have your greatest chaos - causing weapon yet .\', \'each mech can send out a powerful shockwave , as well as rip objects up from the ground ( like prison walls and trees ) , turning them into deadly projectiles . my personal favorite , though , was lifting up a goat and launching it several hundred feet off a cliff ? a great ride , at least until you get to the landing . this is the kind of mindless fun that has always been at the core of the just cause experience , and i ? m always amazed at the new goodies avalanche studios continues to come up with , not to mention how seamlessly they are integrated into the game ? s pre - existing open world .\', \'another plus with mech land assault is that , while the gravity gun may seem all - powerful , it is actually very well balanced with the world around you ? especially when facing off against other gravity tanks . unlike sky fortress ? s jetpack , which made you almost god - like in that dlc ( and actually still comes in handy at several points here ) , your mech is still susceptible to the ever - present danger posed by the black hand and their occupying force . the new island rico finds himself on may be full of plenty of things to wreck with your new toy , but this vulnerability provides a challenge that only makes the experience more enjoyable overall .\', \'where mech land assault begins to stumble is reminiscent of where sky fortress also ran into problems : a clear lack of content being offered . while you do get the benefit of being able to take your mech tank back into the main portion of just cause 3 , one new vehicle and a small additional island are meager offerings in a for - pay dlc pack . all told , mech land assault does add a dozen or so new outposts to be liberated , but with only two story missions and two gear challenges , you can one - hundred percent this add - on in two and a half hours maximum . there ? s also then the fact that the few cut scenes presented for the story missions are , once again , just art stills accompanied by voiceover .\', \'just cause 3 : mech land assault is a fun little add - on for avalanche studios ? latest sandbox adventure , but considering the overall lack of content and its relatively steep price point , you might need to be really desperate to get back into just cause 3 if you ? re using this as your excuse . still , what is here is enjoyable , and much better balanced than what we saw in sky fortress , showing avalanche studios is at least

bar was set with sky fortress ? the first piece of just cause 3 ? s three - part expansion pass ? i admit i wasn ? t expecting much from part two , mech land assault . a lot can change over three months , however , and it seems that at least some of my issues with the first part have been addressed ? although this dlc add - on is still far from perfect .\', \'mech land assault opens up with rico stumbling across a cargo plane being loaded with prisoners ( as evidenced by their orange jumpsuits ) , and gets word from his old buddy , tom sheldon , that international mercenary group the black hand have been rounding up prisoners like this for weeks . knowing the black hand can ? t be up to anything good , rico stows away aboard the plane and uses it to sneak through the protected airspace of an island just to the north of medici . here , rico will uncover a black hand plot that involves an abandoned eden research station ( bringing back unsavory elements from the last dlc ) , as he tries to free the black hand ? s captives and get to the bottom of the illegal operation .\', \'as usual , the story is really just an excuse for you to blow more stuff up in the open world avalanche studios has created . the true main draw for this dlc is that , as part of black hand ? s operation on this new island , they ? ve retrofitted advanced gravity - wielding construction equipment with auto - cannons , and are using them as makeshift walking tanks . early on , rico gets his hands on one of these new mechs ? and , suddenly , you have your greatest chaos - causing weapon yet .\', \'each mech can send out a powerful shockwave , as well as rip objects up from the ground ( like prison walls and trees ) , turning them into deadly projectiles . my personal favorite , though , was lifting up a goat and launching it several hundred feet off a cliff ? a great ride , at least until you get to the landing . this is the kind of mindless fun that has always been at the core of the just cause experience , and i ? m always amazed at the new goodies avalanche studios continues to come up with , not to mention how seamlessly they are integrated into the game ? s pre - existing open world .\', \'another plus with mech land assault is that , while the gravity gun may seem all - powerful , it is actually very well balanced with the world around you ? especially when facing off against other gravity tanks . unlike sky fortress ? s jetpack , which made you almost god - like in that dlc ( and actually still comes in handy at several points here ) , your mech is still susceptible to the ever - present danger posed by the black hand and their occupying force . the new island rico finds himself on may be full of plenty of things to wreck with your new toy , but this vulnerability provides a challenge that only makes the experience more enjoyable overall .\', \'where mech land assault begins to stumble is reminiscent of where sky fortress also ran into problems : a clear lack of content being offered . while you do get the benefit of being able to take your mech tank back into the main portion of just cause 3 , one new vehicle and a small additional island are meager offerings in a for - pay dlc pack . all told , mech land assault does add a dozen or so new outposts to be liberated , but with only two story missions and two gear challenges , you can one - hundred percent this add - on in two and a half hours maximum . there ? s also then the fact that the few cut scenes presented for the story missions are , once again , just art stills accompanied by voiceover .\', \'just cause 3 : mech land assault is a fun little add - on for avalanche studios ? latest sandbox adventure , but considering the overall lack of content and its relatively steep price point , you might need to be really desperate to get back into just cause 3 if you ? re using this as your excuse . still , what is here is enjoyable , and much better balanced than what we saw in sky fortress , showing avalanche studios is at least moving in the right direction with this post - launch content ? and giving me hope for the final chapter in the three - part dlc season pass .\', \'developer : avalanche studios ? publisher : square enix ? esrb : m – mature ? release date : 06 . 10 . 16\', \'more fun and better balanced than the first dlc in just cause 3 ?

was little more than a harvest moon game with the ability to brandish a sword and kill stuff . as the franchise progressed , however , it became more complex , and seemingly got away from being just another fantasy farm simulator . now that the series is on its fourth mainstay installment , and its sixth title overall , the formula has been refined to the point that xseed’s latest chapter feels like the most polished and complete version of the game yet . though , it’s not without its fair share of setbacks .', 'while the narrative has never exactly been front and center in rune factory , 4 ‘s tale is nevertheless highlighted to a greater degree , giving players a plot with more depth and character development than seen in any of the previous games . rf4 places folks in the role of an amnesiac protagonist who arrives in the town of selphia by total happenstance . while aboard an airship , our fair hero — whose gender is determined by the player — gets into a tussle with a pair of hijackers and is ultimately tossed overboard . the fall doesn’t kill our hero , but all the same leaves them without their memory amidst a strange town with which they are unfamiliar . it’s then that they are taken under the tutelage of a dragon mistress who mistakes them for a prince or princess and introduces him to the townspeople as such . bearing this new royal title means that the hero must assume the responsibilities of a liege , which serves as the perfect segue into the game’s mechanics and all of its features . while rune factory 4 ‘s story is hardly going to win an award for being the most compelling or creative , it’s still interesting to the point of providing even more reason to pick up the game each day . if nothing else , its characters possess an admirable amount of individuality , granting folks the chance to interact with a variety of cast members ranging from played - out stereotypes to uniquely charming personalities .', 'but even with the added emphasis on storytelling , rune factory 4 is still very much so about actual gameplay . historically , that has meant farming and dungeon - delving . while those two aspects are delivered in spades and with much polish , they are flanked by a myriad of features that create an experience ripe with countless possibilities and activities . there’s just a ton of stuff to do in this latest entry . folks can take requests from selphia’s denizens in order to earn points that they can then spend on improving the town and bringing in more money . then there’s the ability to schedule and partake in festivals , some of which are exclusive to the different seasons , and of course there are plenty of npcs with which to interact and earn their trust .', 'of course , like in games of yore , building relationships is a significant part of the rune factory experience . here in 4 , we are shown a system that is both new and old . old in that building rapport with townies ultimately helps players acquire new equipment , crops and the like — and of course players can still befriend and subsequently marry the guy or gal that catches their eye . this is also where a new feature comes into play : it is now possible to establish long - term relationships with love interests prior to marriage . this system is a minor improvement , but a welcome one regardless . being able to engage in serious relationships , without the parameters of marriage , feels liberating in that it lets folks explore love interests with depth , but without feeling the need to pull the trigger on proposing to a specific person in order to get to know them on a closer level . it’s not a game - changing mechanic , but its inclusion shows that developers neverland co . were willing to add another layer to the dating scene .', 'like in the previous titles , playing the dating game is a big deal here . fortunately , there’s a great deal of ladies ( or guys ) from which to decide . there are also rivals , which makes winning a particular person’s heart all the more challenging . as always , this aspect of rune factory 4 is wonderfully realized and one of the parts that we consistently looked forward to when starting up each of our play sessions . the fundamentals of this system haven’t changed much , minus the long - term relationships facet , but it didn’t need to , as the process that’s been in place has been rock solid all along .', 'so dating and marriage is only part of rune factory 4 . the other two portions are its biggest components . firstly , the farming . while the original rf possessed a large helping of this feature , with each successive installment the farming aspects of the series have seemingly taken a bit more of a backseat . while it’s still an integral piece of the factory pie , it’s influence has waned some , no doubt . still , the farming is fun as all get out , especially for those who really enjoy harvest moon and other similar titles . so , as in the past , tilling , sewing and watering crops has to happen on a daily basis in order to grow a decent harvest to then sell and make profits . the raising and selling of crops is as fulfilling as it was in rf3 , but players should clearly understand that this is a game that only dabbles in such simulation efforts , and does not in fact focus all of its efforts on it .', 'where rune factory 4 does narrow its focus is in the direction of dungeon - crawling and monster - taming . as aforementioned , players can take on requests from the townsfolk at any point in their adventure . some of these requests will be village - or farming - based , while others include finding or hunting items within the confines of the game’s labyrinths . combat as a whole hasn’t been changed much since the last game . sure , there’s more options available , but they’re not exorbitant or outstandingly noticeable . first and foremost , players will start off possessing only four basic attacks for each weapon . as they increase their battle proficiency ( i . e . use a particular weapon often enough ) , they earn new attacks such as charge attacks , dash attacks and extended combos . it’s good to keep in mind that combat in rune factory is all real - time action , so there’s no waiting or turn - based mechanics to be found .', 'weapon specializations also exist in a number of areas , and it’s up to each person to decide if and how they want to mix and match weapon skills with different armaments . by doing this , there’s a particular amount of tactical prowess that one must understand to get the most out of each combat scenario . in other words , combat situations can be extremely fast and frenetic , particularly so when evaluating the type and number of enemies players may face . some battles are extra challenging , while many can be handled by even the most inept action - rpg’er ; but what can be agreed upon by both sides of the skill fence is the level of intensity involved with boss battles . these situations are tough , but never to a fault — in fact , they manage to strike a balance that enables players to feel rewarded and satisfied upon completion , but never at the sacrifice of becoming maddeningly difficult . the best part about boss encounters now is the ability to befriend these characters , so that players can later call on them in times of need .', 'but bosses aren’t the only monsters to tame ; many ( read : most ) wandering monsters can be tamed and as a result used by the player for a variety of tasks . tamed creatures can perform all sorts of behavior , but the most notable is that of helping with farm upkeep . it’s a system that allows folks to better spend their time on the many tasks that rune factory wants players to pay attention to . essentially , these monsters become reliable partners and are a gratifying part of hacking and slashing through a dungeon’s caverns and hallways . outside of taming the previously said bosses , this monster - handling feature hasn’t been altered in the slightest , really ; so returning players will know exactly what to expect here in 4 .', 'then there’s the crafting to speak of . each weapon ( and there are many of them , mind you ) , armor piece and accessory has its own recipe and level . stronger weapons clearly require rarer materials and a higher crafting level to produce , with each weapon coming complete with unique passive skills , as well . players can improve a certain piece of gear ten times in total with various materials , all of which can supplement the equipment in question with increased statistics and other passive abilities . this is yet another process that brings variety and depth to the rf table .', 'as an action - rpg , so much comes down to control , though . fortunately for rune factory 4 , the game controls wonderfully . while it can be cumbersome to sort through menus to equip a new item or piece of gear , when the action ramps up , being able to move about and swing a bludgeoning item to and fro feels precise . the 3dss bottom screen is fantastically setup as well , making use of a layout that is logical , uncluttered and generally effective in its purpose and aesthetic design .', 'speaking of aesthetic fidelity , rune factory may be one of the only games that , after four primary entries in its franchise , looks nigh identical to the original title . that’s somewhat an exaggeration , and yet rune factory 4 is not the best looking game on the 3ds . in actuality , it’s nothing more than average . its use of vibrant colors is excellent , giving the whole thing a whimsical feel , in addition to the its absolutely stunning fully - animated cutscenes . but regrettably , the majority of the game unfolds through the in - game engine , which looks pixelated at times , and jaggy at others . surprisingly , we played with the 3d turned all the way up for our entire play , just to take care of the aliasing issues .', 'while on the topic of presentation , rune factory 4 sports a soundtrack that fits its fanciful tone . since much of the game is light - hearted in nature , the music carries out its role with proficiency , full of bouncy tunes that make roaming around selphia a delight . it knows when to push a hard line , though , as the boss battles are made all the more heart - pounding by percussive jams that feature fast , wailing guitar licks , suitable for anyone that wants a quick adrenaline rush . but for as good as some of its songs are , 4 ‘s soundtrack is overall fairly forgettable . it’s not that the arrangements are poor , rather they feel uninspired and on occasion phoned - in .', 'what’s perhaps more positive is the game’s localization , which has been handled here by jrpg vets , xseed . the prose are well - written , clever in their approach to characters and resonate where they need to deliver something more serious . in this , the game is a pleasure to read , which is a requirement when its entirety consists of text . xseed have also done a fantastic job at making each of the characters feel unique , with certain tonal quirks permeating their personalities .', 'rune factory 4 doesn’t do enough to distinguish itself from its predecessors , but the combat depth and amount of things to do around town and on the farm will keep players busy for a long , long while . it’s still an action - rpg with sim elements and feels more like rune factory 3 . 5 than a full - fledged sequel , but the old adage of “if it ain’t broke , don’t fix it” rings true here . if you haven’t been a fan of rune factory in the past , 4 isn’t going to do much to change your mind . thankfully , the localization is top - notch and the gameplay remains as enjoyable as ever , making the game easily worth its price of admission for returning veterans and rpg enthusiasts alike . it may not be the best 3ds roleplaying experience , but it’s a darn fine one all the same . platform : 3ds', '© 2018

the vast differences in cultures or countries there is one constant that’s found in every single family : we love to torment each other ! it’s fun . my brother is a long time rune factory fan , so naturally i waved my review copy under his nose with a roaring rendition of “nana - nana - na - na” . the running i do each morning is starting to pay off .', 'for those who are uninitiated , rune factory is a clever amalgamation of two very different , but very well put together , types of games . primarily , it’s a top - down perspective action rpg with sprawling amounts of weapons , armor , accessories , maic , items and all the other bells and whistles you’d expect to see . but , there’s a clever twist in the form of a farm ! that’s absolutely right . make sure you tend to your crops before you go out orc slaying ! the farming is hugely integrated into your income , and i daresay it’s required . there are other means of obtaining precious gold , but your crops will rake in the most .', 'obviously , for a game like this to work , the farming and fighting have to go hand in hand , and in rune factory it does . growing and selling crops will earn you money for superior gear and medicine , while completing quests and crushing wildlife will earn you a reputation with the town’s folk , allowing your quaint little village of selphia to flourish . one of the more interesting mechanics in game is the “prince points” system . doing deeds for the villagers will earn you points that have various and different uses , including expanding your farm to include stables , bigger shipping boxes , or increased inventory space . you can also use the points to book festivals or upgrade shops around town to include a bolstered stock of goods . choose wisely , because you can only earn so many points per day . it’s kind of addicting too to be prepared to do more of this then you aniticipated .', 'combat is relatively simple and is easily mastered . it utilizes a hotkey system that allows you to assign spells to either “x” or “y” , in addition to using your standard attack button . this is incredibly valuable as navigating the inventory during combat is clunky , and quite frankly a bit of a chore . it appears however that this was taken into consideration by the developers , because the game automatically pauses the moment you bring up the menu screen , saving you from an unfortunate and grisly fate .', 'like any good rpg , rune factory 4 rewards you for your deeds , and quite handsomely at that . there is an immediate sense of accomplishment as each individual task you are capable of performing , such as swordplay , harvesting , cooking , using magic , and even sleeping , has its own separate progression bar , and notifies you when you’ve made an improvement . that being said , rune factory 4’s biggest downfall comes in the form of its writing , which is simple , almost insultingly so at times . the story suffers from this most of all , which begins with what could almost be considered one of the deadly sins of gaming : amnesia . right from the get go your character gets a swift bonk to the head and can’t remember who he ( or she ) is anymore . i’ve seen this in games too many times now . it’s safe , it’s easy , and it’s a copout . a zero effort blank slate if you will .', 'the art matches the game to a tee . absurdly oversized weapons and colorful characters really are the calling card of the japanese rpg , and it oozes from the game in spades . a dragon with feathers ? check . an adorable sheep - rabbit ? check ! a sword the size of your body ? check , check , check . the world itself is presented in the form of a series of colorfully painted 2d images , with everything else laid over top . it looks good…most of the time . i found that the 3d effect would pop further forward than the hud , which was jarring and very hard to look at . as a result , i spent most of my time playing with the 3d off . the atmosphere wasn’t lost on me though , as the music did a good job of filling the void . i do admit though that the voices felt very stereotypical , which in this case wasn’t a bad thing , just predictable . the sound quality was incredible though ! i’ll try not to gush , but i was impressed by what was probably some of the clearest voice acting that i have heard on the 3ds to date .', 'rune factory 4 is another solid entry in an already strongly established series , and it isn’t showing any sign of stopping . it’s got the charm and outward appeal , as well as simple but fulfilling gameplay to draw in new comers , but it’s also got the depth and versatility that keeps veterans coming back time and time again . what it lacks in the form of a gripping story , it makes up for with rewarding , fun , and simple gameplay that can be enjoyed by everyone .', 'asus orion pro gaming headset review – need a new headset ? look no further .']"", '[\'html public "" - / / w3c / / dtd html 4 . 01 transitional /

towns and take a look around . but there was no brass ring , no storyline or ultimate goal , and it ended up feeling a lot like real life ; you do a bunch of chores only to wake up and do them all

good about recommending ."", ""since having an actual story is what sold me on rune factory 4 , we \' ll start there . i didn \' t say it was a great story , but its presence is enough to keep the

given reign to act as the town \' s mayor . . . for some reason . the town is home to a large dragon that gives you advice and encouragement , as well as a number of different personalities , shops and attractions . just outside the town gates are dungeons and enemies galore , with tougher enemies and areas opening up as you follow the story . by the end of the main storyline ( between 20 - 30 hours , depending on how quickly you race through ) , the town is better for your presence and you \' ve recovered your memory - just like you \' d expect . the plot really only serves as a framework

a powerhouse . you can cook , craft , even get married and become a parent , life \' s ups and downs are all present and accounted for . all these activities have a fun , semi - addictive bent to them , and playing the game for five minutes or five hours at a time are both equally feasible choices . once your farm is up and producing new things on a daily basis , crafting , shipping goods and cooking become a brand new addiction , piling right on top of the old one . the harvest moon farming formula works and has fans around the globe , and rune factory 4 doesn \' t attempt to fix what isn \' t broken ."", ""the other half of the equation was what kept me coming back to the game . the dungeons and combat make rune factory 4 so much more than just another sim . players can equip and learn tons of different weapons and pound their way through enemy lairs in search of the next boss encounter . these segments play like so many action rpgs , with a single button attack and special moves mapped to various other buttons and button combos . leveling up is fast and easy , making repeated runs though enemy filled areas just as rewarding as learning to grow or cook a new vegetable or meal . the boss encounters liven things up , but are largely forgettable ; after finishing the main story i \' m hard pressed to remember what the first few bosses even looked like . the game \' s story drives players to new dungeon every few hours or so , and fans of both farming and fighting won \' t get worn out if they prefer on activity to another . my only real complaint with the combat is that enemies respawn constantly . if you leave a screen after finishing of its inhabitants , walking to the next screen and immediately back completely refills all the enemies you just cleared out . it \' s annoying , but it also works as a way for players to level up a little faster by exploiting the system ."", \'aside from enemy respawns , my other beef with the game is the presentation .

the galaxy . aided by your incessantly annoying , suspender - wearing sidekick jimmy , you blast and build your way through several star systems , ignoring the protests of the local populace . raising enough capital will allow you to take on the boss , at which point your rampage continues till you’ve conquered six star systems in all . unfortunately , what should be a joyous blend of combat , conquest and colonization veers off - course .', 'there’s no denying that vostok inc looks a treat ; it sports an eighties - era colour palette which , coupled with an electronic soundtrack , makes you want to go out and buy a ridiculously oversized mobile phone . and the twin - stick controls are suitably responsive , giving you ample opportunity to avert your course before you plow idiotically into an asteroid or enemy . there are a range of foes to fight , though it’s mildly disappointing that enemies in subsequent areas tend to be reskinned versions of foes from other levels . the game’s bosses , thankfully , are more varied and provide a worthy challenge , so much so that defeating them is a real achievement .', 'aside from combating the regular enemies that assault you as you roam around each system’s scrolling play area , you’ll periodically have to deal with scouts that appear on screen . dispatch them quickly and there’s no issue , but let them escape and you’ll be locked into a frenetic single - screen battle with a range of foes ; this is a particularly neat feature that serves to keep you on your toes . though , irritatingly , the game still subjects you to this even if your main craft has been destroyed and you’re roaming around in your escape pod , which has a mere ten armour points . but on the whole , vostok inc has many of the elements of an enjoyable shoot - em - up .', 'the problem is that it’s mired in mediocrity by an uninspiring building system that’s more cookie clicker than command and conquer . nongunz , which we also reviewed , had a similar feature but didn’t force it upon you . vostok inc , on the other hand , refuses to let you confront each level’s boss until you’ve gathered enough “moolah” , the game’s currency . your primary means of accumulating moolah is landing on planets and constructing buildings , which is just a matter of clicking on the building of your choice . the building will then start to generate moolah which you then use to construct bigger buildings ; these in turn give you more moolah .', 'and that’s it . there’s no real element of strategy as to which building you construct ; while each construction’s respective descriptions pointedly underline its potential for exploiting people it doesn’t matter whether you construct a school or a waste plant . you simply build the most expensive one you can afford because that will give you the highest income rate . with no customer discontent to deal with it’s simply a matter of sitting back and letting the money roll in . literally , since i found the best way to make progress was to leave the game running while i did something else .', 'perhaps this is meant to be a commentary on the sometimes dull nature of big business , but it doesn’t make for an enjoyable game . nor does the game’s humour alleviate the tedium . aside the satirical descriptions of the buildings , you’re subjected to a stream of dad jokes and quotes from jimmy who can’t be turned off , though this will apparently be addressed in a future patch .', 'vostok inc ‘s manager system offers an interesting blend of risk and reward . you can rescue floating managers who often turn out to be executives or middle managers , either of whom will boost your income rate . the former need to be kept amused through a virtual pet style system which , while appealing at first , requires you to spend so much time farming asteroids for rewards that you’ll likely end up ignoring their incessant demands . middle managers , on the other hand , don’t need rewarding , but should your ship be destroyed they’ll be lost in space . i went out of my way to collect middle managers only to lose one fifty in one fell swoop . true , it was my own fault and at least i got an achievement out of it .', 'the game does have high points , when you’re given a glimpse of what might have been if the game’s idle clicker system hadn’t been inflicted upon you . i

a lot of dungeon exploring , hack and slash monster killing to engage in , the more mundane tasks will become equally important . the request box breaks down these various activities , like farming , crafting , and cooking , and does a great job of explaining why these activities are useful .\', \'and while not an addition to the series , fans will note that relationships and the continued growth of those bonds play a pretty important role with rune factory 4 . like previous entries , you can bestow gifts and other items upon various characters in town that will build your overall affinity levels with an npc . and again like previous entries , you can marry various characters . but there’s a slow build to that proposal point that feels like a nice touch this time around , and allows you to really feel out the personality of a potential mates before jumping in . there’s also a number of npc’s you can interact with , including some that are gained after exploring dungeons and defeating bosses .\', \'combat feels pretty similar to previous entries too , and hasn’t seen much in the way of any significant change . everything is still action focused , with a number of weapon types and armor at your disposal as you explore . you’ll have a pretty open map that gradually reveals itself , with different areas cordoned off until certain story events have been hit . you’ll have the option of shortcuts via save points and airship travel , which will cut down on the need to speed through low - level areas that bear little benefit the further into rune factory 4 that you get .\', \'monsters , while providing the major source of experience for leveling up when defeated , can also again be befriended in rune factory 4 as well . you can take your friendly monsters and put them to work your farm , and even harvest material directly from them , like fur to be used in crafting . the sheer number of day to day activities you can engage in by the midway point of the story is pretty staggering , and while you’ll struggle to fill a day with things to do early on , that will become less of an issue after a handful of hours have passed .\', \'one thing that really stood out to me with rune factory 4 is how great the game looks at 60 frames per second . this isn’t what i’d label a graphical showcase , but we rarely see 60fps titles on the 3ds and it really stood out to me here . on the downside of things , the 3d effect in rune factory 4 isn’t good . most games are content to push menu items to the foreground , along with speech bubbles to show depth , but rune factory 4 manages to screw even that small effect up more often than not . it’s one of the few 3ds titles that clearly has no idea how to use the 3d function well , and you’ll be better served by having the slider turned all the way down with this one .\', \'but from a content perspective , rune factory 4 can’t be beat . it’s lightweight , upbeat story is just engaging enough to keep you moving along , and the day to day activities are addictive enough that you’ll keep coming back . the combat isn’t particularly deep , and won’t stand out as a major strength , but there are a surprising number of dungeons and zones to explore , along with bosses to fight . the biggest offence outside of the poor 3d use comes from some awful menu designs , which makes weapon and tool switching tiresome , but all in all that’s a fairly minor complaint . i definitely think rune factory 4 is worth a look , whether you’re a fan of the series or not , as it offers up a pretty unique experience on the 3ds .\',

disdain when rune factory 4 came in for review . then imagine my surprise when i find a much deeper and rewarding experience than nintendo \' s own animal crossing : new leaf that was released just a few months prior . i \' ll admit after giving up the harvest moon series nearly a decade ago , rune factory 4 might be the game that pulls me back in to the series , provided i can get past some of these ridiculously cliché characters and tropes ."", ""rune factory 4 starts with your main character aboard an airship , bound for an unknown destination , with a parcel in hand that some ne \' er do wells want to get their hands on . a short tussle doesn \' t quite go your way and now you \' re an amnesiac ( of course ) , and you \' re falling from the sky . thankfully the town of selphia and their dragon guardian ventuswill are there to break your fall . apparently you were expected , though not in this fashion , as ventuswill has you pegged for the prince ( or princess should you choose ) that was meant to arrive . how odd though that a prince / princess would be prime material for working the fields of selphia , but at least everyone seems to be helpful in the town and receptive to your new responsibilities . but there \' s something a little more sinister at play here , and by following the at times drip - fed storyline , you \' ll wind up being something a little more important than the groundskeeper of selphia ."", ""so what does being a farmer in rune factory 4 entail ? quite a lot actually . there are a number of roads you can take after the initial introduction to the game , and at times it feels like there is almost too much stuff to do in any given day . first you \' ve got to tend to the crops , and then maybe go make some food with said crops , or do you go sell them to buy seeds for more plants ? and then you \' ve got to make sure you \' re keeping up with the people in town ( who are presented in the most generically animated cut - scenes i \' ve ever seen ) and make sure you \' re giving them gifts so that they stay happy . some of these people in town feel like such cookie - cutter anime characters that it \' s almost insulting . you \' ve got the brave knight who secretly loves sweet things and is afraid of ghosts , the cheerful bath house attendant with her older sister , but the most jarring member of the town is porcoline , the town chef who is a fairly effeminate male but grossly overweight , combined with the performance of his voice actor , he stands out as the sole exception to the rest of the town \' s banality ."", ""then there are the requests from the townspeople that you \' ve got to fulfill , but not before you go searching for materials so you can build yourself a forge , or maybe a monster barn , or perhaps some cutlery for cooking ? is it someone \' s birthday ? or is there an event going on in town , like the fishing challenge or the cook - off ? there is pretty much always something happening within the town of selphia that can eat an entire day in game time ( 1 game hour to 1 minute passing in real time ) . then there \' s the actual storyline to follow , which is where the game takes a noticeable turn for the difficult ."", ""so when you decide to not be totally tied down to the farmer lifestyle , you can go out and explore the areas around selphia which is full of monsters that will have no problem mowing you down early on . the leveling up system in rune factory 4 doesn \' t adhere to the norms of \' get xp , stuff happens . \' instead it \' s similar to that of final fantasy 2 , where the more you perform an action , the stronger it gets . the same rule applies to gaining hit points , get hit , get points , and rune points which are used to perform actions like cooking , weapon skills , or magic . it pays to play so to speak , but at times it can feel a little overly \' grind - y \' making for dull patches of gameplay where you \' re just running around taking damage or plowing through enemies and fields . the biggest problem here is having little indication to tell you where you should be physically before entering certain areas . and this in turn can lead to quick deaths which also means taking a good chunk of your cash to cover the medical bills when you pass out . yes just like in real life the threat of crippling medical debt is always looming over your head in rune factory 4 , so save early and save often , which has me wondering , why is there no easy way to get back to the main menu to load my data ? you have to restart the game completely to get to a data loading screen , which is a minor annoyance ."", ""combat isn \' t much to write home about , just your typical top - down classic zelda inspired action - adventure fare , with all attacks mapped to the b button and combos that are performed by hitting the button until things die , and spells mapped to x and y respectively . there is a dash which is on the r button and is quite useful for getting out of some messy situations , and can be combined with normal attacks once a weapon has been leveled up enough . hit boxes can be a little weird against some of the bosses , causing them to hit you when it doesn \' t look like they are , and the same can be said for attacks , which don \' t always seem to have the range you think they do . it \' s not enough to be totally detrimental to the game , but it does happen from time to time ."", ""from a visual standpoint this game isn \' t looking too hot either . the 3d models are alright , but the world surrounding them looks a bit drab , with lower resolution sprites making up a majority of the locales you \' ll be visiting . the game is certainly bright and colorful , but for some reason it is visually jarring to see 3d characters running around on a 2d plane , and everything just looks flat . and the 3d effects aren \' t all that impressive either , relegated to small weather effects , it \' s almost hard to tell whether or not i have the 3d slider turned on . in terms of audio , the game is mostly forgettable in this regard , and i don \' t know if it was just me , but i was tuned out of the music to the point that i had to turn up the volume just to confirm whether or not there was music in the game . the voice acting features a lot of repeated lines , which thankfully aren \' t grating on the ears . while rune factory 4 does have a lot of stuff to do , it also falls in to that animal crossing grind where i \' d check in for a little bit , run a few errands and then put it down for a while . i felt that there was no sense of urgency to get the story done , but once things got rolling i was definitely pulled in , even if on more than one occasion i was stymied by enemies that were way more powerful

difficulties , probably due to the bankruptcy of the game’s creators , neverland , co . , had caused issues with having access to the game’s code , so it seemed that europe would yet again not receive a translated game on its shores . luckily , xseed looked for another partner to localize the game for pal countries , so that they could release it as a download only title , albeit over a year later than the initial north american release . the fun farming / rpg hybrid is here at last , and the game is once again ready to sap all your free time .\', \'rune factory 4 begins with the player , male or female , on an airship about to deliver an unknown item to somebody . it’s only a few seconds before a bunch of soldiers pop out of barrels to skyjack the ride . these dudes know the player is an amazon same day delivery man carrying a precious item , so the soldiers give you a smack on the back of the head , rendering yourself unconscious for a while and inducing a favourite illness of the genre , amnesia . not knowing who you are , you forget what you are carrying and who for , leading to the soldiers accidentally kicking you off the airship , leaving you to fall to your doom , thankfully , the fall is broken by the native dragon of wind , ventuswill , allowing you to recover , but still lacking any memories but your name . mistaken as royalty , the player takes the role of a prince or princess and must help ventuswill with running the town of selphia , cultivating a farm and adventuring the lands outside of this little thriving community .\', \'there are clearly two acts that make up the complete story of rune factory 4 , supplying a lot of content . in fact , it’s said that this instalment has the biggest story of any rune factory game . the first act is based on going into the dungeons and fighting the bosses to find out that there is something strange happening with them after they are defeated . this leads on to a journey to collect the rune spheres . act two involves a person representing the sect empire and is threatening the village , leading onto a plot that involves fighting an enemy outside of your local map . for your reward , a bonus third section opens up that acts as post game content with ridiculous hard bosses that will give you the smack down unless you have the best gear in the game . while there is this entire story to do , it’s rather thin and forgettable overall – a simple plot designed to get you moving . what makes the journey enjoyable is doing the activities themselves and interacting with the villagers , all whom stand out with their unique personalities and charming art .\', \'selphia is littered with plenty of activities to do , reminding me of the similar scale and addictive nature of animal crossing , except with the inclusion of rpg elements and friendlier villagers – people in rune factory 4 won’t guilt trip you or be angry at you for not playing after leaving the game for a few weeks . introduced early is the back garden of the castle grounds , which relates to turning a weed infested patch of land into a flourishing field of scrumptious crops . growing food becomes the main source of income , as fully developed harvests can be picked and thrown into the shipping box for cash , which means spending money on future food investments and gear to help you fight the nasties outside the village .\', \'once you have mastered the art of hoeing , planting , watering and harvesting , your selection of seeds will increase , opening options for your grown crops to be used in cooking recipes , creating medicine and crafting items , but while that is an important cycle of the game , there are other jobs to do as well . i ended up assigning a time slot to deal with my farm , normally first thing in the morning when the character wakes up at 6am . but the great thing about rune factory 4 is that you never really feel under the pressure of time , so you can casual go about your farming and adventuring freely .\', \'wandering into the wilderness means meeting a lot of enemies that need to be killed . combat is simple , and focuses on quick action , with the player able to equip a variety of weapons , such as swords , axes , staffs and fighting gloves , while armour can be worn to protect oneself . the more the player uses a specific weapon , the more skill the character gains with it . hitting certain levels will unlock additional attacks , such as being able to dash attack or charge up an attack to let go for a more powerful hit .\', \'battling is done in real - time , but lacks true depth , this is a combat system that anyone can learn , and for a game like this , it makes sense that the combat isn’t a thorn in the player’s side that stops them enjoying the game . even though each weapon category has its own set of attacks , what i found is that fighting can become monotonous from time to time , as enemies can either be hacked to death furiously by tapping one button or require a magic element to take advantage of their weakness , such as the turtles having high defence , but are feeble to fire attacks , but again this is just a player tapping one button to spam a wave of fireballs . the real challenge is the boss fights , which require timing and the ability to dodge incoming attacks to stay alive , but also keeps the combat interesting after all the fighting with the minions leading up to the boss . if you happen to be defeated , you’ll be stung with a doctor’s fee for patching you back to normal .\', \'the addition of a friendly companion means you can enter the fray with one computer buddy . this helps keep the enemies off you , and surprisingly , the ai is good at helping in battle . it made a few of the boss fights easier when my knight friend forte would gain the boss’ attention by running up and giving it a good few pokes with her sword , but this doesn’t help with the actual combat itself . it would be more interesting if the dungeon level design was better , because fast combat doesn’t have to be monotonous if it has some depth behind it . the ys series is a good example of this , a game that blends in fast action , magic , defence and solid level design to make encounters stimulate the brain , but as i mentioned earlier , this is no doubt done to keep the game simple for people who aren’t generally into action rpgs .\', \'selphia is filled with small activities to take up if you’re not feeling in the mood to nurture the farm or go on an adventure . once you have experienced the introductory quests given from the talking quest box outside the castle , you can jump into fishing to catch sea life to use for cooking ( another spare time job to do ) or selling , capture monsters to grow a ranch on the farm , using them to produce eggs , honey , milk or sell their fur , or do some forging , chemistry or crafting . the last option is doing requests that villagers have sent to the castle , acting as small quests that range from the simplest of chores , like cutting wood , to growing a special flower that is actually a dungeon . yeah , i was just as baffled when i first came across it .\', \'lastly , dating and marriage has been a thing in harvest moon for some time , but rune factory 4 is the first time this series has given players the ability to build their friendly relationships into something more . firstly , you’ll want to become friends with everyone , as this offers benefits , such as gaining new seeds and gear , but you can keep chatting with them to get to know them better , offer gifts that are tailored to their likes and then if you’ve managed to build up a good relationship with the character , ask them for marriage and become man and wife , maybe even have a kid if you agree to it . for me , my time in selphia meant that i was a dude who was taking his wife , a person who was once a friend helping me in the boss fights , on couple adventures .\', \'with all the tasks and jobs to do , there will be times where excitement will dwindle – not all the events are as good as participating in as others , and while you don’t have to max all the job roles out , some requirements , such as unlocking secret town events , require you to have met conditions that will mean taking part in these various activities to level up your skills to be able to access the higher level items that come from being a quality chef or blacksmith . this is the same for combat as well , grinding enemies that respawn on the map to level up each skill area . it’s one of the reasons why rune factory 4 makes a great bite size play for a train trip or a 30 minute session before bed , because it stops the boredom from creeping in that i sometimes felt from five plus hour sessions i would do occasionally .\', \'rune factory 4 is a game with some issues that thankfully don’t stop it from being enjoyable . the combat is on the shallow end , i would have liked more exciting dungeon designs , and it doesn’t come across as a title that is designed to pace well , but with so much to do within the game , and not being forced to progress against a time clock , rune factory 4 becomes an addictive title that has options , even if some of them aren’t exciting as others . this is a solid upgrade for fans , while offering people who enjoy something similar , maybe through the latest animal crossing game , to come to rune factory 4 with the same mindset of a pick up and play experience , but be met with rewards for all their hard work .\', ""giveaway - warface : collector \' s

north america ) , rune factory 4 is finally being released in europe , albeit limited to the 3ds eshop . for those unaware , the series is a spin - off of the popular life simulation harvest moon , splicing many of the laidback themes of farming with the adventure of fighting enemies in dungeons . the latest title is a solid addition to the series and a good starting point for newcomers alike . the life simulation / adventure series is still quite unique , but was the wait worth it ?\', ""the series is quite hard to characterise for those that have yet to experience it . the life simulation reminiscent of its harvest moon origins is definitely present , but it \' s been blended into an adventure game featuring a real - time battle system . the two concepts actually work quite well together , creating a cohesive experience that \' s arguably more realistic and immersive than either one individually . things done in the town will affect what happens when fighting monsters in dungeons , and vice versa . for example , rescuing someone from a dungeon will lead to ramifications in the interactions with other characters in the town ."", \'farming is another great example . many plants must be grown , with each type having a specific benefit . whilst many of the benefits are typically standard for an adventure game ( for example , healing characters ) , there is something charming about having to grow the plants , rather than just purchasing them . the demonstrable effects and benefits of the interactions of the two areas increase as the game progresses .\', ""the variety also means that there \' s always something to do , and players can generally choose what they want to focus on at any point . in addition to farming and fighting , players can also fall in love or use their power as a prince / princess to improve things . finding a partner in the town is a cute addition . npcs all feature different personalities , and freedom is given over whom in the town to try to charm . using monarchical power is somewhat misleading though , as often it leads to nothing more than doing odd jobs to improve the town . influence and allies in battle are won by being friendly and helpful , not wielding absolute power . there \' s nothing wrong with that of course ; the game may feature monsters to stab , but it \' s still loving and peaceful at its core . other oddball things to do include levelling up skills in things as bizarre as sleeping , bathing and walking . regardless of how pointless it sounds , it still raises a smile when the jingle plays to indicate a skill has increased ."", \'time progression plays an important role in events ( certain things will only happen on certain days ) , but the game allows players to sleep when they feel they have completed their objectives for the day . the fact that there is always a choice in when to ditch life simulation and get knee deep into some action is appreciated .\', ""the real - time battles are good fun , too , and their depth develops as the game progresses . their general short nature prevents them from ever being dull , and there \' s significant variety in the types of weapons that can be used , with each one having its own strengths and limitations . timing also plays its part , as characters can dodge attacks and wait for openings . the system feels similar to a 2d the legend of zelda adventure , except with a greater variety of viable weapons ( and spells ) . the fact that a huge amount of items can be taken on adventures is another positive , whilst even more can be stored in the town . this means all kinds of weapons can be purchased and plants acquired / purchased / grown without fear of running out of space ."", ""as with many games today , one of the first choices is whether the main character is male or female . unfortunately , the way this is presented leaves a bad taste . the player \' s character is flying in an airship and the game then makes an assumption about the preferred gender based upon how enthusiastic the response is to being so high up . to be fair , the game is quite gender neutral overall : there \' s the possibility of a female lead , and the female characters are all reasonably proportioned and wearing a socially acceptable amount of clothing . given the gender equality issues in so many videogames , most will be willing to forgive this small oversight ."", \'a source of annoyance that is less forgivable , though , is the amount of mandatory text to read . optional conversations are plentiful and usually short and enjoyable , but conversations that are required for the storyline tend to drag on to the benefit of no one . the story itself is somewhat intriguing enough to follow , which is as good as can be expected .\', \'the town features many characters , and each one is introduced with a short anime style cut - scene the first time they are met . the animations are beautiful , but they serve no purpose other than to see what the characters look like in detail . each one only lasts an average of three seconds or so , making the whole thing rather pointless .\', \'the same goes for voice acting . whilst reading through a few sentences of speech between two characters , one will occasionally say ( as in vocally as opposed to through text ) something like "" yes "" or "" right . "" it occupies a strange middle ground , providing no real benefit . players still have to read the conversation through , and there \\\' s so little vocalised that it also doesn \\\' t help to make the characters more relatable or realistic .\', ""it feels as though rune factory 4 is dipping its toes into cut - scenes and voice acting when really it should just be diving in . the results indicate that there \' s plenty of potential , but they are both used for too short a period to have any real impact . in summary , it \' s a wasted opportunity and a borderline cause of frustration . luckily there are so many positives to make up for it ."", \'financial problems for developers neverland co . may mean that rune factory 4 is the last in the series , and its release in europe at all is surprising given the circumstances . the game itself is a good addition to the series . niggles with presentation and the amount of mandatory text to read are present , but there are so many positives to take from the engaging and varied experience . the game comes recommended for anyone curious about what an action title crossed with a life simulator can deliver .\', \'there are no replies to this review yet . why not be the first ?\', \'enter the letters in the image to validate your comment .\', \'if you are a registered member and logged in , you can also subscribe to topics by email .\', ""i don \' t know about you , but i \' m feeling 22 .

( during the landing , you get knocked on your head , leading to a bout of amnesia . ah , japan ? will you ever tire of that trope ? ) the village ? s caretaker is a legendary dragon , and she’s certain that you are a prince ( or princess ) come to bring good fortune to all who live there .\', \'while you ? re rather uncertain of your newfound royalty , you decide that you might as well earn your keep by helping make the village a better place . for those familiar with the long line of harvest moon games , this means activities like growing and selling crops , tending to livestock , and socializing with your new friends and neighbors . the other side to rune factory 4 is combat and monster - slaying , something that definitely makes the game a bit more familiar and easier to understand for those who have no experience with harvest moon . initially , venturing outside of the protection of the village ? s walls will come from simple curiosity , but as the game plays out , quests and storyline progression will push you to explore new areas and vanquish menacing beasts .\', \'my opinions on rune factory 4 were a bit mixed at first , and then it dawned on me as to why : my brain had been tricked into expecting a level of pacing that it shouldn ? t have . i ? ve played enough harvest moon at this point that i ? m accustomed to ( and appreciative of ) its slower , more laid - back way of doing things , but that gets muddied the moment action is thrown in . where’s the next area i need to explore ? what’s the next big monster for me to kill ? why aren ? t i being given those things at a faster rate ?\', \'when you find the ability to get past thrusting action - adventure expectations upon it , rune factory 4 can really be entertaining . a game where your main character is tasked with both creating life and causing death seems like an idea that could easily feel disjointed , but it works . the player is given a nice amount of flexibility in what needs to be done and when , so you can always decide that you ? d rather focus your energy on interacting with others and helping build up the village , or you can put responsibility aside for a bit and just have fun adventuring in the wilderness .\', \'of course , rune factory 4 is at its best when you roll up your sleeves and balance everything the game has to offer simultaneously . as i ? ve never played any of the previous rune factory games , i didn ? t have any reference with which to determine how much better ( or potentially worse ) the elements offered up here were in comparison to previous chapters ? but as my introduction to the series , it hooked my pretty early . the npc villagers you ? ll encounter have some charming personalities to them , so long as you ? re willing to put forth the effort to get to know them better . aspects like farming , cooking , and crafting flesh out nicely as you unlock more options and abilities , and even the element i was most concerned about ? combat ? was more fun than i’d assumed it would be . this really is a farming game and an action game brought together , a combination that could easily go wrong had it been in less - capable hands .\', \'and yet , it also could be in more capable hands . as surprised as i was with rune factory 4 , and as much as i enjoyed a decent chunk of the time i spent with it , sometimes that enjoyment came in spite of the game ? s execution . both aspects of the game ? its social side and its more traditional game side ? could definitely be better , and if they were , this could be a heck of a franchise . conversing with villagers ( or eavesdropping on them while they converse with one another ) is fun , but i was left wishing that the whole social aspect had more depth to it . meanwhile , rune factory 4 ? s action elements feel like a supplement to a farming game , where i wish they were strong enough to stand on their own .\', \'rune factory 4 reminds me a lot of persona 3 and 4 , titles that also marry two very different schools of gameplay into one total package . atlus ? recent persona efforts work as well as they do because they offer halves that are strong enough to survive on their own ? even when they ? re meant to always be a couple joined in cohabitational bliss . i never felt as if rune factory 4 ? s farming or fraternizing was ever as strong as what i ? ve received from harvest moon , nor was its quite on the level of any host of action - adventures offered up on the 3ds or otherwise .\', \'that doesn ? t mean rune factory 4 is a bad game ? i want to be clear on that . it’s a good game that could be great ; i’ts a b - average student who could study harder and get many of their grades up to as . rune factory 4 only failed in my eyes in two ways , and those were its graphics and user interface . the ui is easily the biggest negative checkmark ; in a game so focused around working with a wide variety of both tools and weapons , throwing them all into a few cumbersome item containers with no real way to quick - select your most - used instruments means you ? ll be spending far more time moving through menus than you should have to . meanwhile , the game ? s visuals are too unimpressive too much of the time . backgrounds feel as if they were initially meant for a lower - resolution platform and then upscaled , and there ? s a level of stylistic inconsistency that runs through everything from characters to items to monsters .\', \'those two aspects of the game are failures ? but failures in what’s otherwise a pretty solid experience . i couldn ?

how would that ever work , i wondered . would you be getting into random battles with local wildlife ? would you cast spells to make your crops grow ?\', \'you have to understand that , back then , one couldn ? t imagine a game like harvest moon , because its ideas simply hadn ? t been tried yet . when the game was finally released in english on our shores , the experience wasn ? t quite what i’d imagined at its announcement .\', \'the funny thing is , years later , a series would be released by harvest moon parent company marvelous entertainment that actually hit close to my initial expectations of what a ? farming rpg ? would be : rune factory : a fantasy harvest moon .\', \'i ? d never found the time to really give the rune factory series a proper chance , so i came into the franchise ? s sixth chapter ? rune factory 4 for the 3ds ? with a handful of expectations but absolutely no experience .\', \'some of those expectations were met . rune factory 4 is , indeed , a game where you raise crops and kill monsters ? sometimes , strangely , at the exact same time . the game opens with your character accidentally falling out of the sky , resulting in a rather rough landing in the small village you ? ll soon call home . ( during the landing , you get knocked on your head , leading to a bout of amnesia . ah , japan ? will you ever tire of that trope ? ) the village ? s caretaker is a legendary dragon , and she’s certain that you are a prince ( or princess ) come to bring good fortune to all who live there .\', \'while you ? re rather uncertain of your newfound royalty , you decide that you might as well earn your keep by helping make the village a better place . for those familiar with the long line of harvest moon games , this means activities like growing and selling crops , tending to livestock , and socializing with your new friends and neighbors . the other side to rune factory 4 is combat and monster - slaying , something that definitely makes the game a bit more familiar and easier to understand for those who have no experience with harvest moon . initially , venturing outside of the protection of the village ? s walls will come from simple curiosity , but as the game plays out , quests and storyline progression will push you to explore new areas and vanquish menacing beasts .\', \'my opinions on rune factory 4 were a bit mixed at first , and then it dawned on me as to why : my brain had been tricked into expecting a level of pacing that it shouldn ? t have . i ? ve played enough harvest moon at this point that i ? m accustomed to ( and appreciative of ) its slower , more laid - back way of doing things , but that gets muddied the moment action is thrown in . where’s the next area i need to explore ? what’s the next big monster for me to kill ? why aren ? t i being given those things at a faster rate ?\', \'when you find the ability to get past thrusting action - adventure expectations upon it , rune factory 4 can really be entertaining . a game where your main character is tasked with both creating life and causing death seems like an idea that could easily feel disjointed , but it works . the player is given a nice amount of flexibility in what needs to be done and when , so you can always decide that you ? d rather focus your energy on interacting with others and helping build up the village , or you can put responsibility aside for a bit and just have fun adventuring in the wilderness .\', \'of course , rune factory 4 is at its best when you roll up your sleeves and balance everything the game has to offer simultaneously . as i ? ve never played any of the previous rune factory games , i didn ? t have any reference with which to determine how much better ( or potentially worse ) the elements offered up here were in comparison to previous chapters ? but as my introduction to the series , it hooked my pretty early . the npc villagers you ? ll encounter have some charming personalities to them , so long as you ? re willing to put forth the effort to get to know them better . aspects like farming , cooking , and crafting flesh out nicely as you unlock more options and abilities , and even the element i was most concerned about ? combat ? was more fun than i’d assumed it would be . this really is a farming game and an action game brought together , a combination that could easily go wrong had it been in less - capable hands .\', \'and yet , it also could be in more capable hands . as surprised as i was with rune factory 4 , and as much as i enjoyed a decent chunk of the time i spent with it , sometimes that enjoyment came in spite of the game ? s execution . both aspects of the game ? its social side and its more traditional game side ? could definitely be better , and if they were , this could be a heck of a franchise . conversing with villagers ( or eavesdropping on them while they converse with one another ) is fun , but i was left wishing that the whole social aspect had more depth to it . meanwhile , rune factory 4 ? s action elements feel like a supplement to a farming game , where i wish they were strong enough to stand on their own .\', \'rune factory 4 reminds me a lot of persona 3 and 4 , titles that also marry two very different schools of gameplay into one total package . atlus ? recent persona efforts work as well as they do because they offer halves that are strong enough to survive on their own ? even when they ? re meant to always be a couple joined in cohabitational bliss . i never felt as if rune factory 4 ? s farming or fraternizing was ever as strong as what i ? ve received from harvest moon , nor was its quite on the level of any host of action - adventures offered up on the 3ds or otherwise .\', \'that doesn ? t mean rune factory 4 is a bad game ? i want to be clear on that . it’s a good game that could be great ; i’ts a b - average student who could study harder and get many of their grades up to as . rune factory 4 only failed in my eyes in two ways , and those were its graphics and user interface . the ui is easily the biggest negative checkmark ; in a game so focused around working with a wide variety of both tools and weapons , throwing them all into a few cumbersome item containers with no real way to quick - select your most - used instruments means you ? ll be spending far more time moving through menus than you should have to . meanwhile , the game ? s visuals are too unimpressive too much of the time . backgrounds feel as if they were initially meant for a lower - resolution platform and then upscaled , and there ? s a level of stylistic inconsistency that runs through everything from characters to items to monsters .\', \'those two aspects of the game are failures ? but failures in what’s otherwise a pretty solid experience . i couldn ?

Their cause was born simply out of their adventurous spirits. They were trained backpackers seeking commendations from fellow hobbyists. What began as a challenging journey would ultimately cost nine of them their lives. The death toll itself would already be newsworthy, but it was amplified by the mysterious circumstances that surrounded their deaths and the scene of their last freezing breaths. Their tent was cut open from the inside as if they were in a hurry. They were found dead in small groups several hundred feet from one another, some of them having been stripped during or after their final moments to clothe the others, some of whom even fled barefoot. One of the deceased hikers even lost her tongue, eyes, and part of her lips.\n\n\n\nThe grotesque scene remains a mystery to this day, with their cause of death officially being credited to only an ""unknown compelling force"". Each theory — avalanche, wildlife, government tests, extraterrestrials — has its own holes that can\'t be resolved. The events of\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\nrevolve closely around this tragic true story and offer up its own dark explanation. If you believe all that sounds like a great premise, I would agree, which is why it\'s so disheartening to see that potential squandered.\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\nis told through a first-person horror adventure framework. Players take on the role of an unknown observer who arrives at the Ural Mountains to explore the area. The game remains deliberately vague regarding when its events actually take place, which is par for the course throughout the game. The narration, performed by Sean Bean, doesn\'t do much to clarify things. It wants to seep itself in mystery. It looks to confuse players, and it mostly succeeds, but the confusion comes at the cost of even its own merits as a narrative. Despite having gone into the game already fascinated with the Dyatlov Pass Incident, as it\'s today known, I was stunned to see just how little intrigue the game manages to foster, especially given that it combines my two favorite genres.\n\n\n\nThe first sign that something may be amiss with\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\ncomes very early into the game. The first scene, billed Act I, takes all of about three minutes to move through before the game is remarkably on to Act II which is where the bulk of the game takes place. It seems illogical to structure the game into three acts — the third act comes right at the end of the game too — when almost nothing happens in the bookended acts other than a final revealing cutscene at the end and a few minutes of walking in the introduction. It\'s an odd choice and one that could signify a troubled game, though it would not guarantee it. Unfortunately, the rest of the game delivers more of the same structural and narrative issues throughout its roughly three to five-hour playtime.\n\n\n\nDyatlov Pass and video games should be peanut butter and jelly...\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\nutilizes minor survival mechanics in that you are armed only with a map, compass, and flashlight. Your stamina is Alan Wake-poor and the map is particularly unforgiving, never identifying with an icon where you are. Instead, the game gives players a sequence of coordinates to visit and as you head off at the start of Act II in any direction you please, it\'s up to you to literally find your bearings. Sometimes coordinates will be seen on rocks and cliffsides which go a long way to determining exactly where you are, but even then it\'s very hard to find your way around. It\'s a short game, so it\'s possible you could beat it in one sitting, but if not it can also become annoying to reorient yourself when returning to the game perhaps hours or days later.\n\n\n\nWhen you do find notes or campsites, the game saves and marks them on your map, again further assisting you in getting a lay of the land. Unfortunately, such moments can come too far between one another, which means the game\'s dizzyingly one-note landscape and hostile (though laughable) enemies can be a huge burden on players who might die after a lot of progress that just didn\'t involve registering an autosave. Even sprinting is a pain as it doesn\'t allow for toggling. If you want to sprint you have to hold down the left stick while moving it forward, which anyone who\'s played a game before will tell you is bad design. Call it survival mechanics if you\'d like. More often losing your way and losing your progress so easily are each just aggravating.\n\n\n\n...but in this case it\'s more like onions and oranges.\n\n\n\nThe notes and narration never come around to deliver a story worthy of its setup. Other media have tried their hand at telling compelling Dyatlov Pass stories to varying levels of success, but it\'s notable to consider video games as perhaps the most native medium to telling a successful story based on the incident and yet\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\nsquanders it all away through convoluted monologues and tedious design. It alleges itself a horror game of sorts, but beyond a moody opening score\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\nis one of the farthest off-the-mark attempts at being scary.\n\n\n\nThere are fleeting moments that reveal what might have been, like when you do find your way out of the repetitive terrain and into unique areas like a cabin, a burned forest, and a collapsed building. These areas are always central to the story and try to mix up the simple mechanics just slightly, and they always make it feel like this game could\'ve been memorable if such moments weren\'t so few and far between, or if the enemies posed any real threat other than annoying instant deaths — or if the story captured the essence of its subject matter. There are a lot of \'ifs\' with\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nAchievement hunters will at least be pleased. The game isn\'t a difficult completion with a guide — and there are already many given that the game has come to Xbox much later than other platforms. Story related unlocks will get you about half of the game\'s 20 achievements, while the rest mostly go to collectibles and seeing the game\'s ""\n\n\n\nreal ending\n\n\n\n"". Like a lot of bad games with quick lists,\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\ntakes not skill but just patience for its sub-five hour completion.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nThe Dyatlov Pass Incident is one of the most fascinating real life horror stories of the last century. It\'s a topic built to be adapted to different forms of media, arguably video games more than any other. Somehow\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\nis given this head start and trips all over itself. The story fails to take off while the gameplay only serves to annoy. It\'s never scary, save for a theme song that even then is played so often that it loses its effect. Horror and walking sims are my two favorite genres in the medium, but\n\n\n\nKholat\n\n\n\nserves as another unfortunate reminder that they don\'t belong together.\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nPositives\n\n\n\nMay intrigue those familiar with the true story\n\n\n\nNegatives\n\n\n\nNot scary in the slightest\n\n\n\nStructural concerns galore\n\n\n\nFeels quite aimless\n\n\n\nSquanders a great premise\n\n\n\nEthics Statement\n\n\n\nThe reviewer spent four hours in the Ural Mountains, usually lost and never scared.

Rune Factory has always been more expansive than its sister series Harvest Moon, building off of the social and farming focus to include battles and broader skill sets. Rune Factory 4 is no different, adding in new elements and polishing previous mainstays. With so much to see and do within the game, this simulation is perfectly set up to sabotage any social life you have as you get sucked into the world of Selphia and all it has to offer.\n\n\n\nTrue to tradition, players take control of an amnesiac hero, whose gender is determined by the player for the first time in the series. Our hero is travelling by airship on a mission to deliver a mysterious object to the god-dragon, Lady Ventiswell, in the town of Selphia. Unfortunately, no sooner have they announced their intention when looters show up, knocking out the protagonist and all their memories. The object falls off the airship, followed soon by our hero.\n\n\n\nUsually a fall from that height would prove deadly, but luck is on our side as Lady Ventiswell’s head conveniently breaks the hero’s fall as they land in Selphia’s palace. Ventiswell, or Venti, mistakes the player for the prince they’ve been expecting and trains you to rule over the town. The real prince does show up soon, but is perfectly okay with the hero taking over, preferring to focus on his own business interests in town instead.\n\n\n\nThe role of town royal creates a perfect segue into the game’s mechanics. As a royal, players are responsible for the town’s well being, and can increase their royal power by accumulating prince or princess points by attracting tourists or helping out the townsfolk. These points can be used to throw festivals, expand businesses, open shops, obtain various licenses, increase different storage spaces, or even to decide who wakes you up in the morning.\n\n\n\nFestivals are a fun diversion, and the citizens of Selphia certainly find a reason to celebrate on a near weekly basis. These holidays are usually competitive and wonderfully varied, so they never grow old. They can range from simple farming competitions where you advocate for your chosen plant, fishing competitions, or even fun mini-games such as the Turnip festival where you throw balls at falling turnips worth different points.\n\n\n\nIf you manage to place in a festival (and don’t think it’s a done deal, the townsfolk don’t take festivals lightly) a trophy appears in your basement. If the trophy was for a mini-game festival, you’ll be allowed to play it again any time you want by inspecting it. The trophy room also contains the high and low records for each fish you catch, the option to change the difficulty level for the game, and the winning pictures, complete with character commentary, for an illustration contest Neverland Co. had before the game’s release.\n\n\n\nOnce unlocked, farming opens up a world of possibilities as different crops can be used in cooking, forging, crafting, medicine, as gifts, or as a simple means of income through shipping. Each plant has an ideal growing season, takes a different amount of time to grow, and can be easy or hard on the soil. A good supply of fertilizer is needed to upkeep the soil’s richness, and monsters can be asked to help out with the farm’s daily chores, which of course means they’ll need a daily supply of food as well.\n\n\n\nThe townsfolk provide their own source of distraction of course, and the game does a good job at keeping daily interactions fresh and interesting. Not only are there normal conversations to have with everyone, but also optional mini-adventures to partake in. These can range from simply running around town on a comical wild goose chase, to more involved stories that take you back to previously completed dungeons as you unravel a new mystery. Characters all have their own quirks and some conversations are so surprising you may find yourself laughing out loud.\n\n\n\nThe dating scene in Rune Factory 4 has been expanded, most notably with the addition of long-term relationships before marriage. It’s a small but welcome addition, which allows you the freedom to learn more about the characters without the permanent commitment of wedlock, and there is definitely a wide selection of characters to choose from. The inevitable inclusion of rivals also serve to spice up the dating scene, as it adds a bit of challenge to winning over your chosen guy or gal.\n\n\n\nThe last heavy hitter for attention is, of course, the battles. In past games this is where the series really shines, and Rune Factory 4 is no different. The main story requires players to traverse through dungeons and complete boss battles if they hope to find out what happens next in Selphia’s saga, but there are plenty of other reasons to charge into the dangers of battle, such as completing townsfolk’s requests, finding items, and leveling up different magic and weapon skillsets.\n\n\n\nThe game does a good job at increasing battle difficulty as you progress, and even posts warning signs suggesting what level your character should be at before entering certain areas. If grinding is your thing, enemies and items do randomly respawn after you leave an area, so you can literally run back and forth between sections, including boss battles if you’re looking for really big points.\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider befriending monsters, which can be done by carefully offering gifts as they try to attack you. Townsfolk can also join your party (up to two monsters and/or people at a time) if they aren’t busy and if they like you enough. Each monster and person has their own specialties and weaknesses which can be important to take into consideration, but sometimes it’s just funny to pick someone like the sweet nurse or lazy blacksmith and force them into battle.\n\n\n\nDungeon crawling can be frustrating, especially when you don’t know where the next save point is. If you die, you get sent back to the clinic, and usually have to pay a steep price for your medical attention unless Nurse Nancy wakes you up instead of the doctor. Some dungeon rooms even contain magical blockades that prevent you from proceeding until every monster is destroyed, made all the harder when portals are present that keep sending out new enemies until you break it. This is an understandably smart mechanic, as it prevents you from running past the more difficult enemies in favor of just finding the boss. However, if you do get stuck, there is an escape spell conveniently located at all times on the left hand side of the touchscreen that can be used for a small amount of RP.\n\n\n\nThere are other elements to focus on, like fishing or bartering, and the game offers nearly infinite ways to feel the rush of achievement. Besides farming, battling, and socializing, players can open up their own shop, learn recipes for cooking or other crafts, and can even raise a skill level just by walking or sleeping. Obviously some skills actually require a lot of effort to raise them, but it nonetheless feels good to see “skill level up!” flash onto the screen with congratulatory music as you play. This constant reward system successfully creates an addiction to the game as you’re always achieving something and improving your character’s stats. Even something as simple as opening a treasure chest, which you might think is a reward in itself, contributes to your “searching” skill which improves your max RP and intelligence level when raised.\n\n\n\nThe game makes it very easy to view and learn about all these skills. In fact, it’s easy to learn about almost everything you want right from the touchscreen’s menus. The UI is intuitive and easy to navigate, showing the time, date, weather, money, and map on the touchscreen at all times. The map shows what rooms you’ve explored in dungeons, or if you’re in town, it shows the location of every citizen and visitor. There are also buttons for the escape spell, your backpack, and notebook. Your notebook shows active requests, but can also show the calendar or your shipping log when you hold down L or R while clicking it.\n\n\n\nOpening your backpack is like falling through the rabbit hole into a wonderland of information. Items you are carrying are shown on the right hand side, and equipped armor, weapons, abilities, and spells are displayed on the left while the top screen shows your player’s stats. There is also a nifty tab on the side that slides out to show all available abilities and spells. The top section contains six tabs that lead to other menus: main, skills, recipes, party information, friendship levels, and general settings. Each menu contains a wealth of knowledge about everything, such as bios for the townsfolk, what each skillset does for you, and stats on all your befriended monsters.\n\n\n\nIf you want to quickly equip or use an item outside of the backpack menu, pressing the L button brings up a quick selection menu that appears at the bottom of the top screen. Gameplay is paused during this, making it easy to grab a potion or change weapons in the heat of battle. Items are also sorted into four categories, which you can view by scrolling up or down, making it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for.\n\n\n\nThe graphics are really the only thing that falls short of expectations. There are moments whenever a potential love interest is introduced where the game plays a short anime video, but for the most part you are stuck with graphics reminiscent of sprites and a static picture of whomever you are talking to. The static images are nicely drawn though (you can even hide the speech bubbles to see their whole outfit by pressing X), and character’s expressions and sometimes posture changes based on what they are saying. A nice touch is how the seasons affect character appearances, so expect to see townsfolk in swimsuits while on the beach in summer, and bundled up in winter. The time of day and weather also affects the town’s appearance, but since one real world second is equivalent to one in-game minute, you have to be quick if you want to catch someone in their pajamas.\n\n\n\nThe normal gameplay graphics have hard, somewhat jagged edges and try to cram a lot of detail in. It’s not insanely bothersome, but does make the game hard to play in 3D. However, this seems a fair tradeoff as the lack of graphical information means the game is crazy fast. Every room, store, and area seamlessly loads after an ultra-quick fade to black eliminating downtime and keeping the game going. This is very important for a game like this, as you run from place to place constantly and any lag would become annoying almost immediately.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4’s soundtrack is enjoyable for the most part. Each season offers a different score for the town, and each dungeon also changes it up. Festivals, weather, stores, and time of day bring with it their own mood music as well. These tunes provide a nice variety to the game, but can also become tiresome when you hear the same town song for 30 in-game days. It’s really a built-in pitfall for any simulation game, and one can hardly expect developers to create a new melody for every day of the year. Sound effects are done well, even taking into account details like what shoes your character has equipped when you run.\n\n\n\nThe Rune Factory series has proven time and time again that it has grown from merely being a Harvest Moon spinoff into a force of its own. This latest installment is easily the best of the series so far, smoothing out any problems in the previous titles, and adding in just the right amount of content to create a fuller experience. Rune Factory 4 provides an infinite amount of gameplay that doesn’t end once the main story does.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nPros\n\n\n\nAn almost endless amount of gameplay\n\n\n\nExpanded features from previous games in the series\n\n\n\nFun and comical interactions\n\n\n\nPersonalized experience\n\n\n\nVaried gameplay style\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nGraphics fall short\n\n\n\nShaky use of 3D\n\n\n\nTalkback\n\n\n\nJasonMaivia\n\n\n\nOctober 09, 2013\n\n\n\nThank you for the review.

The ""order"" system in action. Those poor Woolies won\'t ever know what hit \'em.\n\n\n\nView Full Gallery\n\n\n\n""It\'s amazing how a myriad of small design tweaks and an obviously passionate localization have elevated the game far beyond a second-rate \'Harvest Moon with swords.\'""\n\n\n\nAll farming and no fighting makes Jack a dull… no, wait. That analogy doesn\'t work, because Harvest Moon is actually a lot of fun. The original addictive farming simulation (we do not speak of Farmville, heathens) used to capture my attention with each new iteration, but recent entries have somewhat stagnated. I thought I would find satisfaction in the added action-RPG elements of the Rune Factory games, but they never quite appealed to me the way Harvest Moon did, and 2011\'s disappointing Tides of Destiny convinced me that my connection with the series was never meant to be. With some reluctance, I approached Rune Factory 4, expecting more of the same drudgery... and against all odds, I found it remarkably enjoyable. It\'s amazing how a myriad of small design tweaks and an obviously passionate localization have elevated the game far beyond a second-rate ""Harvest Moon with swords.""\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is set in Selphia, a beautiful land populated by warm-hearted people and protected by the semi-divine Ventuswill, Native Dragon of Wind. When the protagonist falls from an airship and loses her memory, she is assumed to be a princess who was scheduled to arrive in Selphia that very day, and even though this is almost immediately proven false, Ventuswill urges her to live in Selphia Castle and guide the citizens to prosperity. Having no recollection of herself or her original objectives, the young woman agrees and quickly discovers her powers as an Earthmate, enabling her to commune with nature on a level that normal people cannot. Her amnesia, however, obfuscates a mystery that soon comes to light involving the decay of the land and its four Guardians that have kept it in stasis for hundreds of years. While this tale has some surprising moments of gravity, it is juxtaposed with the day-to-day silliness typical of the Rune Factory series, keeping the game\'s atmosphere light and cheery. It\'s also the longest story to date for the series, with three narrative arcs, each with its own definite ending and credit roll. I can\'t say I was ever surprised by or enthralled with the narrative, but it has a certain charm thanks to its quirky characters and flavorful writing.\n\n\n\nThe player will spend an average day in Selphia tending to crops, raising monsters, chatting with townspeople, and exploring dungeons. Most of these activities may sound mundane, but there\'s something addictive about cultivating a vegetable empire and building relationships with earnest townsfolk. Every action in the game, from tilling fields and watering crops to sleeping and bathing, has a skill level that increases with repetition, so there is virtually no way to waste time, because the player is always growing in some way. The game does an excellent job of interlocking content, and gives the player many options for making progress. After growing a crop of vegetables, for instance, the player can cook them into extravagant dishes, and either sell them, give them away as gifts to a potential love interest, or reserve them for healing while exploring dungeons. This relaxing, at-your-own-pace style of gameplay lets the player pursue almost any objective in a non-linear order, although a few features and characters are tied to progression in the story. These limitations are mild, however, making the game easy to get lost in for hours while accomplishing a string of errands.\n\n\n\nAs a Prince/Princess, the player can make use of a new ""order"" system to enact a variety of beneficial edicts, which range from holding festivals to obtaining licenses, the latter permitting the construction and operation of crafting tools within the player\'s home. Customizing the castle with hand-made furniture is as satisfying as one might imagine, although objects are rendered in a strange, sloppy way that makes them difficult to properly arrange. In addition to ruling the town with an earthy fist, the player can undertake daily requests on the citizens\' behalf. These function as optional quests and do a good job of guiding the player through the game\'s features without feeling overbearing. Finally, relationships are an important element; chatting with neighbors and giving them gifts suited to their tastes allows the player to invite them on adventures, and some characters can even be asked on dates, which culminate in marriage and the birth of a child. This feature isn\'t new to Rune Factory, but this is the first time the player can choose between a male and female protagonist, so the number of marriageable candidates has effectively doubled. (TsunDylas or bust, by the way.)\n\n\n\nOne thing that Rune Factory 4 excels at is not wasting the player\'s time. Movement is speedy, text scrolls quickly, animations are fast, and travel is incredibly convenient thanks to teleportation magic and, later on, an airship. The game also makes the best of a rather complicated menu system with several button shortcuts and touch screen functionality for accessing item storage, spells, maps, and more. Since much of the player\'s time is spent switching between tools and moving items around, I appreciate that this process is simplified as much as possible. Combat is similarly fast-paced, and the animations aren\'t as stiff as they were in previous games, but a lithe warrior the Earthmate is not. There are six weapon types (spear, short sword, long sword, dual swords, hammer, fists), but each is limited to a short combo, with a single charge attack and, eventually, an ""ultimate"" attack at the end of the combo to add a small amount of depth. It\'s plain that combat is more of a side activity than the game\'s primary focus.\n\n\n\nThe game also looks pretty good despite its emphasis on speed, with colorful backgrounds, expressive character portraits, and a solid framerate. There\'s also a pleasant anime opening, as well as brief animated cutscenes that play whenever the player meets a major character. The jump to the 3DS has easily made this the best-looking Rune Factory game yet. I can\'t lavish as much praise on the soundtrack, which doesn\'t have many memorable tunes outside of the opening theme and town theme. The character voices, on the other hand, are absolutely spot-on, although lines are voiced with disappointing infrequency, aside from passing greetings. The fact that I wanted to hear more should be a testament to how fitting the voices are. Suuuuper good morning to you too, Porcoline.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is a game I did not expect to like as much as I did, proving that it\'s nice to be wrong about things from time to time. Its addictive blend of farming, fighting, and friend-ing makes for a fun, lighthearted experience that\'s easy to get lost in for hours at a time. The series has never been this polished and accessible, so even if you weren\'t in love with earlier titles, Rune Factory 4 is still worth a look. Evidently, it\'s never too late to teach an old Wooly new tricks.\n\n\n\n© 2013 XSEED, Marvelous AQL.

It's action-packed, and approachable (at least as far as MOBAs go).\n\n\n\nSee Gigantic on the Windows Store\n\n\n\nSee Gigantic Starter Pack on the Windows Store\n\n\n\nGame modes\n\n\n\nGigantic is a multiplayer-only online game. Before you can play with others, you need to complete a tutorial. It lasts about 20 to 25 minutes and explains the various combat mechanics and how matches work.\n\n\n\nAlthough the tutorial is pretty good, the default volume level is too quiet and there are no subtitles, so you might miss some important information if you don't adjust the volume first. A few of the instructions (such as how to upgrade creatures) are a bit too vague, but otherwise it prepares you for your first match.\n\n\n\nAll matches in Gigantic are five versus five. Your initial few matches will be limited to bot matches, though – five human players against a team of bots. That's definitely the right way to get used to the game, as the bot difficulty is quite reasonable. My matchmade teams win most of the bot matches we participate in. These victories get you player XP, or hero XP for the currently selected character.\n\n\n\nAfter completing enough bot matches to level up your player profile, you'll finally be able to join regular player versus player (PvP) matches. Gigantic only offers those two game types (as well as a practice mode), which is awfully limited compared to Smite's six or more modes. The basic PvP mode tends to be the main attraction of most MOBAs, but some different ways to play would certainly help keep Gigantic fresh. Now that the game has fully launched, let's hope a few more modes will be forthcoming.\n\n\n\nBattle of the giants\n\n\n\nGigantic is a third-person action and shooter-style MOBA. The big difference between this one and other MOBAs is right there in the title: the giants. Each of the two teams serves a gigantic creature called a guardian. Currently, there are only two guardians - a griffin and a naga (snake creature). Given the inherently cool concept of fighting alongside giants, it would be cool if the game added more guardians in the future.\n\n\n\nEach side's guardian stays at the base where members of that team spawn. Under normal circumstances, they don't do much besides attack any members of the opposing team who get too close. But as each team earns power points from kills and other tasks, the giants eventually take a more active role.\n\n\n\nWhen your points reach a certain total, your guardian will rampage and attack the other guardian and pin it down for a short time. At this point, the pinned guardian becomes vulnerable to player attacks. Deal enough damage before the enemy guardian gets up and you'll score a wound on it, moving one step closer to victory.\n\n\n\nWhen either guardian has only one wound left, the battle shifts to the Clash phase. Both guardians will move to the center of the arena, knocking down walls and changing the shape of the map. Each team still has to earn points to charge up their guardian's rampage, but it's definitely an exciting climax to the battle.\n\n\n\nCreatures and combat\n\n\n\nOn top of the gigantic creatures that determine the outcome of the battle, each side can also summon smaller creatures at certain points on the map. You can choose between three equipped creatures, which serve different functions like healing nearby players, highlighting nearby enemy players, and erecting gates that make it harder for enemies to move around your base. These creatures defend themselves in combat and can be leveled up once to improve their effectiveness. But they also provide power points to the enemy when killed, so they need to be defended as well.\n\n\n\nCombat in Gigantic involves the use of four primary skills (assigned to the bumpers and triggers when playing with a controller), a focus attack (a super move charged by killing enemies), and a dodge. Dashing and dodging consume stamina, so you can't just dodge like crazy. I feel like dodging should move you farther out of the way than it does, but you get used to the way it works.\n\n\n\nAll four of a hero's skills and their focus attack can be leveled up for the duration of the match with skill points earned as your team accomplishes objectives. Each skill has a total of four possible upgrades, but you can only choose two of them. This allows you to focus some characters' roles more on attack or support based on how you upgrade their skills. You can also just auto-spend individual skill points, but your build won't be as effective that way.\n\n\n\nHeroes, Fortune Cards, and in-game purchases\n\n\n\nAt launch, Gigantic features 19 playable heroes – and you can expect more to be added in the future. These encompass a variety of classes and combat styles, including melee, shooters, healers, stealthy assassins, and more.\n\n\n\nBeing a free-to-play MOBA, a rotating handful of heroes are freely available at any given time. If you want to keep a character for good, you'll have to buy them with in-game currency or via a paid DLC pack. Two members of a team can't play as the same hero, so you'll actually want to find a stable of five characters you can comfortably choose from when the need arises.\n\n\n\nNaturally, dedicated players can earn currency for free in a couple of ways, such as by winning matches. But Gigantic also has a clever mission system based on Fortune Cards. At any given time, you can have seven active cards. Completing a card's objective gets you XP and currency. You then get to replace it with your choice from three randomly drawn cards. That player choice makes Fortune Cards more enjoyable than typical mission systems found in other free-to-play games.\n\n\n\nOverall impression\n\n\n\nGigantic has always been a promising title, though its future was in doubt when developer Motiga ran into financial troubles a while back. Thankfully, the good folks at Perfect World stepped in to publish the game and secure its release. Now Gigantic is officially complete, though it will continue to grow with the release of new characters and content as time goes on.\n\n\n\nThe final game turned out really well, with tight gameplay and a great selection of characters. The matchmaking problems we experienced during the beta have cleared up too. That said, Gigantic needs more variety. With only three maps and two modes, it can get a little repetitive after a few hours. Hopefully those concerns will be addressed via future updates, because this game could certainly give Smite a run for its money if it ever catches up on volume. It's already a gigantic good time, so give it a try!\n\n\n\nGigantic is free on Xbox One and Windows 10, with full Xbox Play Anywhere support. If you want to buy some heroes straight away instead of relying on the rotating free set, you can choose from a few character packs. The Starter Pack sells for $9.99 and includes eight characters and other bonuses. The $29.99 Ultimate Pack includes access to all characters that will ever be released for the game, as well as additional bonuses like exclusive skins and boosts.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\nAction-packed online battles against enemy players or bots.\n\n\n\nA great art style with gorgeous characters, colors, and monsters.\n\n\n\nThe gigantic Guardians add a fun twist to traditional MOBA gameplay.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n\nOnly two modes and three maps at launch, so the game can get a little repetitive.\n\n\n\nI had a hard time finding a character I really liked to play.\n\n\n\nSome text is too small for couch players.\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nout of 5\n\n\n\nSee Gigantic on the Windows Store\n\n\n\nSee Gigantic Starter Pack on the Windows Store\n\n\n\nSee Gigantic Ultimate Pack on the Windows Store\n\n\n\nGigantic Ultimate Pack provided by the publisher for review.\n\n\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links.

I don’t mean that\n\n\n\ndisparagingly; taking a well executed idea and putting a unique spin on it can result in remarkable new things.\n\n\n\nFortunately Gigantic , the free-to-play MOBA/shooter hybrid from\n\n\n\ndeveloper Motiga, is a great example of something becoming more than the sum of its parts. Though it cribs unashamedly from titles like\n\n\n\nLeague of Legends\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nOverwatch\n\n\n\n, it has enough charm and sincerely compelling twists in the standard MOBA formula to stand tall on its own.\n\n\n\nYou can download Gigantic from Steam or from the Arc client for free.\n\n\n\nFamiliar gameplay with a gigantic twist\n\n\n\nGigantic-Screenshot-6.jpg\n\n\n\nGigantic is a third person MOBA combined with a squad based, objective securing shooter. The ultimate goal is to deal damage to the other team’s Guardian, a gigantic (Ohhhhh!) mythical creature. In order to do that, you need to build up your own creature’s strength by slaying foes, summoning magical creatures, and all around wrecking the other team.\n\n\n\nAfter your guardian is sufficiently powerful, it will attack the opposing team’s monster and make it vulnerable. This is where things get serious, because you have a limited window to attack the opposing guardian, and the other team will be doing everything they can to stop you. If you manage to wear down the guardian’s defenses it will become wounded, and everything resets. First team to wound the other team’s creature three times wins the match.\n\n\n\nGigantic-Screenshot-14.jpg\n\n\n\nIt sounds straightforward, and it is once you understand the mechanics. It’s easy to grasp but tricky to master, as victory involves point control, summons, and understanding of good ol’ character loadouts and class weaknesses/strengths.\n\n\n\nThere’s also optional character modification during matches which is an interesting twist. If you perform well, you’re awarded skill points you can spend on a branching tree for each of your skills.This allows for some on the fly character customization that varies with each battle. Paying attention to these upgrades can mean the difference between victory and defeat.\n\n\n\nSimilar to Overwatch , skills are mapped to the left and right mouse button, q, e, and an ultimate ability activated with the Ctrl key. Every character has profoundly different abilities and Ults as you would expect, and that variation is critical.\n\n\n\nThe cast\n\n\n\nGigantic-Screenshot-11.jpg\n\n\n\nA game of this genre (or blend of genres) lives and dies by its heroes and cast, and the eclectic collection of heroes in Gigantic does not disappoint. Though there are some very familiar characters (a robot that can turn into a chain gun turret and a multi armed transcendent person with orbs come to mind) there is also a remarkably diverse mix of characters and play types.\n\n\n\nThere is of course your standard DPS, tanks, and healers, but there’s also creative, divergent characters that stand out. From heavy hitting (but also healing) Zandora to the wand wielding, spell casting Mozu and the amphibious ninja Wu, each character looks and plays different. As of now there are 19 heroes, but empty boxes in the character select screen means there’s almost certainly more coming, and I’m looking forward to that.\n\n\n\nVariation is great and all, but in a game like this balance is absolutely critical. Easier said than done. In the many hours I played Gigantic I did notice some character loadouts that were a little more effective than they should be against others, but the game has only been out a week. It’s far from broken, and overall I rarely felt frustrated. I’m sure Motiga will continue to tweak and fine tune the balance as more people join.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of Gigantic , and what really surprised me, is the incredibly satisfying movement. Each character has a dramatically different rate of speed and movement style. For example, the robot Bastio- I mean HK-206, moves with tank treads, carving across the landscape like he’s on metal skis. My personal favorite character, Tripp, runs incredibly fast and leaps through the air before attacking ferociously with her twin lighting blades. Taking every character for a spin in the training program to learn their skills and the way they move was a real pleasure.\n\n\n\nI almost wish there was a single player mode with larger levels and PvE, that’s how much I enjoyed simply moving around the environments. I’ve never encountered that level of satisfaction from movement in this style of game before, and it’s one of the things I like most about Gigantic .\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\n\nGigantic-Screenshot-10.jpg\n\n\n\nGigantic has a heavily stylized, cartoony aesthetic that works. Not only does this style look good and fit the tone of the game, but it has the added benefit of aging better than more realistic aesthetics. Arguably more important, this graphical style also allows it to run on lower end PCs which is important for a free-to-play title.\n\n\n\nI tested Gigantic on an older laptop running a 765M, as well as a new laptop with a 1070 and a 120Hz refresh rate display.\n\n\n\nIt ran well and looked great on both systems, though I was a bit disappointed by the limited video options. My 21:9 resolution monitor was not supported, and when trying to play on the 1070 laptop I had issues getting it to stay at 1920x1080 and not windowed. It kept wanting to drop resolution. Looks like there’s still a bit more polishing to do from a performance perspective, but that’s what patches are for.\n\n\n\nFree to play\n\n\n\nGigantic-Screenshot-2.jpg\n\n\n\nGigantic is free to play, but it’s not draconian in its implementation of that business model. I had no issues spending time grinding for new cosmetics, and never felt as though I were being held hostage behind some greedy paywall.\n\n\n\nFull disclosure, we were provided with the Ultimate Pack ($30) which provided access to all of the heroes and a few other goodies. The true freemium version will only provide access to some characters, and you'll have to unlock the others.\n\n\n\nPart of what makes this freemium model tolerable is the Fortune Card system.\n\n\n\nUnlocking these cards can provide substantial amounts of in game currency, and are fulfilled by completing specific challenges like getting a pre-determined number of kills with a certain character, or completing a set amount of games. Unlocking these cards allows you access to more, and it’s a great way to keep you feeling like you’re accomplishing something other than grinding for in-game currency. It also encouraged me to try out other characters, which I have a tendency not to do once I find someone I like.\n\n\n\nYou can spend real money on everything if you’re the impatient type, but there is a great deal of free content here to get you started. Freemium is an understandably controversial business model, and I’ve seen it seriously detract from otherwise good games, but with this game Motiga handled it right.\n\n\n\nGigantic potential\n\n\n\nGigantic-Screenshot-1.jpg\n\n\n\nGigantic feels familiar but new, like a fresh pair of shoes in the same size. The combination of elements from other games, partnered with a distinct visual flair, excellent controls, and satisfying movement adds up to a surprisingly fresh and compelling experience.\n\n\n\nIt may not be the most original game, but it’s really fun to play and the price is certainly right. I’m looking forward to checking back in with Gigantic in a few months, and hope to see it continually supported.\n\n\n\nComponent Solution\n\n\n\nCombo\n\n\n\nSold by: Newegg\n\n\n\nGraphics Card\n\n\n\nGIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1080 Ti...\n\n\n\n$649.99\n\n\n\nAdd to cart\n\n\n\nMotherboard\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\nRam\n\n\n\nCORSAIR Vengeance RGB DRAM 32GB...\n\n\n\n$329.99\n\n\n\nAdd to cart\n\n\n\nProcessor\n\n\n\nIntel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake...\n\n\n\n$339.99\n\n\n\nAdd to cart\n\n\n\nItem has been added to cart\n\n\n\nGIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1080 Ti DirectX 12 GV-N108TGAMING OC-11GD 11GB 352-Bit GDDR5X PCI Express 3.0 x16 ATX Video Card\n\n\n\n$649.99\n\n\n\nQuantity: 1\n\n\n\nCheckout at newegg\n\n\n\nBack to GameCrate Shop at Newegg\n\n\n\nItem has been added to cart\n\n\n\nIntel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake Quad-Core 4.2 GHz LGA 1151 91W BX80677I77700K Desktop Processor\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\nQuantity: 1\n\n\n\nCheckout at newegg\n\n\n\nBack to GameCrate Shop at Newegg\n\n\n\nItem has been added to cart\n\n\n\nCORSAIR Vengeance RGB DRAM 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4 3000 (PC4-24000) C15 - Intel 100/200 Series Desktop Memory\n\n\n\n$329.99\n\n\n\nQuantity: 1\n\n\n\nCheckout at newegg\n\n\n\nBack to GameCrate Shop at Newegg\n\n\n\nItem has been added to cart\n\n\n\nIntel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake Quad-Core 4.2 GHz LGA 1151 91W BX80677I77700K Desktop Processor\n\n\n\n$339.99\n\n\n\nQuantity: 1\n\n\n\nCheckout at newegg\n\n\n\nBack to GameCrate Shop at Newegg\n\n\n\nGAME INFO\n\n\n\nReviewed:\n\n\n\nJul 26, 2017\n\n\n\n7.75\n\n\n\nGigantic is an entertaining combination of a MOBA and a team based shooter, and what it lacks in originality it makes up for in charm and polished controls.\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nGameplay\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nThink Overwatch combined with League of Legends and you have some idea of what Gigantic is all about.

Its characters challenge, but they’re not ultra demanding. Its multi-phase battles require strategy and teamwork, but you don’t have to be a master tactician to succeed. It takes time to learn, but we’re talking weeks instead of months. The drawback is that its short, rapid-fire matches risk retreading the same ground a bit too often.\n\n\n\nThere’s currently only one way to play Gigantic: a 5v5 battle where teams must gather energy to power the massive monsters that sit on either side of the arena. These Guardians are far more interesting than ordinary MOBA objectives because they’re active participants rather than stationary punching bags, and the few times they battle each other during a match are always exciting. Watching one swoop in from its perch, wrestle its rival to the ground, and expose the weak point for its team to attack is really cool, and I wished they’d spend more time in action instead of holding back.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nEvery battle plays out in two phases, each one fun in its own regard. First is the main phase, a fun but familiar mode in which teams gather power and battle each other over objectives. It follows more of a Counter-Strike or Battlefield’s Conquest format, rewarding for kills as well as territories controlled, rather than a typical MOBA where control is king. The action can get repetitive, but that balance of objectives makes the main phase of Gigantic enjoyable despite its familiarity. The constant back-and-forth of claiming these territories kept me on my toes as I watched the power meters rise.\n\n\n\n“\n\n\n\nRampage transforms the match into a more traditional MOBA style.\n\n\n\nThe second phase, Rampage, transforms the match into a more traditional MOBA style of pushing toward the enemy’s side of the map, except that Gigantic’s original twist is to have one fully powered Guardian make its way across the map to attack and incapacitate its rival. The action becomes heated as every player makes a mad dash toward the two beasts, with one team focusing on the vulnerable Guardian while the other defends, unleashing all their abilities in a confined space. However, they only last a short period before reverting back to the main phase, and that brevity lessens the Rampages’ effectiveness. I also wish Rampages weren’t reserved for the same two spots on each map, as it’s odd seeing the struggles of powerful beasts like these happen in the same locations every time.\n\n\n\nAfter five Rampages without a victor comes the Clash, an endgame state which changes the battlefield to ensure matches don’t go on too long by opening new pathways and moving all objectives closer together. This creates more consistent action and quicker power-gathering. The Sanctum Falls arena during a Clash stands out for me, as it transforms from the largest map in Gigantic to the smallest in an instant. The action of Clash makes me wonder why it isn’t the default game mode, as it makes the main phase seem tame by comparison.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nGigantic throws an extra layer of strategy into the battle through tiny beings called Creatures with useful abilities that can be spawned from specific objective points. One might create a tree creature that heals nearby teammates, while another spawns a cyclops who builds walls to block paths; those extra powers give more importance to the decision of which points a team should concentrate on holding, depending on their strategy. These spawned helpers are also damage sponges, giving you plenty of time to come to their rescue. As the battle rages you can upgrade them to a more powerful form, making them even more important in battle and widening your options. If a healer isn’t available and I’m near death I know I can retreat to my creature and heal up.\n\n\n\n“\n\n\n\nOnly the Sanctum Falls map features something interesting.\n\n\n\nThe arenas you fight in are bright and filled with color but otherwise aren’t exciting. The Ghost Reef is a canyon dotted with abandoned technology, while Siren’s Stand is an icy tundra sporting a few shipwrecks – you’d think those unique features would create a distinctive feel to gameplay, but they don’t actually do anything except serve as background decor and have no memorable interactivity. Only Sanctum Falls features something interesting, with underwater areas that slow you down and inflict damage while you’re underwater, but even they are easily avoided and sometimes completely ignored.\n\n\n\nLikewise, the roster of 19 heroes (of which a rotating selection are available to play for free, in the League of Legends model) checks all of the traditional MOBA boxes in a fairly generic way. There’s a tank in The Margrave, melee specialists like the bull Lord Knossos, the fast but weak assassin in Tripp, and long-range spell casters like the mage Mozu. Some designs are cool, with the potion-happy Uncle Sven and the dragon sorcerer Charnok being personal favorites, but otherwise very few of these warriors stand out on the selection page.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nThe heroes do become more interesting in battle, though, thanks to a leveling system that’s more in-depth than most MOBAs. Each hero levels up and gains new abilities throughout a match, but Gigantic gives more choice here than most in that each ability has two tiers of perks, and each tier has two branching choices. The robot HK-206’s Bullet Barrage, for example, offers either a higher rate of fire or armor-piercing rounds at Tier 1. At Tier 2, choices depend on what you chose first: If you picked high rate of fire, you can upgrade it with either more close-range damage or the ability to slow enemies with each hit.\n\n\n\nThat’s a level of customization not seen in similar games (those without gear shops, at least), and experimentation is rewarding and reveals new roles for each of the 19 characters. Uncle Sven starts out as a standard healer, but by enhancing his Fire Flask with increased direct-hit damage and the ability to cause Burning damage over time you can make him an effective mid-range attacker as well. Being able to choose perks on the fly also allows you to adapt to the flow of each individual match, giving you an awesome power over your characters.\n\n\n\n“\n\n\n\nAccessing the clunky upgrade menu renders your character defenseless.\n\n\n\nThe problem with this perk system is the actual process of selecting each one. Accessing the clunky upgrade menu renders your character defenseless, so you can’t safely choose a new perk unless you’re waiting to respawn or you’ve retreated from action to find a quiet spot and sacrificed your momentum. The menu itself is irritating because it doesn’t always respond to button presses, which can make getting to my intended perk (and thus the period of vulnerability) take even longer. I fell victim to more than a few ambushes because of that, which isn’t great even if the upgrade system is impressive.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nAll of that nuance sounds intimidating, but Gigantic does a great job of teaching the ins and outs. The mandatory tutorial clearly and effectively lays the rules out, more so than others in my experience. Once that’s out of the way, the Practice Arena lets you tinker with each character to your heart’s content, or you can play as many bot matches as you wish before jumping into the real deal. Where other MOBAs are sometimes more keen to throw new players to the wolves, Gigantic makes a real effort to provide ample opportunity to learn it, making me feel more engaged in the process.\n\n\n\nGigantic is a free-to-play game, so naturally in-game currency is a thing and can be purchased. However, the Fortune Card challenge system makes earning money for unlocking new characters and skins more fun than the standard grind. Each card you get comes with a challenge to complete, ranging from easy ones like inflicting X amount of damage on a Guardian to tougher character-specific challenges and straightforward ones like hitting a certain level with your account. Having those achievement-like objectives tied to in-game cash rewards makes earning more feel like less of a chore.\n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\nBalancing the objective-based main phase with the rushed and frantic giant monster-powered Rampage phase gives Gigantic a fast and distinctive pace that separates it from the MOBA crowd. Having to choose perks so frequently using the clumsy menu causes a lot of dumb deaths, but there are enough good ideas within each battle to keep it interesting – hopefully until more modes come along to prevent the one currently available from becoming stale.

Nothing special.\n\n\n\nBut I was wrong. And after a couple of hours of exploring its systems — which include multiple kinds of crafting, farming and even dating, I was hooked. It only took a few in-game days for Rune Factory 4 to turn me into an obsessive, monster-hunting, weapon-crafting lunatic.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 begins on an airship, transporting your hero — a young man or woman — to the pastel-hued town of Selphia. A couple of gangster soldiers hijack the ship, and you fall (literally) into town with a wicked case of amnesia. From here, you serve as a member of the community — operating a farm, interacting with townsfolk and running out into nearby fields and dungeons to slay monsters.\n\n\n\nThe narrative is simple, with a focus on the quirky characters of Selphia and an arc that centers on themes of friendship and loyalty alongside the more typical ""save the world"" heroics. It isn\'t ground-breaking, but it works as a premise for the main draw — the series\' signature gameplay.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is a marriage of farm/town simulator and action-RPG. I spent much of my time in my own field — planting, tending to my crops, selling the extras, caring for my barn of ""monster"" animals and running around town raising my ""friendship"" level with the townsfolk. Much of this half of the game is concerned with crafting — you can buy ""recipes"" for food, weapons and gear, medicines and more, all yielding benefits in the more action-oriented combat half.\n\n\n\nThe rest of my time was spent in oppressive mazes, forests and mountains, slaying thousands of beasts, collecting the items they dropped, and facing off against boss characters. It\'s vanilla hack-and-slash, but the speed at which you level up — and the promise of crafting newer, better gear with the item drops — made for an addicting experience.\n\n\n\nThe speed at which you level up made for an addicting experience\n\n\n\nTaken separately, Rune Factory 4 \'s main gameplay modes are perfectly serviceable. But the game integrates its systems so well that the overall experience drew me in and didn\'t let go until I was obsessed with my character\'s progression in the world. I would spend ""mornings"" in my farm, cook a bunch of tasty dishes in preparation for an afternoon of monster bashing, and head out to slay beasts. I would collect crystals, skulls and other paraphernalia with which to level up my weapons and armor.\n\n\n\nGender bummer\n\n\n\nThe very first action set before me was a choice between two dialogue options: ""I\'m flying\' high, baby!"" and ""Goodness, I\'m so high up!"" I chose the more daring option, and the game informed me that this selection denotes a male player character. uh-oh.\n\n\n\nTo play as a woman, I had to go back to the original choice and select the daintier ""Goodness, I\'m so high up."" I appreciated that the option to play as a female protagonist (a first for the series) was included. And Rune Factory 4 \'s cast includes a number of nuanced, strong women — chief among them, Forte, a badass knight with a sweet tooth. But that initial choice put me off immediately.\n\n\n\nSome days I would just spend fishing and sell my catches. Others, I would talk to townsfolk and give ""presents"" to the eligible bachelors and bachelorettes (though same-sex marriage hasn\'t made its way to Selphia yet, sadly). There\'s enough to see and do — and craft and kill — in Rune Factory 4 to fill hundreds of hours.\n\n\n\nNot all of those hours will be equally exciting, however. There\'s a lot of level grinding in Rune Factory 4 , and not just on the combat side. In order to unlock new crafting recipes, you need to level your skills as a blacksmith, chef, farmer and alchemist — which means spending lots of time with low-level crafting until you get to the good stuff. I had to make dozens of onigiri — the lowest level rice recipe — until I was able to really dive in to the finer (read: higher HP-yielding) dishes. This slow burn across every imaginable skill got tedious, especially when I found myself making useless items just to fill my progress meter.\n\n\n\nThis grinding bloats the game unnecessarily. Given that there are multiple story arcs and a tremendous deal of content to work through, Rune Factory 4 doesn\'t need any padding. It certainly doesn\'t ruin the experience — the gameplay systems are fun to engage with — but it does make the game much longer than it needed to be.\n\n\n\nWrap Up:\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is worth the grind\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is a time sink. I spent dozens of hours grinding for better gear, better recipes and the opportunity to tackle more exciting challenges. But the game earned that commitment from me, offering an almost unlimited sense of progression, and mechanics that blended together into a cohesive, addicting whole. I spent 70 plus hours in Selphia — and I could\'ve easily spent 70 more.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 was reviewed using a downloadable code provided by the publisher.

At its core, it\'s still very much a Harvest Moon game and shares many similarities to that long-running franchise. The big difference is Rune Factory has combat. Between bouts of farming cabbage and milking cows, you\'re sent out to defeat monsters. Rune Factory is a family-friendly game, so every sword swipe sends the monsters home, rather than slaying them, and treasure chests can be full of boiled eggs and plant seeds or gold and ancient swords. Trying to mix the two play styles has led to some quirky titles. Rune Factory 4 is probably the least original of the lot, but it is also the most polished and accessible to date, and that counts for a lot.\n\n\n\nIn RF4 , players take control of either Lest (a boy) or Frey (a girl), a young person on the way to the city of Selphia. Their airship is ambushed by bandits who knock the protagonist on the head and send them off the side of the vessel. Fortunately, this occurs above the home of Ventuswill, the dragon who guards Selphia. The hero wakes up with amnesia and this causes Ventuswill and the townspeople to assume that he or she must be the royal heir who was supposed to take over the town. As the ruler of the town, you must do odd jobs and farm in addition to issuing royal decrees and living in a castle. Even when the actual prince shows up, he cedes the job to your hero since you\'ve been doing such a great job. There\'s a deeper plot involving the dragons, the gradual decline of magical ""runeys,"" and your character\'s true identity, but it is mostly done in a lighthearted way. It\'s a fun story with a few dark moments, and things almost always turn out for the best.\n\n\n\nSelphia is a thriving city, and there is a ton to do. You begin with a small farm behind the castle, and you can use it to begin a healthy and profitable farming business. As the game advances, you can get additional farms or expand the size of your original farm, get animal-like monsters to give you eggs, milk and honey, or use those animals as farm workers to automate some processes. It\'s very similar to Rune Factory 3 , but it\'s more polished. Soil quality and fertilizer are a major part of the game, but they\'re more for die-hard fans than casual players. Everyday players can farm to their heart\'s content without worrying about soil quality. Serious players will rotate crops to avoid damaging the soil or treat their crops with expensive fertilizer and growth potions to get the highest possible yield. It\'s nice that both sets of players can play the same game without any issues.\n\n\n\nYou can also craft by obtaining a forge, a kitchen set, a crafting table, and a chemistry lab, which allow you to create items. More complex items require you to level up skills by creating weaker items first; otherwise, they take an exorbitant amount of Rune Points (stamina) to make. Once you\'ve made items, you can start improving them. Using higher-quality material gives you a higher-quality base item, which has a higher resale value. You can also use materials to upgrade items with new attributes, higher stats, or other cool features. You can spend hours crafting the perfect set of equipment for your character, or you can turn it into a profitable business. Much of my early game money came from buying cheap wool supplies from a shopkeep and converting it into far more profitable yarn.\n\n\n\nAs always, the townspeople are a big part of the game. You can befriend almost everyone, and that unlocks abilities and side-quests. You can even have your character date and eventually marry one of the townsfolk in true Harvest Moon style. The translation is solid and imbues (almost) every character with a likeable personality. My favorite character was Arthur, the amusingly nerdy prince who would rather spend his days working on the local harvest report than attending to his royal duties.\n\n\n\nThe biggest new feature in RF4 involves royal duties. For just about every little thing you do, you unlock prince/princess points. If you do big things for townspeople, you\'ll get a bunch. If you take down monsters, you\'ll get a few for each defeated monster. These points are a measure of how much the townspeople will tolerate you declaring things on a whim. The more points you have, the more things you can do. You can get licenses to cook, forge, run a shop or drive an airship. You can order shops to sell certain items, that a festival be held, or that your backpack be upgraded. The more significant the order, the more PP it costs. It\'s a good system to encourage you to vary your mechanics because keeping everyone happy involves not focusing on one thing. You can still do that if you want, but it\'ll take longer to build up PP.\n\n\n\nPart of what makes Rune Factory fun is that you\'re not pigeonholed into doing one thing. You can spend a month running your personal shop or make a giant, sprawling farm and carefully balance the fertilizer levels and nutrients to get the best possible crops. You can become a blacksmith and make your money forging weapons and armor. You could adventure all the time and not worry about making stuff. You\'ll progress faster if you mix things up, but I never felt like I was being held back when I let medicine crafting fall by the wayside. It also wasn\'t difficult to get back into it once I picked it up again.\n\n\n\nRF4 has a lot of adventures. The game is packed with dungeons, both plot-related and optional. They\'re not overly complex but tend to have enough depth that it might take multiple days to complete one, especially later in the game. Combat uses a simple isometric style similar to the old-school Zelda games, and it largely involves swinging your weapon at enemies until they fall down. You can use anything from short-range daggers to massive broadswords and axes, each with varying speed and power. As you use weapons, you unlock the ability to charge them up for extra damage or unleash an ultimate attack that drains some of your RP but hits hard. You also unlock special rune skills that can be anything from fireballs to powerful swings of your sword but require a chunk of RP. Combat is fun, especially when you\'re trying to clear large rooms of enemies without getting hit, but it falls into some rote patterns after a while. There\'s only so much variety available with the combat system, and you\'ll probably fall back on the same few powers.\n\n\n\nYou can also invite your townsfolk friends to adventure in the dungeons with you, but you\'ll need to equip them, and that can be costly. On the other hand, you can also bring along any monsters you\'ve tamed to work on your farm. These monsters are weaker in the long run but can survive well on their own. It\'s also hilarious to see a pair of chickens brutalizing their way through a goblin encampment. You even can gain special buff songs that power up your allies or convince them to attack certain enemies, if you\'d prefer to not do the fighting.\n\n\n\nThe fun thing about Rune Factory is how these two elements combine. All the crafting, farming, making friends — pretty much everything you do in the game — contribute to your combat strength. There are stat levels for everything from swordplay to bathing to sleeping. The more you do, the higher your stats are. If you spend a lot of time crafting, befriending people, and growing crops, you\'ll get stronger as surely as if you punched enemies to grind levels. On the other hand, going into dungeons and fighting enemies allows you to do more in the social and crafting aspects. You unlock new characters for the town, new materials to use in crafting, and plot sequences that offer new opportunities or new places to farm. You\'re never stuck doing one thing for too long.\n\n\n\nRF4 isn\'t the best-looking title on the 3DS, unfortunately. The graphics are fine, but they\'re not a huge improvement over the original DS titles and can be a little muddy in spots. The character artwork retains the modern Harvest Moon style of ""everyone looks roughly 12 years old,"" which leads to some adorable art design but feels weird when marriage and romance come into play. The 3-D effect in this game is among the worst I\'ve seen on the 3DS. It\'s muddy and doesn\'t add any sense of depth. I strongly advise playing without the 3-D because it only detracts from the experience. The soundtrack is good but not very memorable.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is probably the most polished and well-crafted Rune Factory to date. It doesn\'t change the gameplay much, and that\'s sometimes to its detriment, but that also makes it a very accessible and enjoyable title. It\'s fun to play, regardless of whether you\'re crafting swords, running a high-yield farm, or battling monsters in a dungeon. There\'s always something to do, and it\'s always fun to do it. It has flaws, but none really take away from the overall experience, and there really isn\'t another game on the 3DS quite like it. If you\'re looking for an RPG where saving the world comes second to growing turnips, Rune Factory 4 is the game for you.\n\n\n\nScore: 8.0/10\n\n\n\nMore articles about\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\n\n\n\ncomments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\nblog comments powered by\n\n\n\nDisqus\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\n\nReviewers\n\n\n\nLatest Articles\n\n\n\n\'Aggelos\' (ALL) Update Adds Hard Mode, Langauge Localizations\n\n\n\nVarious Game Trailers #2734\n\n\n\nSwitch/PS4/XOne/PC Preview - \'Blacksad: Under the Skin\'\n\n\n\nPS4 Review - \'Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age\'\n\n\n\n\'8 to Glory: The Official Game of the PBR\' (ALL) Gets...\n\n\n\nEverything else\n\n\n\nJoin Us!\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n©2000-2018 Worthplaying', ""doctype html\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 Review - IGN\n\n\n\nBrowse\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nVita\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nMobile\n\n\n\nMovies\n\n\n\nTV\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\nComics\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nUpcoming\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nWikis + Cheats\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\n\nBoards\n\n\n\nTrailers\n\n\n\nIGN on YouTube\n\n\n\nIGN on Facebook\n\n\n\nIGN on Twitter\n\n\n\nMORE\n\n\n\nBrowse\n\n\n\nShows\n\n\n\nMonday through Friday\n\n\n\nDaily Fix\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Odyssey's Season Pass Has Free Games\n\n\n\nplay latest\n\n\n\nDaily Fix\n\n\n\nPrepare To Try\n\n\n\nHotKeys\n\n\n\nUp At Noon\n\n\n\nGame Scoop!\n\n\n\nBeyond!\n\n\n\nNintendo Voice Chat\n\n\n\nUnlocked\n\n\n\nmore shows\n\n\n\nFireteam Chat\n\n\n\nIGN Every Ever\n\n\n\nLinked Together\n\n\n\nIGN Spotlight\n\n\n\nIGN Unfiltered\n\n\n\nIGN Access\n\n\n\nIGN Plays\n\n\n\nEvery Thrs\n\n\n\nGame Scoop!\n\n\n\nGame Scoop's Take on Spider-Man PS4\n\n\n\nplay latest\n\n\n\nNew episodes every Saturday.\n\n\n\nPrepare To Try\n\n\n\nSave Solaire - Fighting Gwyn - Part 7\n\n\n\nplay latest\n\n\n\nEvery Friday\n\n\n\nNintendo Voice Chat\n\n\n\nOur Favorite New Switch Games This Week- NVC Highlight\n\n\n\nplay latest\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXbox\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nNintendo\n\n\n\nMovies\n\n\n\nTV\n\n\n\nTech\n\n\n\nEsports\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\nYou've Come This Far...\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\nIGN\n\n\n\nus\n\n\n\nBig Story\n\n\n\nTitans Exclusive Photos: Jason Todd Faces off with Dick Grayson\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nFrozen Synapse 2 Review\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 Review\n\n\n\nTrending Today\n\n\n\nFrozen Synapse 2 Review\n\n\n\nNBA 2K19 Review\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider Review\n\n\n\nNBA Live 19 Review\n\n\n\nTwo Point Hospital Review\n\n\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man PS4 Review\n\n\n\nDivinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition Review\n\n\n\nMonster Hunter Generations Ultimate Review\n\n\n\nFar Cry 5: Dead Living Zombies DLC Review\n\n\n\nThe Messenger Review\n\n\n\nDragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age Review\n\n\n\nPES 2019 Review\n\n\n\nStrange Brigade Review\n\n\n\nDonut County Review\n\n\n\nWorld of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth Review\n\n\n\nInnerSpace Review\n\n\n\nDeath's Gambit Review\n\n\n\nNintendo Labo Variety Kit Review\n\n\n\nF1 2018 Review\n\n\n\nReview by\n\n\n\nMeghan Sullivan\n\n\n\nNintendo Direct Footage (Japanese)\n\n\n\nReviewed on 3DS\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n18 Oct 2013 5:06 PM PDT\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4\n\n\n\nReview\n\n\n\nShare.\n\n\n\nMajestically good times.\n\n\n\nBy Meghan Sullivan\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is irresistibly charming. It has a plethora of things to do and a variety of ways to do them, and features some lovely graphics and catchy tunes. Those charms are slightly tarnished by the paper-thin plot, uneven pacing, and an under-utilized monarchy system, but even with a few smudges on its noble crown, Rune Factory 4 rules.\n\n\n\nThe story is fairly straightforward. As a hero (or heroine) you literally drop into the small town of Selphia after a scuffle on an airship leaves with you with amnesia, where you’re mistaken for royalty and asked to rule the town and help turn it into a popular tourist destination. Without any real reason to say no, your hero proceeds to spend their time doing some serious multitasking.\n\n\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\n\nMultitasking is definitely the key word here, because there's a lot to do in Rune Factory 4. Activities include fishing, farming, cooking, crafting, exploring dungeons, running a store, fighting and taming monsters, (deep breath) issuing orders, running errands, participating in festivals, and wooing one of Selphia's eligible bachelors or bachelorettes. Keep in mind that almost all of these things cost you Rune energy (the Rune Factory equivalent of magic points), so you'll not only have to manage your time carefully, you’ll also have to ensure you don't overexert yourself. A little exhaustion is well worth it though, as doing multiple tasks in the space of a single day is incredibly rewarding.\n\n\n\nThe Rune Factory series is a spin-off of Harvest Moon, so it’s no surprise that one of the most enjoyable tasks in Rune Factory 4 is farming. Besides tilling the land, planting seeds, watering crops and harvesting them at the right time, you can also inspect the quality of the soil and use items to protect your fields from damaging storms. Once you’ve reaped what you’ve sown, you can then sell your bounty for money, or turn veggies into tasty dishes that can be consumed for energy or given to one of the townspeople to improve your friendship with them. It’s an involved process that can get repetitive at times, but it ultimately proves rewarding when the cash and compliments from NPCs start rolling in.\n\n\n\nCombat is also rewarding, with fast-paced action and easy-to-understand mechanics that allow you to equip weapons, spells and abilities by simply mapping them to one of four assigned slots (the X, Y, RY and RX buttons). You can also swap them out at any time by opening up the in-game menu with a quick press of the left shoulder button. This is an especially handy feature when you need to change your strategy on the fly, which happens a lot since Rune Factory 4 features some pretty tough enemies. But don’t worry, you won’t always have to fight them. Like previous Rune Factory games, almost all the monsters you encounter are tamable. All you have to do is figure out the right food or items to give them (which requires a bit of trial and error). Once you’ve made a new friend, you can order them to follow you into battle or send them home, where they’ll help out with the farmwork. Some even produce useful items that you can craft things from, so it’s worth making a few furry friends.\n\n\n\nFarming and fighting are great, but the best part of Rune Factory 4 is its surprisingly in-depth romances. There are six eligible bachelors or bachelorettes in town for you to choose from, each with their own likes, dislikes and background story. All have wonderfully quirky personalities (thanks to XSEED’s excellent localization and some fantastic voice acting), which makes pursuing residents an addictive past-time. After you’ve captured a person’s heart, you can go on dates and attend festivals together, and even marry and start a family. It’s fantastic fun.\n\n\n\nWhat isn't very fun is the responsibility of being royalty, which is all busywork and no pageantry or amusing abuses of power. You'd think issuing orders from on high would be a blast, but Rune Factory 4 refuses to let you use your accumulated Prince/Princess points (awarded for doing various tasks) for anything other than expanding the town to attract tourists or improving your personal property, making the whole sovereign thing a bit of a bore. It’s true that you can at least assign farm work to your pets, but most of the time you'll be running around doing errands like a commoner instead of enjoying your royal prerogative to delegate these menial tasks to the lowly peasants beneath you. This makes the monarchy system feel like a wasted opportunity, which is a shame because given a little more imagination, it could have been something special.\n\n\n\nSome Rune Factory fans might not mind being a powerless figurehead, but they may be frustrated by some initial foot-dragging. The obligatory 10-hour tutorial is a real chore to get through, only somewhat helped by a Request Box full of tasks that pass the time until something interesting happens. And you'll be waiting a long time for something interesting to happen, since the story doesn't really get going until the second half of the campaign, and even then it falls a little flat.\n\n\n\nLuckily there’s so much to do that the sluggish pacing and gauzy story can be forgiven. As previously mentioned, the fun doesn’t stop and at just farming and fighting. You can walk to the nearest body of water and fish for food, make clothes, armor and weapons that will raise your stats in battle, and participate in goofy festivals like sheering a giant sheep or catching squid. You can even plant your very own dungeon and explore it (which yields rare items).\n\n\n\nThe Verdict\n\n\n\nWith dozens of hours of gameplay (and the option of playing well after the story ends) Rune Factory 4 is definitely a good time. Just be prepared to pack your patience and reign in your expectations of what wearing a crown means. You'll still be toiling in the fields like everybody else, but at least you can do so with a smile on your face.\n\n\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4\n\n\n\nReleased Oct. 1st, 2013\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nGreat\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is a great game that’s jam-packed with fun things to do.\n\n\n\n18 Oct 2013\n\n\n\nFun gameplay\n\n\n\nLots to do\n\n\n\nGreat romance system\n\n\n\nBland story\n\n\n\nWeak monarchy system\n\n\n\n8.0\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nRead our review standards\n\n\n\nBuying Guide\n\n\n\nPowered by IGN Deals\n\n\n\nWiki Guide\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 Starter Guide\n\n\n\nWalkthrough\n\n\n\nNorad Express, Welcome to Selphia, First Morning, An Audience, Princely Power,\n\n\n\nCharacters\n\n\n\nAmber, Bassett, Blossom, Clorica, Doug, Dylas,\n\n\n\n75 Pages\n\n\n\nIGN Recommends\n\n\n\nAll of the News, Trailers and Gameplay from September 13’s Nintendo Direct\n\n\n\nDick Grayson and Jason Todd Face Off in Our Exclusive Titans First Look\n\n\n\nLet's Talk About That Insane Nintendo Direct\n\n\n\nNintendo Cloud Save Data Is Deleted if Your Subscription Expires\n\n\n\nVenom Movie Rating and Runtime Revealed\n\n\n\nUpdate: Final Fantasy Games Coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox One\n\n\n\nFans Are Trying to Figure Out What's in PS4's Mysterious New Update\n\n\n\nTommy's Powers Are on the Fritz in Power Rangers: Soul of the Dragon\n\n\n\n© 1996-2018 Ziff Davis, LLC\n\n\n\nJoin the IGN Newsletter\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nAdChoices\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY .\n\n\n\n×"", ""html\n\n\n\nGigantic Review – A Featherweight Competitor - Game Informer\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\nMain navigation\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nPreviews\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nJoin\n\n\n\nSign In\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nHamburger Menu\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nPreviews\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nHubs\n\n\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 4, October Cover Story\n\n\n\nColumns\n\n\n\nThe GI Show Podcast\n\n\n\nNew Gameplay Today\n\n\n\nReplay\n\n\n\nThe Vault\n\n\n\nContests\n\n\n\nMagazine\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nApps\n\n\n\nCover Gallery\n\n\n\nManage My Subscription\n\n\n\nHelp/Customer Service\n\n\n\nJoin\n\n\n\nSign In\n\n\n\nReview\n\n\n\nGigantic\n\n\n\nA Featherweight Competitor\n\n\n\nby Suriel Vazquez on Jul 28, 2017 at 03:26 PM\n\n\n\nPublisher:\n\n\n\nPerfect World\n\n\n\nDeveloper:\n\n\n\nMotiga\n\n\n\nRelease:\n\n\n\nJuly 20, 2017\n\n\n\nRating:\n\n\n\nTeen\n\n\n\nReviewed on:\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nAlso on:\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nPost\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\nIn a genre as crowded as the MOBA, games live or die in the details. Because of their extended learning curves, these minor difference matter more than in most other kinds of games. Though Gigantic ticks off many of the boxes that players might want from a MOBA, it also removes many of the nuances to make itself more accessible. As a result, it’s a middle-of-the-road experience that doesn’t provide the crushing lows and triumphant highs that can make MOBAs so rewarding.\n\n\n\nRather than make a series of drawn-out pushes toward an objective, teams in Gigantic fight over multiple rounds for a resource called power. Teams earn power by killing enemies, summoning creatures (which also provide healing, radar, or defensive walls), or harvesting it from predetermined points around the map. The first team to gather 100 power gets the chance to attack the enemy Guardian, the main objective. This structure removes the early “laning” phase of the MOBA (when players on both sides sit in the same area soaking up experience just by being near creeps), and makes Gigantic an easily accessible game. I like that you have an immediate incentive to group up, summon creatures, and pick off enemies. Health and stamina regenerate quickly outside of battle, which means you’re constantly in the thick of combat, and I appreciated the change of pace.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the MOBA and third-person-shooter elements interfere with each other, leading to long engagements that lack weight. MOBAs make their characters beefy enough to survive a few special attacks and have a chance to escape, while third-person shooter characters can usually only take a few hits before dying. Gigantic sits somewhere in between these two extremes, which results in opponents attacking and using their special abilities on each other for extended periods of time. This makes each attack and character ability lack impact, so the initial rush of entering a fight fades long before the encounter ends.\n\n\n\nThis slow pace extends to matches as a whole, which often feel like wars of attrition. Because Guardians have three health bars to chip away at, even lopsided games take longer than they should. Additionally, collected power becomes a shield for a Guardian when it’s vulnerable to attack, so a team can win a round and have little Guardian damage to show for it. This makes longer matches feel like a chore, and the same combat loops aren’t entertaining over that extended timeframe.\n\n\n\nAll of the 19 characters have their own attacks, special powers, and a Focus ability that builds up over a longer period of time. A few characters have creative ideas tied to them (Aisling can summon the spirit of her father to fight for her as a separate character in battle), but most tend to have the standard MOBA skillset, with different characters specializing in damage, movement, or utility. Many abilities that disable or lock the enemy in place don’t last long, making them weak and ineffective for setting up combos. Unless you become attached to a particular character’s look (and the vibrant art style definitely helps), you won’t find characters that beg you to invest in them.\n\n\n\nA bigger issue is that characters don’t seem to interact with each other in interesting ways; though some have toolsets that work in tandem with themselves, I never discovered ways to work with my teammates beyond being in the same place at the same time. One of the best parts of MOBAs or other character-based multiplayer games is coming up with powerful combos or tricks that require coordination to pull off. I never found that here. Team fights don’t have much variety beyond everyone throwing out their most powerful skills, holding down the attack button, and hoping for the best.\n\n\n\nGigantic is an accessible MOBA that admirably scales the genre down, but loses the magic that makes the genre so enticing. It lacks many of the myriad ability and character interactions that make learning these kinds of games so much fun, and the combat doesn’t find a comfortable center between MOBA and third-person action. The round-based structure may facilitate some back-and-forth matches, mostly makes matches longer than they need to be. While it might be an easy introduction to a complicated market, Gigantic doesn’t have the staying power to be more than a stepping stone to better, deeper offerings.\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nGame Informer's Review System\n\n\n\nConcept\n\n\n\nSimplify or remove many of the MOBA genre’s key aspects to create a combat-oriented brawler/shooter hybrid\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\n\nEach map and character is colorful, detailed, and gorgeous, though few of the character designs are memorable\n\n\n\nSound\n\n\n\nTried-and-true orchestral swells, chords, horns, and strings accentuate the action but won’t get stuck in your head\n\n\n\nPlayability\n\n\n\nThe control scheme maps well to a controller or keyboard, but combat feels lightweight and unsatisfying\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nThough its changes to the MOBA standard are creative, the multi-round structure leads to drawn-out matches\n\n\n\nReplay\n\n\n\nModerate\n\n\n\nSuriel Vazquez\n\n\n\nAssociate Editor\n\n\n\nSuriel plays a lot of Dota and fighting games and likes to watch other people play them.

A lot can change over three months, however, and it seems that at least some of my issues with the first part have been addressed?although this DLC add-on is still far from perfect.\n\n\n\nMech Land Assault opens up with Rico stumbling across a cargo plane being loaded with prisoners (as evidenced by their orange jumpsuits), and gets word from his old buddy, Tom Sheldon, that international mercenary group The Black Hand have been rounding up prisoners like this for weeks. Knowing the Black Hand can?t be up to anything good, Rico stows away aboard the plane and uses it to sneak through the protected airspace of an island just to the north of Medici. Here, Rico will uncover a Black Hand plot that involves an abandoned eDEN research station (bringing back unsavory elements from the last DLC), as he tries to free the Black Hand?s captives and get to the bottom of the illegal operation.\n\n\n\nAs usual, the story is really just an excuse for you to blow more stuff up in the open world Avalanche Studios has created. The true main draw for this DLC is that, as part of Black Hand?s operation on this new island, they?ve retrofitted advanced gravity-wielding construction equipment with auto-cannons, and are using them as makeshift walking tanks. Early on, Rico gets his hands on one of these new mechs?and, suddenly, you have your greatest chaos-causing weapon yet.\n\n\n\nEach mech can send out a powerful shockwave, as well as rip objects up from the ground (like prison walls and trees), turning them into deadly projectiles. My personal favorite, though, was lifting up a goat and launching it several hundred feet off a cliff?a great ride, at least until you get to the landing. This is the kind of mindless fun that has always been at the core of the Just Cause experience, and I?m always amazed at the new goodies Avalanche Studios continues to come up with, not to mention how seamlessly they are integrated into the game?s pre-existing open world.\n\n\n\nAnother plus with Mech Land Assault is that, while the gravity gun may seem all-powerful, it is actually very well balanced with the world around you?especially when facing off against other gravity tanks. Unlike Sky Fortress ?s jetpack, which made you almost god-like in that DLC (and actually still comes in handy at several points here), your mech is still susceptible to the ever-present danger posed by the Black Hand and their occupying force. The new island Rico finds himself on may be full of plenty of things to wreck with your new toy, but this vulnerability provides a challenge that only makes the experience more enjoyable overall.\n\n\n\nWhere Mech Land Assault begins to stumble is reminiscent of where Sky Fortress also ran into problems: a clear lack of content being offered. While you do get the benefit of being able to take your mech tank back into the main portion of Just Cause 3 , one new vehicle and a small additional island are meager offerings in a for-pay DLC pack. All told, Mech Land Assault does add a dozen or so new outposts to be liberated, but with only two story missions and two gear challenges, you can one-hundred percent this add-on in two and a half hours maximum. There?s also then the fact that the few cut scenes presented for the story missions are, once again, just art stills accompanied by voiceover.\n\n\n\nJust Cause 3: Mech Land Assault is a fun little add-on for Avalanche Studios? latest sandbox adventure, but considering the overall lack of content and its relatively steep price point, you might need to be really desperate to get back into Just Cause 3 if you?re using this as your excuse. Still, what is here is enjoyable, and much better balanced than what we saw in Sky Fortress , showing Avalanche Studios is at least moving in the right direction with this post-launch content?and giving me hope for the final chapter in the three-part DLC season pass.\n\n\n\nDeveloper: Avalanche Studios ? Publisher: Square Enix ? ESRB: M – Mature ?

A lot can change over three months, however, and it seems that at least some of my issues with the first part have been addressed?although this DLC add-on is still far from perfect.\n\n\n\nMech Land Assault opens up with Rico stumbling across a cargo plane being loaded with prisoners (as evidenced by their orange jumpsuits), and gets word from his old buddy, Tom Sheldon, that international mercenary group The Black Hand have been rounding up prisoners like this for weeks. Knowing the Black Hand can?t be up to anything good, Rico stows away aboard the plane and uses it to sneak through the protected airspace of an island just to the north of Medici. Here, Rico will uncover a Black Hand plot that involves an abandoned eDEN research station (bringing back unsavory elements from the last DLC), as he tries to free the Black Hand?s captives and get to the bottom of the illegal operation.\n\n\n\nAs usual, the story is really just an excuse for you to blow more stuff up in the open world Avalanche Studios has created. The true main draw for this DLC is that, as part of Black Hand?s operation on this new island, they?ve retrofitted advanced gravity-wielding construction equipment with auto-cannons, and are using them as makeshift walking tanks. Early on, Rico gets his hands on one of these new mechs?and, suddenly, you have your greatest chaos-causing weapon yet.\n\n\n\nEach mech can send out a powerful shockwave, as well as rip objects up from the ground (like prison walls and trees), turning them into deadly projectiles. My personal favorite, though, was lifting up a goat and launching it several hundred feet off a cliff?a great ride, at least until you get to the landing. This is the kind of mindless fun that has always been at the core of the Just Cause experience, and I?m always amazed at the new goodies Avalanche Studios continues to come up with, not to mention how seamlessly they are integrated into the game?s pre-existing open world.\n\n\n\nAnother plus with Mech Land Assault is that, while the gravity gun may seem all-powerful, it is actually very well balanced with the world around you?especially when facing off against other gravity tanks. Unlike Sky Fortress ?s jetpack, which made you almost god-like in that DLC (and actually still comes in handy at several points here), your mech is still susceptible to the ever-present danger posed by the Black Hand and their occupying force. The new island Rico finds himself on may be full of plenty of things to wreck with your new toy, but this vulnerability provides a challenge that only makes the experience more enjoyable overall.\n\n\n\nWhere Mech Land Assault begins to stumble is reminiscent of where Sky Fortress also ran into problems: a clear lack of content being offered. While you do get the benefit of being able to take your mech tank back into the main portion of Just Cause 3 , one new vehicle and a small additional island are meager offerings in a for-pay DLC pack. All told, Mech Land Assault does add a dozen or so new outposts to be liberated, but with only two story missions and two gear challenges, you can one-hundred percent this add-on in two and a half hours maximum. There?s also then the fact that the few cut scenes presented for the story missions are, once again, just art stills accompanied by voiceover.\n\n\n\nJust Cause 3: Mech Land Assault is a fun little add-on for Avalanche Studios? latest sandbox adventure, but considering the overall lack of content and its relatively steep price point, you might need to be really desperate to get back into Just Cause 3 if you?re using this as your excuse. Still, what is here is enjoyable, and much better balanced than what we saw in Sky Fortress , showing Avalanche Studios is at least moving in the right direction with this post-launch content?and giving me hope for the final chapter in the three-part DLC season pass.\n\n\n\nDeveloper: Avalanche Studios ?

As the franchise progressed, however, it became more complex, and seemingly got away from being just another fantasy farm simulator. Now that the series is on its fourth mainstay installment, and its sixth title overall, the formula has been refined to the point that XSEED’s latest chapter feels like the most polished and complete version of the game yet. Though, it’s not without its fair share of setbacks.\n\n\n\nWhile the narrative has never exactly been front and center in Rune Factory, 4 ‘s tale is nevertheless highlighted to a greater degree, giving players a plot with more depth and character development than seen in any of the previous games. RF4 places folks in the role of an amnesiac protagonist who arrives in the town of Selphia by total happenstance. While aboard an airship, our fair hero — whose gender is determined by the player — gets into a tussle with a pair of hijackers and is ultimately tossed overboard. The fall doesn’t kill our hero, but all the same leaves them without their memory amidst a strange town with which they are unfamiliar. It’s then that they are taken under the tutelage of a dragon mistress who mistakes them for a prince or princess and introduces him to the townspeople as such. Bearing this new royal title means that the hero must assume the responsibilities of a liege, which serves as the perfect segue into the game’s mechanics and all of its features. While Rune Factory 4 ‘s story is hardly going to win an award for being the most compelling or creative, it’s still interesting to the point of providing even more reason to pick up the game each day. If nothing else, its characters possess an admirable amount of individuality, granting folks the chance to interact with a variety of cast members ranging from played-out stereotypes to uniquely charming personalities.\n\n\n\nBut even with the added emphasis on storytelling, Rune Factory 4 is still very much so about actual gameplay. Historically, that has meant farming and dungeon-delving. While those two aspects are delivered in spades and with much polish, they are flanked by a myriad of features that create an experience ripe with countless possibilities and activities. There’s just a ton of stuff to do in this latest entry. Folks can take requests from Selphia’s denizens in order to earn points that they can then spend on improving the town and bringing in more money. Then there’s the ability to schedule and partake in festivals, some of which are exclusive to the different seasons, and of course there are plenty of NPCs with which to interact and earn their trust.\n\n\n\nOf course, like in games of yore, building relationships is a significant part of the Rune Factory experience. Here in 4 , we are shown a system that is both new and old. Old in that building rapport with townies ultimately helps players acquire new equipment, crops and the like — and of course players can still befriend and subsequently marry the guy or gal that catches their eye. This is also where a new feature comes into play: it is now possible to establish long-term relationships with love interests prior to marriage. This system is a minor improvement, but a welcome one regardless. Being able to engage in serious relationships, without the parameters of marriage, feels liberating in that it lets folks explore love interests with depth, but without feeling the need to pull the trigger on proposing to a specific person in order to get to know them on a closer level. It’s not a game-changing mechanic, but its inclusion shows that developers Neverland Co. were willing to add another layer to the dating scene.\n\n\n\nLike in the previous titles, playing the dating game is a big deal here. Fortunately, there’s a great deal of ladies (or guys) from which to decide. There are also rivals, which makes winning a particular person’s heart all the more challenging. As always, this aspect of Rune Factory 4 is wonderfully realized and one of the parts that we consistently looked forward to when starting up each of our play sessions. The fundamentals of this system haven’t changed much, minus the long-term relationships facet, but it didn’t need to, as the process that’s been in place has been rock solid all along.\n\n\n\nSo dating and marriage is only part of Rune Factory 4 . The other two portions are its biggest components. Firstly, the farming. While the original RF possessed a large helping of this feature, with each successive installment the farming aspects of the series have seemingly taken a bit more of a backseat. While it’s still an integral piece of the Factory pie, it’s influence has waned some, no doubt. Still, the farming is fun as all get out, especially for those who really enjoy Harvest Moon and other similar titles. So, as in the past, tilling, sewing and watering crops has to happen on a daily basis in order to grow a decent harvest to then sell and make profits. The raising and selling of crops is as fulfilling as it was in RF3 , but players should clearly understand that this is a game that only dabbles in such simulation efforts, and does not in fact focus all of its efforts on it.\n\n\n\nWhere Rune Factory 4 does narrow its focus is in the direction of dungeon-crawling and monster-taming. As aforementioned, players can take on requests from the townsfolk at any point in their adventure. Some of these requests will be village- or farming-based, while others include finding or hunting items within the confines of the game’s labyrinths. Combat as a whole hasn’t been changed much since the last game. Sure, there’s more options available, but they’re not exorbitant or outstandingly noticeable. First and foremost, players will start off possessing only four basic attacks for each weapon. As they increase their battle proficiency (i.e. use a particular weapon often enough), they earn new attacks such as charge attacks, dash attacks and extended combos. It’s good to keep in mind that combat in Rune Factory is all real-time action, so there’s no waiting or turn-based mechanics to be found.\n\n\n\nWeapon specializations also exist in a number of areas, and it’s up to each person to decide if and how they want to mix and match weapon skills with different armaments. By doing this, there’s a particular amount of tactical prowess that one must understand to get the most out of each combat scenario. In other words, combat situations can be extremely fast and frenetic, particularly so when evaluating the type and number of enemies players may face. Some battles are extra challenging, while many can be handled by even the most inept action-RPG’er; but what can be agreed upon by both sides of the skill fence is the level of intensity involved with boss battles. These situations are tough, but never to a fault — in fact, they manage to strike a balance that enables players to feel rewarded and satisfied upon completion, but never at the sacrifice of becoming maddeningly difficult. The best part about boss encounters now is the ability to befriend these characters, so that players can later call on them in times of need.\n\n\n\nBut bosses aren’t the only monsters to tame; many (read: most) wandering monsters can be tamed and as a result used by the player for a variety of tasks. Tamed creatures can perform all sorts of behavior, but the most notable is that of helping with farm upkeep. It’s a system that allows folks to better spend their time on the many tasks that Rune Factory wants players to pay attention to. Essentially, these monsters become reliable partners and are a gratifying part of hacking and slashing through a dungeon’s caverns and hallways. Outside of taming the previously said bosses, this monster-handling feature hasn’t been altered in the slightest, really; so returning players will know exactly what to expect here in 4 .\n\n\n\nThen there’s the crafting to speak of. Each weapon (and there are many of them, mind you), armor piece and accessory has its own recipe and level. Stronger weapons clearly require rarer materials and a higher crafting level to produce, with each weapon coming complete with unique passive skills, as well. Players can improve a certain piece of gear ten times in total with various materials, all of which can supplement the equipment in question with increased statistics and other passive abilities. This is yet another process that brings variety and depth to the RF table.\n\n\n\nAs an action-RPG, so much comes down to control, though. Fortunately for Rune Factory 4 , the game controls wonderfully. While it can be cumbersome to sort through menus to equip a new item or piece of gear, when the action ramps up, being able to move about and swing a bludgeoning item to and fro feels precise. The 3DSs bottom screen is fantastically setup as well, making use of a layout that is logical, uncluttered and generally effective in its purpose and aesthetic design.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of aesthetic fidelity, Rune Factory may be one of the only games that, after four primary entries in its franchise, looks nigh identical to the original title. That’s somewhat an exaggeration, and yet Rune Factory 4 is not the best looking game on the 3DS. In actuality, it’s nothing more than average. Its use of vibrant colors is excellent, giving the whole thing a whimsical feel, in addition to the its absolutely stunning fully-animated cutscenes. But regrettably, the majority of the game unfolds through the in-game engine, which looks pixelated at times, and jaggy at others. Surprisingly, we played with the 3D turned all the way up for our entire play, just to take care of the aliasing issues.\n\n\n\nWhile on the topic of presentation, Rune Factory 4 sports a soundtrack that fits its fanciful tone. Since much of the game is light-hearted in nature, the music carries out its role with proficiency, full of bouncy tunes that make roaming around Selphia a delight. It knows when to push a hard line, though, as the boss battles are made all the more heart-pounding by percussive jams that feature fast, wailing guitar licks, suitable for anyone that wants a quick adrenaline rush. But for as good as some of its songs are, 4 ‘s soundtrack is overall fairly forgettable. It’s not that the arrangements are poor, rather they feel uninspired and on occasion phoned-in.\n\n\n\nWhat’s perhaps more positive is the game’s localization, which has been handled here by JRPG vets, XSEED. The prose are well-written, clever in their approach to characters and resonate where they need to deliver something more serious. In this, the game is a pleasure to read, which is a requirement when its entirety consists of text. XSEED have also done a fantastic job at making each of the characters feel unique, with certain tonal quirks permeating their personalities.\n\n\n\nClosing Comments :\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 doesn’t do enough to distinguish itself from its predecessors, but the combat depth and amount of things to do around town and on the farm will keep players busy for a long, long while. It’s still an action-RPG with sim elements and feels more like Rune Factory 3.5 than a full-fledged sequel, but the old adage of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” rings true here. If you haven’t been a fan of Rune Factory in the past, 4 isn’t going to do much to change your mind. Thankfully, the localization is top-notch and the gameplay remains as enjoyable as ever, making the game easily worth its price of admission for returning veterans and RPG enthusiasts alike. It may not be the best 3DS roleplaying experience, but it’s a darn fine one all the same. Platform: 3DS\n\n\n\n© 2018 Hardcore Gamer LLC.

Brothers or sisters, either genetic or adopted; they come in every variety. And yet despite the vast differences in cultures or countries there is one constant that’s found in every single family: we love to torment each other! It’s fun. My brother is a long time Rune Factory fan, so naturally I waved my review copy under his nose with a roaring rendition of “Nana-nana-na-na”. The running I do each morning is starting to pay off.\n\n\n\nFor those who are uninitiated, Rune Factory is a clever amalgamation of two very different, but very well put together, types of games. Primarily, it’s a top-down perspective action RPG with sprawling amounts of weapons, armor, accessories, maic, items and all the other bells and whistles you’d expect to see. But, there’s a clever twist in the form of a farm! That’s absolutely right. Make sure you tend to your crops before you go out Orc slaying! The farming is hugely integrated into your income, and I daresay it’s required. There are other means of obtaining precious gold, but your crops will rake in the most.\n\n\n\nObviously, for a game like this to work, the farming and fighting have to go hand in hand, and in Rune Factory it does. Growing and selling crops will earn you money for superior gear and medicine, while completing quests and crushing wildlife will earn you a reputation with the town’s folk, allowing your quaint little village of Selphia to flourish. One of the more interesting mechanics in game is the “Prince Points” system. Doing deeds for the villagers will earn you points that have various and different uses, including expanding your farm to include stables, bigger shipping boxes, or increased inventory space. You can also use the points to book festivals or upgrade shops around town to include a bolstered stock of goods. Choose wisely, because you can only earn so many points per day. It’s kind of addicting too to be prepared to do more of this then you aniticipated.\n\n\n\nCombat is relatively simple and is easily mastered. It utilizes a hotkey system that allows you to assign spells to either “X” or “Y”, in addition to using your standard attack button. This is incredibly valuable as navigating the inventory during combat is clunky, and quite frankly a bit of a chore. It appears however that this was taken into consideration by the developers, because the game automatically pauses the moment you bring up the menu screen, saving you from an unfortunate and grisly fate.\n\n\n\nLike any good RPG, Rune Factory 4 rewards you for your deeds, and quite handsomely at that. There is an immediate sense of accomplishment as each individual task you are capable of performing, such as swordplay, harvesting, cooking, using magic, and even sleeping, has its own separate progression bar, and notifies you when you’ve made an improvement. That being said, Rune Factory 4’s biggest downfall comes in the form of its writing, which is simple, almost insultingly so at times. The story suffers from this most of all, which begins with what could almost be considered one of the deadly sins of gaming: Amnesia. Right from the get go your character gets a swift bonk to the head and can’t remember who he (or she) is anymore. I’ve seen this in games too many times now. It’s safe, it’s easy, and it’s a copout. A zero effort blank slate if you will.\n\n\n\nThe art matches the game to a tee. Absurdly oversized weapons and colorful characters really are the calling card of the Japanese RPG, and it oozes from the game in spades. A dragon with feathers? Check. An adorable sheep-rabbit? Check! A sword the size of your body? Check, check, check. The world itself is presented in the form of a series of colorfully painted 2D images, with everything else laid over top. It looks good…most of the time. I found that the 3D effect would pop further forward than the HUD, which was jarring and very hard to look at. As a result, I spent most of my time playing with the 3D off. The atmosphere wasn’t lost on me though, as the music did a good job of filling the void. I do admit though that the voices felt very stereotypical, which in this case wasn’t a bad thing, just predictable. The sound quality was incredible though! I’ll try not to gush, but I was impressed by what was probably some of the clearest voice acting that I have heard on the 3DS to date.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is another solid entry in an already strongly established series, and it isn’t showing any sign of stopping. It’s got the charm and outward appeal, as well as simple but fulfilling gameplay to draw in new comers, but it’s also got the depth and versatility that keeps veterans coming back time and time again. What it lacks in the form of a gripping story, it makes up for with rewarding, fun, and simple gameplay that can be enjoyed by everyone.\n\n\n\nThe Good\n\n\n\n79\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n\n\nDeveloper: Neverland Co.\n\n\n\nPublisher: XSEED Games\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\nASUS Orion PRO Gaming Headset Review – Need a New Headset?

You could build a house, and by extension, an entire town. You could dig for fossils, grow fruit, visit an island, catch bugs and even visit friends\' towns and take a look around. But there was no brass ring, no storyline or ultimate goal, and it ended up feeling a lot like real life; you do a bunch of chores only to wake up and do them all again the next day. Rune Factory 4 is what I wanted Animal Crossing to be. You\'ll do a lot of the same things; farm, build a town, make nice with the villagers, etc., but there is also a story, combat and even a fun monster capture/collection mechanic to dive into. These aspects add enough spice to the decent Harvest Moon farming sim formula to make the game one that I can feel good about recommending.\n\n\n\nSince having an actual story is what sold me on Rune Factory 4, we\'ll start there. I didn\'t say it was a great story, but its presence is enough to keep the player pushing forward. You play as either a male or female hero with amnesia (yup - sigh) that is dropped into a town from a flying airship. You are welcomed by the town\'s inhabitants and even given reign to act as the town\'s mayor... for some reason. The town is home to a large dragon that gives you advice and encouragement, as well as a number of different personalities, shops and attractions. Just outside the town gates are dungeons and enemies galore, with tougher enemies and areas opening up as you follow the story. By the end of the main storyline (between 20-30 hours, depending on how quickly you race through), the town is better for your presence and you\'ve recovered your memory - just like you\'d expect. The plot really only serves as a framework to push you through the game, but that is more than enough when compared to other, storyless sim games.\n\n\n\nIf you\'ve played a Harvest Moon game before, and I\'d bet most of you have, you already know about half of what Rune Factory 4 has to offer. You till fields, grow crops, food and flowers, chop wood, mine minerals, build structures and generally build your farm and town into a powerhouse. You can cook, craft, even get married and become a parent, life\'s ups and downs are all present and accounted for. All these activities have a fun, semi-addictive bent to them, and playing the game for five minutes or five hours at a time are both equally feasible choices. Once your farm is up and producing new things on a daily basis, crafting, shipping goods and cooking become a brand new addiction, piling right on top of the old one. The Harvest Moon farming formula works and has fans around the globe, and Rune Factory 4 doesn\'t attempt to fix what isn\'t broken.\n\n\n\nThe other half of the equation was what kept me coming back to the game. The dungeons and combat make Rune Factory 4 so much more than just another sim. Players can equip and learn tons of different weapons and pound their way through enemy lairs in search of the next boss encounter. These segments play like so many action RPGs, with a single button attack and special moves mapped to various other buttons and button combos. Leveling up is fast and easy, making repeated runs though enemy filled areas just as rewarding as learning to grow or cook a new vegetable or meal. The boss encounters liven things up, but are largely forgettable; after finishing the main story I\'m hard pressed to remember what the first few bosses even looked like. The game\'s story drives players to new dungeon every few hours or so, and fans of both farming and fighting won\'t get worn out if they prefer on activity to another. My only real complaint with the combat is that enemies respawn CONSTANTLY. If you leave a screen after finishing of its inhabitants, walking to the next screen and immediately back completely refills all the enemies you just cleared out. It\'s annoying, but it also works as a way for players to level up a little faster by exploiting the system.\n\n\n\nAside from enemy respawns, my other beef with the game is the presentation. Rune Factory 4 is a DS game, plain and simple. Everything screams ""last gen,"" from the character sprites to the music to the interface. The game looks pretty rough by today\'s standards, and the 3D effects don\'t do much to make it look any better. Maybe by Rune Factory 5 the developer will have caught up with the 3DS hardware.\n\n\n\nLike I said before, Rune Factory 4 scratches both the sim and action RPG itch in me, and it does both pretty well. By merging the genres, it makes sure no one is left behind, and the gameplay in both aspects is addicting, if not all that original. Enemy respawns are annoying and the game looks and sounds like one released five years ago, but even with those beefs Rune Factory 4 is well worth a 3DS owner\'s time. Especially if you struggled to find a point to in Animal Crossing, as I did.\n\n\n\nFinal Rating\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nA genre blend that\'s enjoyable enough in spite of its dated look.\n\n\n\nRSS Feed Widget\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view\n\n\n\ncomments.\n\n\n\nRSS Feed Widget\n\n\n\nRecent Comments\n\n\n\nAbout Us ·\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions ·\n\n\n\nPrivacy ·\n\n\n\nFeedback ·\n\n\n\nContacts ·\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nGoogle+\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nDiscord\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nMetacritic\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nGame Rankings\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\nPlayer.me\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2001 - 2018, Soltar Enterprises, All Rights Reserved', 'doctype html\n\n\n\nVostok Inc Review: In Space, No-One Can See You Click – GameSpew\n\n\n\nLists\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nPreviews\n\n\n\nTips & Tricks\n\n\n\nGeekSpew\n\n\n\nFilm Reviews\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nSunday, 16th September 2018\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\n\nGameSpew\n\n\n\nLists\n\n\n\nThe Best Single-Player Only Games on PlayStation 4\n\n\n\nThe 12 Funniest Games of All Time\n\n\n\nThe Best Xbox One Games for Kids\n\n\n\n10 Best Uncharted Moments\n\n\n\nThe Five Best Naughty Dog Games\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nSuper Lucky’s Tale is Now Available on Steam\n\n\n\nTry Out Warface on Xbox One This Weekend\n\n\n\nAssassin’s Creed 3 is Being Remastered\n\n\n\nCheck Out This Life is Strange 2 Documentary Ahead of the…\n\n\n\nThe First Gameplay Trailer for WWE 2K19 is Here\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nDonut County Review\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider Review (PS4)\n\n\n\nHaunted Dungeons: Hyakki Castle Review\n\n\n\nZone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner MARS Review\n\n\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man Review\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nThis Week, We ‘Ave Mostly Been Playing… #12\n\n\n\nVideo Games Aren’t Realistic, So Stop Expecting Them to Be\n\n\n\nHow Comfortable are Gaming Chairs for Players?\n\n\n\nAssetto Corsa Competizione Makes a Good First Impression\n\n\n\nSuper Street’s Physics Are Out of This World (In a Bad…\n\n\n\nPreviews\n\n\n\nGetting Hands-On With Jump Force Left Me Feeling Like an Anime…\n\n\n\nUpcoming Mable & The Wood is a Sweet Metroidvania With a…\n\n\n\nPreview: Valkyria Chronicles 4 Takes The Series Back To Its Roots\n\n\n\nBattlefield V’s Open Beta Makes a Good Impression\n\n\n\n11-11: Memories Retold Paints World War I Like Poetry in Motion\n\n\n\nTips & Tricks\n\n\n\nWhere To Find The Dungeon Entrances in World of Warcraft: Battle…\n\n\n\nHow to Assign Staff to Specific Rooms in Two Point Hospital\n\n\n\nHow to Earn Money in Shadow of the Tomb Raider\n\n\n\nHow to Use Photo Mode in Shadow of the Tomb Raider\n\n\n\nHow to Change Difficulty in Shadow of the Tomb Raider\n\n\n\nGeekSpew\n\n\n\nAll Film Reviews\n\n\n\nLearn the Lore With the Game of Thrones Podcast w/Preston Jacobs\n\n\n\nTitan Comics’ The Road to the Thirteenth Doctor #3 Gives Us…\n\n\n\nSearching (2018) Review\n\n\n\nForget the Stigma: The Star Wars Prequel Films Are Awesome\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nVostok Inc Review: In Space, No-One Can See You Click\n\n\n\nBy\n\n\n\nChris Mc\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n5 August 2017\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nGoogle+\n\n\n\nReddIt\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\nShooter-cum-cookie-clicker Vostok Inc invites you to take a business-class journey around the cosmos, but spends half the time kicking the back of your seat.\n\n\n\nVostok Inc , like Alien and Aliens before it, depicts a future where big business, not government, is at the forefront of space exploration. This tongue-in-cheek game casts you as the CEO of the titular corporation, setting out to inflict your eighties-themed avarice upon the galaxy. Aided by your incessantly annoying, suspender-wearing sidekick Jimmy, you blast and build your way through several star systems, ignoring the protests of the local populace. Raising enough capital will allow you to take on the boss, at which point your rampage continues till you’ve conquered six star systems in all. Unfortunately, what should be a joyous blend of combat, conquest and colonization veers off-course.\n\n\n\nThere’s no denying that Vostok Inc looks a treat; it sports an eighties-era colour palette which, coupled with an electronic soundtrack, makes you want to go out and buy a ridiculously oversized mobile phone. And the twin-stick controls are suitably responsive, giving you ample opportunity to avert your course before you plow idiotically into an asteroid or enemy. There are a range of foes to fight, though it’s mildly disappointing that enemies in subsequent areas tend to be reskinned versions of foes from other levels. The game’s bosses, thankfully, are more varied and provide a worthy challenge, so much so that defeating them is a real achievement.\n\n\n\nAside from combating the regular enemies that assault you as you roam around each system’s scrolling play area, you’ll periodically have to deal with scouts that appear on screen. Dispatch them quickly and there’s no issue, but let them escape and you’ll be locked into a frenetic single-screen battle with a range of foes; this is a particularly neat feature that serves to keep you on your toes. Though, irritatingly, the game still subjects you to this even if your main craft has been destroyed and you’re roaming around in your escape pod, which has a mere ten armour points. But on the whole, Vostok Inc has many of the elements of an enjoyable shoot-em-up.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that it’s mired in mediocrity by an uninspiring building system that’s more Cookie Clicker than Command and Conquer . NonGunz , which we also reviewed , had a similar feature but didn’t force it upon you. Vostok Inc , on the other hand, refuses to let you confront each level’s boss until you’ve gathered enough “Moolah”, the game’s currency. Your primary means of accumulating moolah is landing on planets and constructing buildings, which is just a matter of clicking on the building of your choice. The building will then start to generate moolah which you then use to construct bigger buildings; these in turn give you more moolah.\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it. There’s no real element of strategy as to which building you construct; while each construction’s respective descriptions pointedly underline its potential for exploiting people it doesn’t matter whether you construct a school or a waste plant. You simply build the most expensive one you can afford because that will give you the highest income rate. With no customer discontent to deal with it’s simply a matter of sitting back and letting the money roll in. Literally, since I found the best way to make progress was to leave the game running while I did something else.\n\n\n\nPerhaps this is meant to be a commentary on the sometimes dull nature of big business, but it doesn’t make for an enjoyable game. Nor does the game’s humour alleviate the tedium. Aside the satirical descriptions of the buildings, you’re subjected to a stream of dad jokes and quotes from Jimmy who can’t be turned off, though this will apparently be addressed in a future patch.\n\n\n\nVostok Inc ‘s manager system offers an interesting blend of risk and reward. You can rescue floating managers who often turn out to be executives or middle managers, either of whom will boost your income rate. The former need to be kept amused through a virtual pet style system which, while appealing at first, requires you to spend so much time farming asteroids for rewards that you’ll likely end up ignoring their incessant demands. Middle managers, on the other hand, don’t need rewarding, but should your ship be destroyed they’ll be lost in space. I went out of my way to collect middle managers only to lose one fifty in one fell swoop. True, it was my own fault and at least I got an achievement out of it.\n\n\n\nThe game does have high points, when you’re given a glimpse of what might have been if the game’s idle clicker system hadn’t been inflicted upon you. I found that I could combine specific weapons to produce a different effect, and, moments later, I was gleefully zooming around the solar system, annihilating my foes with a lightning gun. Likewise, managing to pick up a manager before they expired in the cold vacuum of space offered a brief thrill. But each time I remembered that I had to make another X trillion moolah before I could test my arsenal out on the end of level boss, my mind went back to the grind, and my joy quickly dissipated.\n\n\n\nStripped of the need to generate moolah, or injected with a heavier dose of strategy, Vostok Inc could be a stellar venture. But the bottom line is that this game’s pockets of excellence are stifled by an awkward mechanic that turns your interstellar journey into an unappealing, pan-galactic grind.\n\n\n\nVostok Inc is available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Xbox One. We reviewed the Xbox One version.\n\n\n\nPrevious article\n\n\n\nPurchase Tacoma on GOG and Get a Free Game\n\n\n\nNext article\n\n\n\nTotally True Gaming News Round Up: James Pond Returns, New Splatoon 2 Team and More\n\n\n\nChris Mc\n\n\n\nRELATED ARTICLES MORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n\n\nAscending Madness is a Masochistic Gamer’s Fever Dream\n\n\n\nThis Is The Police 2 Review: Bigger, Bolder and Better\n\n\n\nEmbrace Your Rebellious Side in Stealth/Strategy Game Vandals\n\n\n\nReview: Fox n Forests is a Wonderful Throwback to 16-Bit Platformers\n\n\n\nMotoGP 18 Review: Déjà Vu\n\n\n\nDie for Valhalla!

Medium: Cartridge/Digital Players: 1 Online: No ESRB: E10\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 marks the first entry for the series on the 3DS, and while this might not be a huge overhaul for the series, it certainly stands out as a unique RPG on Nintendo’s handheld. It’s also been a couple years since Rune Factory 3 hit the original DS, and I’d imagine that fans are more than ready to hop back into the unique blend of roleplaying action, farming, and romancing that the series is well known for.\n\n\n\nAt the onset of Rune Factory 4 you’re given the option of choosing the gender of the lead character, which can lead to some slight plot changes and most noticeably impacts relationship options. Like the Rune Factory titles before it, your character ends up losing his or her memory, after falling from an airship and landing smack dab in the middle of your hub town. You’re quickly mistaken for royalty, scheduled to arrive around the same time, and despite having that particular confusion cleared up quickly, you’re left in charge of the town’s affairs and tasked with a number of goals.\n\n\n\nOne nice addition for this entry is the Request Box, located just outside of your room. This box will give you various tasks to complete daily, starting off with one task a day and slowly expanding the number of requests you can complete as you advance through the game. This serves as an extended, mostly optional tutorial for new players, which will get you accustomed to everything Rune Factory 4 has to offer. While there’s an overall plot to unravel, and a lot of dungeon exploring, hack and slash monster killing to engage in, the more mundane tasks will become equally important. The Request Box breaks down these various activities, like farming, crafting, and cooking, and does a great job of explaining why these activities are useful.\n\n\n\nAnd while not an addition to the series, fans will note that relationships and the continued growth of those bonds play a pretty important role with Rune Factory 4. Like previous entries, you can bestow gifts and other items upon various characters in town that will build your overall affinity levels with an NPC. And again like previous entries, you can marry various characters. But there’s a slow build to that proposal point that feels like a nice touch this time around, and allows you to really feel out the personality of a potential mates before jumping in. There’s also a number of NPC’s you can interact with, including some that are gained after exploring dungeons and defeating bosses.\n\n\n\nCombat feels pretty similar to previous entries too, and hasn’t seen much in the way of any significant change. Everything is still action focused, with a number of weapon types and armor at your disposal as you explore. You’ll have a pretty open map that gradually reveals itself, with different areas cordoned off until certain story events have been hit. You’ll have the option of shortcuts via Save Points and Airship travel, which will cut down on the need to speed through low-level areas that bear little benefit the further into Rune Factory 4 that you get.\n\n\n\nMonsters, while providing the major source of experience for leveling up when defeated, can also again be befriended in Rune Factory 4 as well. You can take your friendly monsters and put them to work your farm, and even harvest material directly from them, like fur to be used in crafting. The sheer number of day to day activities you can engage in by the midway point of the story is pretty staggering, and while you’ll struggle to fill a day with things to do early on, that will become less of an issue after a handful of hours have passed.\n\n\n\nOne thing that really stood out to me with Rune Factory 4 is how great the game looks at 60 frames per second. This isn’t what I’d label a graphical showcase, but we rarely see 60fps titles on the 3DS and it really stood out to me here. On the downside of things, the 3D effect in Rune Factory 4 isn’t good. Most games are content to push menu items to the foreground, along with speech bubbles to show depth, but Rune Factory 4 manages to screw even that small effect up more often than not. It’s one of the few 3DS titles that clearly has no idea how to use the 3D function well, and you’ll be better served by having the slider turned all the way down with this one.\n\n\n\nBut from a content perspective, Rune Factory 4 can’t be beat. It’s lightweight, upbeat story is just engaging enough to keep you moving along, and the day to day activities are addictive enough that you’ll keep coming back. The combat isn’t particularly deep, and won’t stand out as a major strength, but there are a surprising number of dungeons and zones to explore, along with bosses to fight. The biggest offence outside of the poor 3D use comes from some awful menu designs, which makes weapon and tool switching tiresome, but all in all that’s a fairly minor complaint. I definitely think Rune Factory 4 is worth a look, whether you’re a fan of the series or not, as it offers up a pretty unique experience on the 3DS.\n\n\n\nGrade:\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nSee larger image\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 – Nintendo 3DS (Video Game)\n\n\n\nManufacturer:\n\n\n\nXseed\n\n\n\nESRB Rating:\n\n\n\nEveryone 10+\n\n\n\nPlatform:\n\n\n\nNintendo 3DS\n\n\n\nGenre:\n\n\n\nrole-playing-game-genre\n\n\n\nNew From:\n\n\n\n$29.99 USD\n\n\n\nIn Stock\n\n\n\nTags: 3ds , neverland co , rune factory 4 , xseed games\n\n\n\nRecent Reviews\n\n\n\nNBA 2K19 review for Xbox One, PS4, Switch\n\n\n\nNo more paying for haircuts! ...\n\n\n\nMushroom Wars 2 review for Nintendo Switch\n\n\n\nQuantity over quality. ...\n\n\n\nYakuza Kiwami 2 review for PS4\n\n\n\nOne of the best Yakuza releases gets the Kiwami treatment, making for an even better experience on P ...\n\n\n\nMarvel\'s Spider-Man review for PS4\n\n\n\nSony is going to web a lot of consoles and copies of Spidey this holiday season. ...\n\n\n\nRecent News\n\n\n\nUbisoft unearths Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey post-launch content details, media\n\n\n\nSeptember 13th, 2018\n\n\n\nNintendo eShop Update -

Then imagine my surprise when I find a much deeper and rewarding experience than Nintendo's own Animal Crossing: New Leaf that was released just a few months prior. I'll admit after giving up the Harvest Moon series nearly a decade ago, Rune Factory 4 might be the game that pulls me back in to the series, provided I can get past some of these ridiculously cliché characters and tropes.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 starts with your main character aboard an airship, bound for an unknown destination, with a parcel in hand that some ne'er do wells want to get their hands on. A short tussle doesn't quite go your way and now you're an amnesiac (of course), and you're falling from the sky. Thankfully the town of Selphia and their dragon guardian Ventuswill are there to break your fall. Apparently you were expected, though not in this fashion, as Ventuswill has you pegged for the prince (or princess should you choose) that was meant to arrive. How odd though that a prince/princess would be prime material for working the fields of Selphia, but at least everyone seems to be helpful in the town and receptive to your new responsibilities. But there's something a little more sinister at play here, and by following the at times drip-fed storyline, you'll wind up being something a little more important than the groundskeeper of Selphia.\n\n\n\nSo what does being a farmer in Rune Factory 4 entail? Quite a lot actually. There are a number of roads you can take after the initial introduction to the game, and at times it feels like there is almost too much stuff to do in any given day. First you've got to tend to the crops, and then maybe go make some food with said crops, or do you go sell them to buy seeds for more plants? And then you've got to make sure you're keeping up with the people in town (who are presented in the most generically animated cut-scenes I've ever seen) and make sure you're giving them gifts so that they stay happy. Some of these people in town feel like such cookie-cutter anime characters that it's almost insulting. You've got the brave knight who secretly loves sweet things and is afraid of ghosts, the cheerful bath house attendant with her older sister, but the most jarring member of the town is Porcoline, the town chef who is a fairly effeminate male but grossly overweight, combined with the performance of his voice actor, he stands out as the sole exception to the rest of the town's banality.\n\n\n\nThen there are the requests from the townspeople that you've got to fulfill, but not before you go searching for materials so you can build yourself a forge, or maybe a monster barn, or perhaps some cutlery for cooking? Is it someone's birthday? Or is there an event going on in town, like the fishing challenge or the cook-off? There is pretty much always something happening within the town of Selphia that can eat an entire day in game time (1 game hour to 1 minute passing in real time). Then there's the actual storyline to follow, which is where the game takes a noticeable turn for the difficult.\n\n\n\nSo when you decide to not be totally tied down to the farmer lifestyle, you can go out and explore the areas around Selphia which is full of monsters that will have no problem mowing you down early on. The leveling up system in Rune Factory 4 doesn't adhere to the norms of 'Get XP, stuff happens.' Instead it's similar to that of Final Fantasy 2, where the more you perform an action, the stronger it gets. The same rule applies to gaining hit points, get hit, get points, and rune points which are used to perform actions like cooking, weapon skills, or magic. It pays to play so to speak, but at times it can feel a little overly 'grind-y' making for dull patches of gameplay where you're just running around taking damage or plowing through enemies and fields. The biggest problem here is having little indication to tell you where you should be physically before entering certain areas. And this in turn can lead to quick deaths which also means taking a good chunk of your cash to cover the medical bills when you pass out. Yes just like in real life the threat of crippling medical debt is always looming over your head in Rune Factory 4, so save early and save often, which has me wondering, why is there no easy way to get back to the main menu to load my data? You have to restart the game completely to get to a data loading screen, which is a minor annoyance.\n\n\n\nCombat isn't much to write home about, just your typical top-down classic Zelda inspired action-adventure fare, with all attacks mapped to the B button and combos that are performed by hitting the button until things die, and spells mapped to X and Y respectively. There is a dash which is on the R button and is quite useful for getting out of some messy situations, and can be combined with normal attacks once a weapon has been leveled up enough. Hit boxes can be a little weird against some of the bosses, causing them to hit you when it doesn't look like they are, and the same can be said for attacks, which don't always seem to have the range you think they do. It's not enough to be totally detrimental to the game, but it does happen from time to time.\n\n\n\nFrom a visual standpoint this game isn't looking too hot either. The 3D models are alright, but the world surrounding them looks a bit drab, with lower resolution sprites making up a majority of the locales you'll be visiting. The game is certainly bright and colorful, but for some reason it is visually jarring to see 3D characters running around on a 2D plane, and everything just looks flat. And the 3D effects aren't all that impressive either, relegated to small weather effects, it's almost hard to tell whether or not I have the 3D slider turned on. In terms of audio, the game is mostly forgettable in this regard, and I don't know if it was just me, but I was tuned out of the music to the point that I had to turn up the volume just to confirm whether or not there was music in the game. The voice acting features a lot of repeated lines, which thankfully aren't grating on the ears. While Rune Factory 4 does have a lot of stuff to do, it also falls in to that Animal Crossing grind where I'd check in for a little bit, run a few errands and then put it down for a while. I felt that there was no sense of urgency to get the story done, but once things got rolling I was definitely pulled in, even if on more than one occasion I was stymied by enemies that were way more powerful than me. Thankfully there's a lot more post-game content too, like attempting to marry one of the townspeople. If there is one thing this game isn't short on, it's things to do.\n\n\n\nLike I said before, at first I wasn't totally on board with Rune Factory 4, but after spending more time with it than Pokemon X lately I've warmed up to it quite a bit. It's not the prettiest game out there, but it has some solid gameplay mechanics and the amount of things to do is never in short supply. In fact, sorry citizens of Odessa, you're going to have to start picking your own weeds. The town of Selphia needs me, and they've got a lot more stuff going on than visiting islands to catch bugs.\n\n\n\nNever short on content, Rune Factory 4 is full of things to do that'll keep players engrossed for a long while.\n\n\n\nRating: 7.4 Above Average\n\n\n\n* The product in this article was sent to us by the developer/company.\n\n\n\nAbout Author\n\n\n\nIn a past life I worked with Interplay, EA, Harmonix, Konami, and a number of other developers.

Marvelous AQL had stated that technical difficulties, probably due to the bankruptcy of the game’s creators, Neverland, Co., had caused issues with having access to the game’s code, so it seemed that Europe would yet again not receive a translated game on its shores. Luckily, Xseed looked for another partner to localize the game for PAL countries, so that they could release it as a download only title, albeit over a year later than the initial North American release. The fun farming/RPG hybrid is here at last, and the game is once again ready to sap all your free time.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 begins with the player, male or female, on an airship about to deliver an unknown item to somebody. It’s only a few seconds before a bunch of soldiers pop out of barrels to skyjack the ride. These dudes know the player is an Amazon same day delivery man carrying a precious item, so the soldiers give you a smack on the back of the head, rendering yourself unconscious for a while and inducing a favourite illness of the genre, amnesia. Not knowing who you are, you forget what you are carrying and who for, leading to the soldiers accidentally kicking you off the airship, leaving you to fall to your doom, thankfully, the fall is broken by the Native Dragon of Wind, Ventuswill, allowing you to recover, but still lacking any memories but your name. Mistaken as royalty, the player takes the role of a prince or princess and must help Ventuswill with running the town of Selphia, cultivating a farm and adventuring the lands outside of this little thriving community.\n\n\n\nThere are clearly two acts that make up the complete story of Rune Factory 4 , supplying a lot of content. In fact, it’s said that this instalment has the biggest story of any Rune Factory game. The first act is based on going into the dungeons and fighting the bosses to find out that there is something strange happening with them after they are defeated. This leads on to a journey to collect the Rune Spheres. Act two involves a person representing the Sect Empire and is threatening the village, leading onto a plot that involves fighting an enemy outside of your local map. For your reward, a bonus third section opens up that acts as post game content with ridiculous hard bosses that will give you the smack down unless you have the best gear in the game. While there is this entire story to do, it’s rather thin and forgettable overall – a simple plot designed to get you moving. What makes the journey enjoyable is doing the activities themselves and interacting with the villagers, all whom stand out with their unique personalities and charming art.\n\n\n\nSelphia is littered with plenty of activities to do, reminding me of the similar scale and addictive nature of Animal Crossing , except with the inclusion of RPG elements and friendlier villagers – people in Rune Factory 4 won’t guilt trip you or be angry at you for not playing after leaving the game for a few weeks. Introduced early is the back garden of the castle grounds, which relates to turning a weed infested patch of land into a flourishing field of scrumptious crops. Growing food becomes the main source of income, as fully developed harvests can be picked and thrown into the shipping box for cash, which means spending money on future food investments and gear to help you fight the nasties outside the village.\n\n\n\nOnce you have mastered the art of hoeing, planting, watering and harvesting, your selection of seeds will increase, opening options for your grown crops to be used in cooking recipes, creating medicine and crafting items, but while that is an important cycle of the game, there are other jobs to do as well. I ended up assigning a time slot to deal with my farm, normally first thing in the morning when the character wakes up at 6am. But the great thing about Rune Factory 4 is that you never really feel under the pressure of time, so you can casual go about your farming and adventuring freely.\n\n\n\nWandering into the wilderness means meeting a lot of enemies that need to be killed. Combat is simple, and focuses on quick action, with the player able to equip a variety of weapons, such as swords, axes, staffs and fighting gloves, while armour can be worn to protect oneself. The more the player uses a specific weapon, the more skill the character gains with it. Hitting certain levels will unlock additional attacks, such as being able to dash attack or charge up an attack to let go for a more powerful hit.\n\n\n\nBattling is done in real-time, but lacks true depth, this is a combat system that anyone can learn, and for a game like this, it makes sense that the combat isn’t a thorn in the player’s side that stops them enjoying the game. Even though each weapon category has its own set of attacks, what I found is that fighting can become monotonous from time to time, as enemies can either be hacked to death furiously by tapping one button or require a magic element to take advantage of their weakness, such as the turtles having high defence, but are feeble to fire attacks, but again this is just a player tapping one button to spam a wave of fireballs. The real challenge is the boss fights, which require timing and the ability to dodge incoming attacks to stay alive, but also keeps the combat interesting after all the fighting with the minions leading up to the boss. If you happen to be defeated, you’ll be stung with a doctor’s fee for patching you back to normal.\n\n\n\nThe addition of a friendly companion means you can enter the fray with one computer buddy. This helps keep the enemies off you, and surprisingly, the AI is good at helping in battle. It made a few of the boss fights easier when my knight friend Forte would gain the boss’ attention by running up and giving it a good few pokes with her sword, but this doesn’t help with the actual combat itself. It would be more interesting if the dungeon level design was better, because fast combat doesn’t have to be monotonous if it has some depth behind it. The Ys series is a good example of this, a game that blends in fast action, magic, defence and solid level design to make encounters stimulate the brain, but as I mentioned earlier, this is no doubt done to keep the game simple for people who aren’t generally into action RPGs.\n\n\n\nSelphia is filled with small activities to take up if you’re not feeling in the mood to nurture the farm or go on an adventure. Once you have experienced the introductory quests given from the talking quest box outside the castle, you can jump into fishing to catch sea life to use for cooking (another spare time job to do) or selling, capture monsters to grow a ranch on the farm, using them to produce eggs, honey, milk or sell their fur, or do some forging, chemistry or crafting. The last option is doing requests that villagers have sent to the castle, acting as small quests that range from the simplest of chores, like cutting wood, to growing a special flower that is actually a dungeon. Yeah, I was just as baffled when I first came across it.\n\n\n\nLastly, dating and marriage has been a thing in Harvest Moon for some time, but Rune Factory 4 is the first time this series has given players the ability to build their friendly relationships into something more. Firstly, you’ll want to become friends with everyone, as this offers benefits, such as gaining new seeds and gear, but you can keep chatting with them to get to know them better, offer gifts that are tailored to their likes and then if you’ve managed to build up a good relationship with the character, ask them for marriage and become man and wife, maybe even have a kid if you agree to it. For me, my time in Selphia meant that I was a dude who was taking his wife, a person who was once a friend helping me in the boss fights, on couple adventures.\n\n\n\nWith all the tasks and jobs to do, there will be times where excitement will dwindle – not all the events are as good as participating in as others, and while you don’t have to max all the job roles out, some requirements, such as unlocking secret town events, require you to have met conditions that will mean taking part in these various activities to level up your skills to be able to access the higher level items that come from being a quality chef or blacksmith. This is the same for combat as well, grinding enemies that respawn on the map to level up each skill area. It’s one of the reasons why Rune Factory 4 makes a great bite size play for a train trip or a 30 minute session before bed, because it stops the boredom from creeping in that I sometimes felt from five plus hour sessions I would do occasionally.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 is a game with some issues that thankfully don’t stop it from being enjoyable. The combat is on the shallow end, I would have liked more exciting dungeon designs, and it doesn’t come across as a title that is designed to pace well, but with so much to do within the game, and not being forced to progress against a time clock, Rune Factory 4 becomes an addictive title that has options, even if some of them aren’t exciting as others. This is a solid upgrade for fans, while offering people who enjoy something similar, maybe through the latest Animal Crossing game, to come to Rune Factory 4 with the same mindset of a pick up and play experience, but be met with rewards for all their hard work.\n\n\n\nShare this post\n\n\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nClick to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\n\n\nGiveaway - Warface: Collector's Early Access Pack Worth £61.99\n\n\n\nFull details ›\n\n\n\nVersion tested:\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nDeveloper:\n\n\n\nNeverland Co.\n\n\n\nPublisher:\n\n\n\nXseed Games\n\n\n\nGenre:\n\n\n\nSimulation, Role-Playing Game\n\n\n\nStaying up to date\n\n\n\nReceive email updates\n\n\n\nYouTube channel 99k subscribers\n\n\n\nFollow on twitter\n\n\n\nRSS Feed\n\n\n\nLike our Facebook page\n\n\n\nWrite news for DarkZero\n\n\n\nWe're looking for a new face to join our team of volunteers.

For those unaware, the series is a spin-off of the popular life simulation Harvest Moon, splicing many of the laidback themes of farming with the adventure of fighting enemies in dungeons. The latest title is a solid addition to the series and a good starting point for newcomers alike. The life simulation / adventure series is still quite unique, but was the wait worth it?\n\n\n\nThe series is quite hard to characterise for those that have yet to experience it. The life simulation reminiscent of its Harvest Moon origins is definitely present, but it\'s been blended into an adventure game featuring a real-time battle system. The two concepts actually work quite well together, creating a cohesive experience that\'s arguably more realistic and immersive than either one individually. Things done in the town will affect what happens when fighting monsters in dungeons, and vice versa. For example, rescuing someone from a dungeon will lead to ramifications in the interactions with other characters in the town.\n\n\n\nFarming is another great example. Many plants must be grown, with each type having a specific benefit. Whilst many of the benefits are typically standard for an adventure game (for example, healing characters), there is something charming about having to grow the plants, rather than just purchasing them. The demonstrable effects and benefits of the interactions of the two areas increase as the game progresses.\n\n\n\nThe variety also means that there\'s always something to do, and players can generally choose what they want to focus on at any point. In addition to farming and fighting, players can also fall in love or use their power as a prince/princess to improve things. Finding a partner in the town is a cute addition. NPCs all feature different personalities, and freedom is given over whom in the town to try to charm. Using monarchical power is somewhat misleading though, as often it leads to nothing more than doing odd jobs to improve the town. Influence and allies in battle are won by being friendly and helpful, not wielding absolute power. There\'s nothing wrong with that of course; the game may feature monsters to stab, but it\'s still loving and peaceful at its core. Other oddball things to do include levelling up skills in things as bizarre as sleeping, bathing and walking. Regardless of how pointless it sounds, it still raises a smile when the jingle plays to indicate a skill has increased.\n\n\n\nTime progression plays an important role in events (certain things will only happen on certain days), but the game allows players to sleep when they feel they have completed their objectives for the day. The fact that there is always a choice in when to ditch life simulation and get knee deep into some action is appreciated.\n\n\n\nThe real-time battles are good fun, too, and their depth develops as the game progresses. Their general short nature prevents them from ever being dull, and there\'s significant variety in the types of weapons that can be used, with each one having its own strengths and limitations. Timing also plays its part, as characters can dodge attacks and wait for openings. The system feels similar to a 2D The Legend of Zelda adventure, except with a greater variety of viable weapons (and spells). The fact that a huge amount of items can be taken on adventures is another positive, whilst even more can be stored in the town. This means all kinds of weapons can be purchased and plants acquired/purchased/grown without fear of running out of space.\n\n\n\nAs with many games today, one of the first choices is whether the main character is male or female. Unfortunately, the way this is presented leaves a bad taste. The player\'s character is flying in an airship and the game then makes an assumption about the preferred gender based upon how enthusiastic the response is to being so high up. To be fair, the game is quite gender neutral overall: there\'s the possibility of a female lead, and the female characters are all reasonably proportioned and wearing a socially acceptable amount of clothing. Given the gender equality issues in so many videogames, most will be willing to forgive this small oversight.\n\n\n\nA source of annoyance that is less forgivable, though, is the amount of mandatory text to read. Optional conversations are plentiful and usually short and enjoyable, but conversations that are required for the storyline tend to drag on to the benefit of no one. The story itself is somewhat intriguing enough to follow, which is as good as can be expected.\n\n\n\nThe town features many characters, and each one is introduced with a short anime style cut-scene the first time they are met. The animations are beautiful, but they serve no purpose other than to see what the characters look like in detail. Each one only lasts an average of three seconds or so, making the whole thing rather pointless.\n\n\n\nThe same goes for voice acting. Whilst reading through a few sentences of speech between two characters, one will occasionally say (as in vocally as opposed to through text) something like ""yes"" or ""right."" It occupies a strange middle ground, providing no real benefit. Players still have to read the conversation through, and there\'s so little vocalised that it also doesn\'t help to make the characters more relatable or realistic.\n\n\n\nIt feels as though Rune Factory 4 is dipping its toes into cut-scenes and voice acting when really it should just be diving in. The results indicate that there\'s plenty of potential, but they are both used for too short a period to have any real impact. In summary, it\'s a wasted opportunity and a borderline cause of frustration. Luckily there are so many positives to make up for it.\n\n\n\nCubed3 Rating\n\n\n\n7 /10\n\n\n\nVery Good - Bronze Award\n\n\n\nFinancial problems for developers Neverland Co. may mean that Rune Factory 4 is the last in the series, and its release in Europe at all is surprising given the circumstances. The game itself is a good addition to the series. Niggles with presentation and the amount of mandatory text to read are present, but there are so many positives to take from the engaging and varied experience. The game comes recommended for anyone curious about what an action title crossed with a life simulator can deliver.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 (Nintendo 3DS)\n\n\n\nRate Game 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n\n\n\nGame Details\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\nScreens\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nDeveloper\n\n\n\nNeverland\n\n\n\nPublisher\n\n\n\nXSEED Games\n\n\n\nGenre\n\n\n\nReal Time RPG\n\n\n\nPlayers\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nC3 Score\n\n\n\n7 /10\n\n\n\nReader Score\n\n\n\n10 /10 (1 Votes)\n\n\n\nNone Out now Out now None\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nThere are no replies to this review yet.

A farming RPG? How would that ever work, I wondered. Would you be getting into random battles with local wildlife? Would you cast spells to make your crops grow?\n\n\n\nYou have to understand that, back then, one couldn?t imagine a game like Harvest Moon, because its ideas simply hadn?t been tried yet. When the game was finally released in English on our shores, the experience wasn?t quite what I’d imagined at its announcement.\n\n\n\nThe funny thing is, years later, a series would be released by Harvest Moon parent company Marvelous Entertainment that actually hit close to my initial expectations of what a ?farming RPG? would be: Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon.\n\n\n\nI?d never found the time to really give the Rune Factory series a proper chance, so I came into the franchise?s sixth chapter? Rune Factory 4 for the 3DS?with a handful of expectations but absolutely no experience.\n\n\n\nSome of those expectations were met. Rune Factory 4 is, indeed, a game where you raise crops and kill monsters?sometimes, strangely, at the exact same time. The game opens with your character accidentally falling out of the sky, resulting in a rather rough landing in the small village you?ll soon call home. (During the landing, you get knocked on your head, leading to a bout of amnesia. Ah, Japan?will you ever tire of that trope?) The village?s caretaker is a legendary dragon, and she’s certain that you are a prince (or princess) come to bring good fortune to all who live there.\n\n\n\nWhile you?re rather uncertain of your newfound royalty, you decide that you might as well earn your keep by helping make the village a better place. For those familiar with the long line of Harvest Moon games, this means activities like growing and selling crops, tending to livestock, and socializing with your new friends and neighbors. The other side to Rune Factory 4 is combat and monster-slaying, something that definitely makes the game a bit more familiar and easier to understand for those who have no experience with Harvest Moon . Initially, venturing outside of the protection of the village?s walls will come from simple curiosity, but as the game plays out, quests and storyline progression will push you to explore new areas and vanquish menacing beasts.\n\n\n\nMy opinions on Rune Factory 4 were a bit mixed at first, and then it dawned on me as to why: My brain had been tricked into expecting a level of pacing that it shouldn?t have. I?ve played enough Harvest Moon at this point that I?m accustomed to (and appreciative of) its slower, more laid-back way of doing things, but that gets muddied the moment action is thrown in. Where’s the next area I need to explore? What’s the next big monster for me to kill? Why aren?t I being given those things at a faster rate?\n\n\n\nWhen you find the ability to get past thrusting action-adventure expectations upon it, Rune Factory 4 can really be entertaining. A game where your main character is tasked with both creating life and causing death seems like an idea that could easily feel disjointed, but it works. The player is given a nice amount of flexibility in what needs to be done and when, so you can always decide that you?d rather focus your energy on interacting with others and helping build up the village, or you can put responsibility aside for a bit and just have fun adventuring in the wilderness.\n\n\n\nOf course, Rune Factory 4 is at its best when you roll up your sleeves and balance everything the game has to offer simultaneously. As I?ve never played any of the previous Rune Factory games, I didn?t have any reference with which to determine how much better (or potentially worse) the elements offered up here were in comparison to previous chapters?but as my introduction to the series, it hooked my pretty early. The NPC villagers you?ll encounter have some charming personalities to them, so long as you?re willing to put forth the effort to get to know them better. Aspects like farming, cooking, and crafting flesh out nicely as you unlock more options and abilities, and even the element I was most concerned about?combat?was more fun than I’d assumed it would be. This really is a farming game and an action game brought together, a combination that could easily go wrong had it been in less-capable hands.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, it also could be in more capable hands. As surprised as I was with Rune Factory 4 , and as much as I enjoyed a decent chunk of the time I spent with it, sometimes that enjoyment came in spite of the game?s execution. Both aspects of the game?its social side and its more traditional game side?could definitely be better, and if they were, this could be a heck of a franchise. Conversing with villagers (or eavesdropping on them while they converse with one another) is fun, but I was left wishing that the whole social aspect had more depth to it. Meanwhile, Rune Factory 4 ?s action elements feel like a supplement to a farming game, where I wish they were strong enough to stand on their own.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 reminds me a lot of Persona 3 and 4 , titles that also marry two very different schools of gameplay into one total package. Atlus? recent Persona efforts work as well as they do because they offer halves that are strong enough to survive on their own?even when they?re meant to always be a couple joined in cohabitational bliss. I never felt as if Rune Factory 4 ?s farming or fraternizing was ever as strong as what I?ve received from Harvest Moon , nor was its quite on the level of any host of action-adventures offered up on the 3DS or otherwise.\n\n\n\nThat doesn?t mean Rune Factory 4 is a bad game?I want to be clear on that. It’s a good game that could be great; i’ts a B-average student who could study harder and get many of their grades up to As. Rune Factory 4 only failed in my eyes in two ways, and those were its graphics and user interface. The UI is easily the biggest negative checkmark; in a game so focused around working with a wide variety of both tools and weapons, throwing them all into a few cumbersome item containers with no real way to quick-select your most-used instruments means you?ll be spending far more time moving through menus than you should have to. Meanwhile, the game?s visuals are too unimpressive too much of the time. Backgrounds feel as if they were initially meant for a lower-resolution platform and then upscaled, and there?s a level of stylistic inconsistency that runs through everything from characters to items to monsters.\n\n\n\nThose two aspects of the game are failures?but failures in what’s otherwise a pretty solid experience. I couldn?t help but come to adore the plucky little Rune Factory 4 and its quirky I?m-about-farming-crops-but-also-farming-loot nature, but I also can?t help but think it could, and should, be more. This was my first shot at the series, and I?m glad I finally got the chance to give it a try. My concern about coming back for more, however, is that I?d want to see some marked improvements in gameplay depth and presentation. Given that we?re six chapters into the franchise, I?m worried if those expectations would be realistic.\n\n\n\nDeveloper: Neverland ? Publisher: XSEED Games ? ESRB: E10+ ?

Rather than having fun, you can easily feel stressed out by accomplishing tasks within tightly set parameters, or you\'re missing content due to unenjoyable-but-necessary choices, or you just get bogged down in granular minutiae that yields no tangible result. But every once in a while a special game will come along and make these types of shortcomings feel worth it. Enter Rune Factory 4.\n\n\n\nIt isn\'t a very complicated game--at least, at first it isn\'t. After choosing between a male and female avatar (the latter of which is offered for the first time in the series), you\'ll find yourself rummaging around a mysterious town, where you\'re mistaken as royalty. Honestly? That\'s about as far as the story goes, if you can even call it a story, because like other simulation games you\'re going to get most of your satisfaction out of forging your own tale.\n\n\n\nIf you can think of it, you can most likely do it in the fourth iteration of Rune Factory. Farming, cooking, gathering, dungeon-crawling, relationship-building, and wanderlusting are all fair game, and nearly all of your activities (such as crafting, farming, dungeon crawling, and even walking or taking a bath) have their own deep and rewarding levels of progression. While the visuals are decidedly dated in the sense that it looks like a first generation DS game, the design here has an undeniable amount of charm.\n\n\n\n""...the design here has an undeniable amount of charm.""\n\n\n\nJust like past Rune Factory games, the cast is as quirky and colorful as ever, partially thanks to a solid localization from XSEED. You’ll find yourself falling in love with people like Margaret, an eligible bachelorette that’s terrified of heights, or the gullible butler-in-training Vishnal. Pretty much every member of the town is likeable in their own way. As with the narrative, you won\'t find anything that blows away typical genre conventions, but Rune Factory 4 makes up for it with a vibrant canvas of personality and an interesting set of dialog to boot. Long term relationships and marriage are also an option, and although they don\'t feel as organic as they could\'ve been, they\'re fun distractions.\n\n\n\nWhile the town-centric happenings are pretty eventful, dungeon-crawling sometimes devolves into nothing more than a chore. The crux of the issue is Rune Factory 4\'s dungeon design, which largely follows the trite go-here-pull-this-lever structure. Boss fights tend to follow the same conventions throughout the game instead of providing a consistent challenge. Most of them feel like a grind, which is a shame considering there\'s a bigger focus on combat in Rune Factory 4 than in previous games.\n\n\n\n""...dungeon-crawling sometimes devolves into nothing more than a chore.""\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4\'s biggest problem, though, is its hand-holding. For what feels like hours on end, the game has to teach you about every little thing before you\'re allowed to actually experience it. If you’re someone who plays a lot of RPGs and know the basics inside and out, you\'re still going to have to go through a tutorial for some 10 hours, performing menial tasks until the game trusts you to take over. On the flipside though, that means this is the perfect entry for newcomers.\n\n\n\nShould you decide to power through the initial tedium, the game really opens up and never lets go. Once everything is available, there\'s almost no end to what you can accomplish, or what you can choose to do. If you decide on scavenging for equipment, you\'ll often find that your dungeon runs will produce more useful spoils than most other games. If cooking and fishing are your thing, you\'ll constantly find new recipes and fishing holes to keep things feeling fresh. Further, resources called Prince/Princess Points allow you to customize the game to your liking, whether that be creating new events in town, expanding your cooking abilities, or upgrading your character\'s offensive or gathering abilities.\n\n\n\n""Should you decide to power through the initial tedium, the game really opens up and never lets go.""\n\n\n\nRegardless of your input, your town will improve over time, and more events and buildings will unlock, prodding you to keep taking care of your townsfolk. Although dungeons can be a bore, resources abound within them--and, of course, monsters to tame. In Rune Factory 4, monsters can be used as farm hands and can create items, which adds a new level of usefulness outside of combat. The can perform tasks that you may not have much fun doing yourself, freeing you up to do the things you actually want to.\n\n\n\nWith deeper combat and a shorter tutorial, Rune Factory 4 could\'ve been an exceptional game. But if you\'re willing to slog through until it opens up, you\'ll find an enjoyable offering packed with some fun simulations and an elaborate crafting system. Sure, it plays things safe, but there\'s a surprising amount of fun to be had crafting items, taming monsters, and building relationships in between sometimes-bland dungeon runs.\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\n\nGenre\n\n\n\nRole Playing\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4 adds new romance options, the ability to select a male or female character at the games start, and endless crafting, farming and cooking opportunities. The player becomes Selphias prince or princess and can manage the village, explore the countryside with townsfolk, or tame monsters in the wild to aid them in battle or help out in the fields.\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nUS censor rating\n\n\n\nEveryone 10+\n\n\n\nRelease date\n\n\n\n1 October 2013 (US), (UK)\n\n\n\nSee comments\n\n\n\nWe recommend\n\n\n\nBy Zergnet\n\n\n\nLoad Comments\n\n\n\nRecommended\n\n\n\n8 things to watch out for this week\n\n\n\nAbout Us - Who\'s on the GamesRadar+ team?\n\n\n\nGame Reviews\n\n\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n\n\nTV Reviews\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nShadow of the Tomb Raider review: ""Jump scares, human sacrifice, and a Lara that has straight up lost her sh*t""\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNoblechairs Hero gaming chair review: \'A solid chair for gaming AND office work\'\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nTurtle Beach Stealth 300 headset review: \'Great range of features for a reasonable price\'\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man review: “About as good as superhero gaming gets”\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nTwo Point Hospital review: ""A mini-universe of glee and medical mischief""\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nMandy review: ""A bloody, druggy, superbly crafted revenge thriller""\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nA Simple Favor review: ""A slick thriller that’s best enjoyed with a martini in hand""\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nFirst Man review: ""Gosling and especially Foy are out of this world""\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nA Star is Born review: ""Superb.

I\'ve plumbed TV worlds, I\'ve led campaigns against the forces of darkness, I\'ve hunted monsters, and now I\'ve tended bovine. Rune Factory 4 is a special blend of Harvest Moon and active-battle dungeon crawling, but players may need to brace themselves for more exposition than they want.\n\n\n\nFans and series novices will have to learn all the basics and start from scratch with an amnesiac Prince or Princess as their avatar. There\'s a ton of dialogue and a long road to anything resembling a conclusion, but a commute or plane trip will fade away as the gameplay hours tally up. Rune Factory 4 will soak up more time than it actually takes to run a farm and slaughter monsters, but the franchise seems determined to remain insular and averse to risk.\n\n\n\nThis sounds really weird considering Rune Factory \'s history. It was born of a desperate need to radically evolve Harvest Moon , but after five different games across PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, this one seems a little stubborn. Players can tend to animals, crops, and fight through the story, but more often than not the game will follow in lockstep instructing them through the motions. I\'d forgive anyone who can\'t stay entertained by the plot, which only exacerbates the time for a sweet grind.\n\n\n\nWhere other games do a better job layering plot with an excessive tutorial section, Rune Factory 4 just lays it on thick. The light voice-acting and cheery music keep things on the humorous side, but any given character might annoy the bejeezus out of players. Earning points to unlock festivals and expansions, upgrading abilities, and upgrading the town are all still motivating, but it\'ll take a while before players see a lot of variety in any one area.\n\n\n\nAllowing dedicated, knowledgeable players a larger variety of unlocks would work better and keep tutorial hours more interesting. Again, if the plot wears thin early, the writing will quickly wear on your nerves and hours will feel like days. As someone more a visitor than a Princely Mayor to the Rune Factory franchise, it felt like I had fallen out of the joke. Eventually more of the town opens and the social elements help you form a stronger bond with your character.\n\n\n\nSome characters speak with each other, while others will require you to complete side objectives, both without too much repetition. Certainly, Rune Factory 4 is the distracted Japanophile to Animal Crossing \'s more abstract and by-the-numbers life simulation. Dungeons don\'t really help, as they feel like a complete sideshow to the steady growth of your town, but that also means they\'re only as fun as mashing buttons can be. Boss battles might feel like they take too long as enemies transform and feature lots of health, but it does end up feeling like conquering a mountain.\n\n\n\nThe franchise\'s matchmaking elements return and let players get down to business with all kinds of folk. Before anyone asks if the player can take someone to the barn house, Rune Factory 4 is rated E10+ which means players of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy the game so long as they like animé-styled art and big talking dragons.\n\n\n\nFor the next game in the series, I hope Rune Factory can strive to radically reinvent itself, because this entry\'s biggest weakness is that it can feel too refined and set in its ways. In keeping the door open for newcomers, it loses sight of breaking new ground.\n\n\n\nCode provided by publisher.

Instead, the franchise has a dedicated following of gamers who love the engaging blend of dungeon crawling and simulation elements. At this point, hardcore fans know exactly how they want to play and what to expect – it’s a shame that Rune Factory 4 forgets that and acts more like a tutorial for hours on end.\n\n\n\nRune Factory 4’s overbearing hand-holding is the biggest issue this entry faces. As a longtime fan, I already had my strategy in mind, but instead of diving in, I was in tutorial mode for many hours. The basics are delivered through the sidequests, showing how to befriend animals, farm, and fight. As a seasoned player, I was completing quests well before the game even thought I’d dive into the content. I ventured outside the city walls quickly and I bought products before quests required me to. This is an annoyance to veteran players, as you’re always several steps ahead of the game without the freedom to do your own thing. On the other side of the coin, this entry is by far the most newcomer-friendly, though even some newbies might find themselves growing tired of the nonstop guidance. Even at the 10-hour mark, the game still doesn’t trust you on your own, still offering mundane quests.\n\n\n\nAs the prince or princess (with amnesia) of the town, you bring more villagers in by sprucing up the place. You earn points to unlock extra festivals and expand your facilities, but they are scant – especially early on. The other problem is that these points are your sole currency for upgrading your abilities and your town. This forces players to choose between the main objective (making the town bigger) and the more enjoyable character progression. If you love cooking, you need to devote points to better cooking licenses, but you also pay a hidden cost of not being able to use your precious few points on better festivals to draw in more townspeople. This feels like a bottleneck to keep players from progressing quickly, holding them back from the activities that they enjoy most.\n\n\n\nThe trademark quirky townsfolk are still the game’s stars. One of my favorites was the brother/sister dynamic between the playful bookworm Kiel and his super-serious knight sister, Forte. The characters aren’t as animated as, say, Rune Factory 3’s family that spoke in opposites, but interesting personalities make their way in. For the record, having a giant dragon as your bantering guide during the adventure adds something special.\n\n\n\nOne positive thing this time around is how group conversations emerge if you engage certain characters while they’re hanging out with others. These scenes are especially funny; one has some of the younger men contemplating, “What is love?” Another refinement is having special character missions pop up, where you might follow a character to a special place or find a clue for them. The important part is that they always lead to a new scene and fresh dialogue, keeping things from getting too mundane.\n\n\n\nDungeons are bland, focused solely on fighting and gathering. Like previous games, you locate levers and open up previously inaccessible areas with mind-numbing predictability. Boss battles also follow suit; enemies have large health bars and usually several forms to grind down. Instead of keeping me engaged, bosses feel like unnecessary time sinks. To add insult to injury, the combat is still clunky, and the moves you unlock can end up costing you matches; the margin for error is thin, making it easy to take a hit and get stuck in a combo.\n\n\n\nAlthough Rune Factory 4 is not as refined as I would like, it still has an engagement level that’s hard to ignore. Settling into a routine while balancing farming, monster recruiting, dungeon crawling, gathering, and socializing provides you with something to always do – and plan for. Much of the fun I had was discovering new areas, like coming across a fresh fishing spot, or finally earning the requirements to unlock new meals to cook. The vast area Rune Factory 4 provides gives you plenty of these little moments that can completely change up your strategy. For instance, as you explore, you might find fields where it’s always summer to grow certain crops.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, what you find when revisiting fields is often unpredictable. As I was scavenging, I found everything from better swords to new fruits to better crafting items. This is also the game’s biggest strength – all the parts complement each other well. Recruiting monsters becomes more thrilling because monsters can also lend you a hand on the farm and some even produce items such as eggs and fur for profit, cooking, or crafting. Even when I roamed dungeons, they weren’t just about fighting and advancing the story; I found tons of resources and rare rocks to mine. The satisfaction comes in discovering a new item and realizing you can cook a new dish or craft new armor with it. This is the most engaging part of the experience; I lost myself maximizing my success each day.\n\n\n\nAt times, I couldn’t put Rune Factory 4 down, at others I found myself disappointed, wanting more than small tweaks. The lackluster dungeons and bosses and the hoops veterans have to going through for many hours isn’t fun. The series has had plenty time to advance beyond what Rune Factory 4 provides. Still, the formula is still entertaining and I found myself enjoying my daily chats with locals and finding ways to increase my profits. I even appreciated the small enhancements, which are steps in the right directions. Unfortunately, the areas that need the most improvement – like dungeons and the core battle system – are relatively untouched.\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\nOn\n\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nGame Informer's Review System\n\n\n\nConcept\n\n\n\nFarm, recruit monsters, and dungeon crawl to help a town thrive\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\n\nThe graphics don’t hold a candle to most 3DS games, but the characters have their own style\n\n\n\nSound\n\n\n\nRune Factory has a history of annoying tunes, and this entry doesn’t change that\n\n\n\nPlayability\n\n\n\nThe constant hand-holding early on is annoying.

With an old-school sense of adventure and mystery, it could almost be a great platformer ... if only it wasn\'t so frustratingly unfriendly to players.\n\n\n\nSee on the Xbox Store\n\n\n\nSome kind of story\n\n\n\nElliot Quest stars a little guy named Quest, I mean, Elliot . When the game begins, we know precious little about him and his quest. His brief, cryptic narration states that no matter how many times he dies, he always comes back. He must find a Guardian and end the Satar\'s curse.\n\n\n\nThat\'s the whole explanation players get early on, and it isn\'t enough. As you progress through the game, Elliot will sometimes have more cryptic thoughts that basically mean nothing. The developer seems to be going for a Braid-like effect with the hero\'s random musings, but they\'re usually more annoying than intriguing.\n\n\n\nPlay for long enough, though, and you\'ll experience enough cinematics to piece together the narrative. Elliot has been cursed by a demon. Unable to die, he will slowly become a demon himself unless he finds a cure. Meanwhile, his wife has gone missing. Could these problems be connected?\n\n\n\nIf you can put up with some vagaries, it\'s an interesting enough premise. But the basic information is doled out way too late compared to pretty much every other game ever. The store description tells you more about the story than the first few hours of gameplay!\n\n\n\nAnother example of Elliot Quest\'s love mystery working against its best interests is the control options. From the main menu, players can select from four control types: A, B, C, and D. But the game doesn\'t explain what the buttons do or what the difference between control types are. So you\'re essentially making a blind, random choice of control types before you even start playing. What the heck?\n\n\n\nI\'m on a quest!\n\n\n\nElliot Quest is patterned after the general structure of Zelda II, in that players travel across a world map to reach a series of levels. Some levels or portions of them will be inaccessible to Elliot until he acquires upgrades, so you can\'t just go everywhere right away. With the interconnected structure of Metroidvania having become the standard for platforming adventures nowadays, it\'s cool to find this one built so differently.\n\n\n\nStill, the actual map could be a lot better. There are no predefined pathways, so you can go any which way until you reach a level or obstacle. But the map doesn\'t allow diagonal movement, creating a clunky feel at odds with the lack of pathways. Also, levels are not visibly marked on the map. You have to look around until an exclamation point appears over Eliot\'s head, indicating an area he can visit. The idea is to encourage exploration. But in practice, the lack of markers just results in more unwieldiness.\n\n\n\nThe core platforming gameplay fares a bit better. Elliot can only run, jump, and shoot arrows initially. The arrows have a limited range and downward trajectory. Our hero starts with only three hearts, but he\'ll pick up more by defeating certain bosses.\n\n\n\nDefeating enemies grants Elliot experience. You wouldn\'t know that at first, because the only indicator of XP gain is a meter hidden away at the bottom of the skills page. It\'s so tucked away, I first learned of the leveling system after killing enough enemies to level up. Meanwhile, a chain meter is always displayed at the bottom of the screen. When filled, this meter apparently results in enemies dropping items more frequently. So the game displays something that you absolutely don\'t need to see (the chain) while hiding an actual useful stat like XP. Argh.\n\n\n\nLeveling up has its benefits though, because you get a point to allocate to one of five skills. Strength makes your shots fly farther and eventually unlocks a Mega Man-style charge shot; wisdom increases MP gain; agility improves firing rate; vitality increases health gain; and accuracy adds critical hit effects. They\'re all useful skills, so grinding for XP is a good idea.\n\n\n\nElliot loses XP when he dies, which is less good. You\'re bound to fall down pits or take too many hits fairly often (especially with occasionally punishing level designs), so the XP loss really stings. Losing gold wouldn\'t be great either, because it\'s needed to buy items from shops. My vote would be to ditch the death penalty altogether, as it\'s an outdated concept that mixes poorly with certain types of games.\n\n\n\nYou can check the map at any time to track where you\'ve been within a level, but it only displays rooms without showing any details like what they contain or how they connect. Find the actual map item within a level and the rooms you haven\'t reached yet will be filled in. Levels also have small keys to open doors and a big key needed to open the boss door – all Zelda-style touches.\n\n\n\nItems and magic\n\n\n\nElliot will eventually discover items like a shield (that only blocks projectiles while standing still, annoyingly), bombs for destroying walls, a candle that temporarily lights up lanterns in dark caves, wings for double-jumping, and many more items.\n\n\n\nHe also gains five types of magic, starting with wind magic that allows him to move through green blocks (I\'m not sure what they\'re supposed to be), float up in a draft, and suck nearby items towards himself. Using spells depletes the magic meter, which can be refilled by collecting drops from enemies, using a magic potion from the inventory, or by reaching a gravestone (checkpoint).\n\n\n\nThe problem with all of these items and powers is the game never explains how to use them. Elliot Quest has a bizarre aversion to in-game text outside of narration and NPC conversations, particularly tutorial text. You have to try an item to figure out what it does. The game doesn\'t even tell you which button uses magic and items (it\'s ""Y"" on Xbox One).\n\n\n\nYou can also only equip either a spell or magic at one time – not both. Switching between them requires pace-hurting trips to the inventory menu. Recent retro remake Wonder Boy: The Dragon\'s Trap added separate buttons for magic and items, as well as allowing players to switch items with the bumper buttons. Those kind of improvements made Dragon\'s Trap a better game without diluting its old-school feel. Elliot Quest would do well to focus on creating the best player experience over strict adherence to 1980s-era game design.\n\n\n\nAchievements\n\n\n\nThe Xbox One version of Elliot\'s Quest offers 22 Achievements worth a total of 1,000 Gamerscore. Many of these are awarded for defeating certain bosses or finding key items. Achievement hunters will have to find all 10 crystals , a form of collectible that sometimes opens access to new areas.\n\n\n\nElliot Quest also has three different endings. All three have an Achievement, so you\'ll need to play through three times if you want the full Gamerscore. The endings are based on a karma system. Avoid stealing from NPCs or breaking certain objects and you\'ll qualify as good. Steal items, team up with a rogue, and break things to be a bad guy. Mix and match to come in neutral.\n\n\n\nNaturally, the game does not explain the karma system. But you can at least see your current karma rating on the status screen. I recommend using the Elliot Quest FAQ at GameFAQs for guidance on the karma system and just to make it through the game in general, unless you want to be confused at every turn.\n\n\n\nOverall impressions of Elliot Quest for Xbox One\n\n\n\nElliot Quest looks very good for a retro-themed game, simplistic sprites notwithstanding. The backgrounds make strong use of color and have plenty of delightful parallax scrolling. The music by Michael Chait is especially good, although you\'ll have to jack your speakers all the way up to hear it. The Xbox One version\'s audio levels are mixed ridiculously low, but the developer is investigating the issue.\n\n\n\nDespite the quality aesthetics and cool Zelda II-inspired game structure, Elliot Quest is a hard game to recommend. The stubborn refusal to explain anything is just one of many obnoxious design decisions that distance the player from the game. I normally love this style of game, but even I gave up in annoyance after a while. If you like old school games and can stomach deliberately obscure design, maybe you\'ll enjoy this one more than I did.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n\n\nExplore a world map and venture into platforming levels like in Zelda II.\n\n\n\nA fantastic soundtrack evocative of 16-bit classics.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n\nNo explanations or guidance leads to lots of frustration (or the need to look up help online).\n\n\n\nStory is doled out unevenly and veers into pretention at times.\n\n\n\nSlow dialog text can\'t be skipped or advanced, so you have to wait it out.\n\n\n\nLot of little design issues add up to an overall frustrating experience.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nout of 5\n\n\n\nElliot Quest costs $14.99 and is available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Steam.\n\n\n\nSee on the Xbox Store\n\n\n\nXbox One review code provided by the publisher.\n\n\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links.

There’s always that one title that’s nothing more than a shameless cash-in, a horrendously pandering children’s game, or a line-item on some publisher’s budget spreadsheet. Ben 10: Galactic Racing is all of these.\n\n\n\nIt should be plain from the outset, but it’s not. Galactic Racing first presents the player with a rather neat-looking menu, and a handful of options, including single-player, multiplayer, extras, and options.\n\n\n\nAny kart racer is going to take a lot of cues from the grandfather of the genre, Mario Kart , and Ben 10: Galactic Racing does this almost to a fault, but falls short of doing any of them well. Galactic Grand Prix is exactly like the different cups you’d find in any Mario Kart game. Short Circuit lets you choose a few tracks and create your own racing playlist. Single Race is exactly like it sounds, allowing players to choose a track and race around. Time Trial will set players on a track by themselves with a single goal: run a fast lap. Showdown is the equivalent of Mario Kart ‘s battle mode, pitting racers against each other in an arena with items and powerups strewn about.\n\n\n\nThe game’s nine racers are available from the outset, with almost no variation in stats. Master one character and you’ve mastered them all. The same can be said of Galactic Racing ‘s two different go-karts. One is supposed to be light, while the other is supposed to be heavy, but that doesn’t seem to be the case will truthfully no difference in handling between the two.\n\n\n\nI will admit that multiplayer can be slightly chaotic fun, despite a complete lack of balancing. It seemed like the lead racers were getting the powerful items just as frequently as those in the back of the pack. Mario Kart ‘s genius comes from the way items are balanced, although the seemingly random-ness of races can be frustrating.\n\n\n\nBen 10 ‘s biggest fault is that there is no randomness. If you’re in first it’s far too easy to hold on to that position. In that way, multiplayer seems almost a wasteful use of the player’s time. Why bother playing against humans if it’s about as mundane as racing against the computer endlessly?\n\n\n\nThat said, Ben 10: Galactic Racing is a decent use of the license, so fans of the Cartoon Network show will be pleased with what’s on offer here, just don’t waste your time or money if you’ve got no interest in Ben Tennyson and his alien compatriots.\n\n\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Ben 10: Galactic Racing would be graded on a curve. Launch software line-ups are notorious for this kind of shovelware. Unfortunately for the developers and D3 Publishing, that’s just not the case with the PlayStation Vita. Your attention — and money — is much better spent else where.\n\n\n\nPlayStation LifeStyle’s Final Score\n\n\n\n– No balance or variety.\n\n\n\n– Boring as all hell.\n\n\n\n– Spend your money elsewhere on the Vita’s launch.\n\n\n\n–\n\n\n\nSHARE\n\n\n\nTWEET\n\n\n\nDid You Buy a Vita?\n\n\n\nOfficial iOS/Android PlayStation App Gets New Update, Adds Augmented Reality\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nPSLS Originals\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nPS VR\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\nReview Policy\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nGameRevolution\n\n\n\nAdChoices\n\n\n\nPlayStationLifeStyle.net is a property of Mandatory , an Evolve Media , LLC company. ©2018 All Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\nmonitoring_string = ""e648000e5cd42cece065ea6b2f880692""']",2012-02-15,"Gameplay has been cited to be similar to Nintendo's 2008 and 2014 games Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8 , with characters racing through various race circuits based on different places across the Ben 10 franchise, and collecting power-ups (called Omni-Nodes) to boost their speed or hamper their opponents.

energy used by the high elves to become the dominant culture on the planet resulted in a huge ancient war in which dragons , humans , orcs and temple gaurdians joined forces against the high elves but were crushed by them . this war left much of ancaria in ruins and the high elves isolated themselves in the aftermath . now the elves themselves are fighting over who controls the t - energy and to make matters worse the enrgy is spreading out of control , poisoning the land and mutating creatures into monsters . it is into this chaos that your character sets out . do you take the path of the light and avert the coming war or take the path of shadows and push ancaria further into chaos ?', 'one of the most pleasing aspects of the original sacred was the choice of character classes which managed to put an interesting twist onto some well worn fantasy class cliches . sacred 2 continues this trend . on offer are high elf , seraphim , dryad , inquisitor , shadow warrior and temple guardian . take the shadow warrior for example , although he mainly fits the profile of the melee heavy “warrior” class , good for beginners thanks to his heavy armour and powerful weapons . his undead nature means he can summon fallen comrades for help in battle giving him some “necromancer” style abilities as well . most interesting of all is the temple guardian . this is a dog headed cyborg with an arm mounted gun that fires out pure laser like t - energy , adding a sci - fi wrinkle to an otherwise heavily fantasy orientated gameworld .', 'your final choices on the character creation screen are which god you swear allegiance to and the difficulty option you wish to start in . the seraphim cannot chose an evil god nor the inquisitor a good one ( also the seraphim is restricted to the light campaign and the inquisitor to the shadow one ) but the rest are free to choose who you please . the god grants a powerful spell to your character that can be improved by visiting temples and praying . bronze difficulty eases your character into the game slowly with further ones unlocked as you complete the game . there are also lan and online multiplayer modes available , with a special hardcore difficulty available that sees the game ended the first time your character dies .', 'the meat of the game is found in its questing and combat . a symbol over the head of an npc allows you to collect a quest from them . this generally involves killing a certain number of enemies or collecting a certain number of items . killing yields experience , and when enough has been acquired you level up giving you points to spend on your characters development . skills come in the form of combat arts , either as special attacks or magic spells . as you progress in the game you’ll discover runes that allow you to learn new arts or upgrade existing ones . characters can learn a maximum of ten skills , although they have more than that to chose from . runes which can’t be used by your character can handily be exchanged at the runemaster for ones more appropriate to your class . although this system lacks the depth and variety compared with other roleplaying games , it’s not as potentially overwelming making it perfect for those who always wanted to try the genre but have been put off in the past by the reams of stats and skills than can easily bloat games of this type .', 'the main problem with sacred 2 however is the incredibly hefty system requirements needed to run it . there is a whopping twenty gigabyte minimum hard drive install for a start and a decent dual core set up and powerful grapics card are a must if you want it to run smoothly . to be brutally frank it’s hard to see why all that power is necessary . although the game has some very nice dynamic lighting effects , the character models and environments don’t have the same level of detail that the likes of say everquest 2 manage to display on a lesser machine . the voice acting is very variable with some suspect lip synching lending the cut - scenes a slightly scruffy quality .', 'but with that said , sacred 2 : fallen angel still manages to be an entertaining romp . ancaria is an interesting world to explore , with many weird and wonderful creatures to slay along the way . it’s not the most original game you’ll ever play , but it does what it does very well and if you are twiddling your thumbs waiting for diablo 3 to come out , this is a more than acceptable way of spending your time until that happy day .', 'sophie cheshire is a staff writer at thunderbolt , having joined in june 2003 .', 'you should check out our podcast .', 'website designed by philip morton and hosted by webfaction .', '© thunderbolt 2000 -

Kikizo was also a leader in the early HD video content space with over 3000 videos published, including epic documentary-length features in a pre-YouTube era. Above all, Kikizo\'s story was about the freedom to have fun taking risks, resulting in the great, and the not-so great -- but hey, even Shenmue 3 worked out in the end! This page is a final, unified archive of 20 years of Kikizo (also briefly known as Video Games Daily ) and its business history -- and a celebration of some of the best ever years in gaming.\n\n\n\nTeamwork: Just a few of us through the years... from L to R, Team Gamerweb HQ in 2000, Team Kikizo at E3 2005, and in London in 2009\n\n\n\nAttention Whore: Various press cuttings from 1999 to 2011.

Within a year it had become the #1 Sega site and became part of IGN . 2000-2001 - The site was spun into a major venture capital-backed start-up GamerWeb , and became a popular US-focused games network, reaching millions of users with staff in London, San Francisco and Tokyo. 2002-2003 - GamerWeb was acquired by Hi2 and developed into a live TV format on Sky.\n\n\n\n2003\n\n\n\nKikizo begins\n\n\n\nAdam decided to start again from scratch;\n\n\n\nKikizo\n\n\n\nlaunched\n\n\n\non Feb 17 2003 with day-one gold such as chats with\n\n\n\nevery creator at Sega Japan\n\n\n\nand the only interview anywhere online with the legendary\n\n\n\nco-founders of Rare\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nHow did we look?\n\n\n\nTokyo Game Show 2003\n\n\n\nRareware: The Video Interview\n\n\n\nE3 2003: Complete Coverage Index\n\n\n\nInterview: Sega of Japan R&D\n\n\n\nYuji Naka Video Interview\n\n\n\nThe Xbox Interview: J Allard\n\n\n\nKaz Yamauchi Video Interview\n\n\n\nXbox Interview: Michel Cassius\n\n\n\nJason Rubin Video Interview\n\n\n\nShigeru Miyamoto Video Interview\n\n\n\n2004\n\n\n\nA force to be reckoned with\n\n\n\nHitting its stride in 2004, Kikizo took the absolute monkey out of the competition when it secured and published a world-exclusive video interview with\n\n\n\nSatoru Iwata\n\n\n\n, notoriously hard-as-nails to pin down for consumer media.

Its sequel – Sacred 2: Fallen Angel – is an altogether grander affair with a similar mixture of intriguing character classes, many lush and detailed landscapes to wander, a huge variety of monsters to fight and quests to complete, two distinct campaigns to play through, several difficulty levels and various online play modes. There truly is enough in this game to keep even the most hardened of fantasy roleplayers occupied for a very long time indeed.\n\n\n\nThe setting is Ancaria, a world of the brink of war and possessing a bloody history. Controversial ancient magic called T-Energy used by the High Elves to become the dominant culture on the planet resulted in a huge ancient war in which Dragons, Humans, Orcs and Temple Gaurdians joined forces against the High Elves but were crushed by them. This war left much of Ancaria in ruins and the High Elves isolated themselves in the aftermath. Now the Elves themselves are fighting over who controls the T-Energy and to make matters worse the enrgy is spreading out of control, poisoning the land and mutating creatures into monsters. It is into this chaos that your character sets out. Do you take the path of the Light and avert the coming war or take the path of Shadows and push Ancaria further into chaos?\n\n\n\nOne of the most pleasing aspects of the original Sacred was the choice of character classes which managed to put an interesting twist onto some well worn fantasy class cliches. Sacred 2 continues this trend. On offer are High Elf, Seraphim, Dryad, Inquisitor, Shadow Warrior and Temple Guardian. Take the Shadow Warrior for example, although he mainly fits the profile of the melee heavy “Warrior” class, good for beginners thanks to his heavy armour and powerful weapons. His undead nature means he can summon fallen comrades for help in battle giving him some “Necromancer” style abilities as well. Most interesting of all is the Temple Guardian. This is a dog headed cyborg with an arm mounted gun that fires out pure laser like T-Energy, adding a sci-fi wrinkle to an otherwise heavily fantasy orientated gameworld.\n\n\n\nYour final choices on the character creation screen are which God you swear allegiance to and the difficulty option you wish to start in. The Seraphim cannot chose an evil god nor the Inquisitor a good one (also the Seraphim is restricted to the Light campaign and the Inquisitor to the Shadow one) but the rest are free to choose who you please. The god grants a powerful spell to your character that can be improved by visiting Temples and praying. Bronze difficulty eases your character into the game slowly with further ones unlocked as you complete the game. There are also LAN and online multiplayer modes available, with a special hardcore difficulty available that sees the game ended the first time your character dies.\n\n\n\nThe meat of the game is found in its questing and combat. A symbol over the head of an NPC allows you to collect a quest from them. This generally involves killing a certain number of enemies or collecting a certain number of items. Killing yields experience, and when enough has been acquired you level up giving you points to spend on your characters development. Skills come in the form of combat arts, either as special attacks or magic spells. As you progress in the game you’ll discover runes that allow you to learn new arts or upgrade existing ones. Characters can learn a maximum of ten skills, although they have more than that to chose from. Runes which can’t be used by your character can handily be exchanged at the Runemaster for ones more appropriate to your class. Although this system lacks the depth and variety compared with other roleplaying games, it’s not as potentially overwelming making it perfect for those who always wanted to try the genre but have been put off in the past by the reams of stats and skills than can easily bloat games of this type.\n\n\n\nThe main problem with Sacred 2 however is the incredibly hefty system requirements needed to run it. There is a whopping twenty gigabyte minimum hard drive install for a start and a decent dual core set up and powerful grapics card are a must if you want it to run smoothly. To be brutally frank it’s hard to see why all that power is necessary. Although the game has some very nice dynamic lighting effects, the character models and environments don’t have the same level of detail that the likes of say Everquest 2 manage to display on a lesser machine. The voice acting is very variable with some suspect lip synching lending the cut-scenes a slightly scruffy quality.\n\n\n\nBut with that said, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel still manages to be an entertaining romp. Ancaria is an interesting world to explore, with many weird and wonderful creatures to slay along the way. It’s not the most original game you’ll ever play, but it does what it does very well and if you are twiddling your thumbs waiting for Diablo 3 to come out, this is a more than acceptable way of spending your time until that happy day.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nout of\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nSharing is caring\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\nThe author of this fine article\n\n\n\nSophie Cheshire is a Staff Writer at Thunderbolt, having joined in June 2003.\n\n\n\nRecommended reading\n\n\n\nPC, PS4, Wii U, Xbox One Feature\n\n\n\nby Sean Kelley\n\n\n\nThunderbolt’s Most Wanted of 2016\n\n\n\nBatman\n\n\n\nStreet Fighter\n\n\n\nZelda\n\n\n\nPC, PS4, Xbox One Opinion\n\n\n\nby Calvin Kemph\n\n\n\nWhen winter never comes\n\n\n\nGame design\n\n\n\nPC Review\n\n\n\nby Pete Worth\n\n\n\nFallout 4\n\n\n\nFallout\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nPC Opinion\n\n\n\nby Calvin Kemph\n\n\n\nHer Story: The unreliable narrator\n\n\n\nGame design\n\n\n\nPC, PS4, Xbox One Feature\n\n\n\nby Sean Kelley\n\n\n\nFallout 4: What we know, what we want\n\n\n\nFallout\n\n\n\nPC Opinion\n\n\n\nby Calvin Kemph\n\n\n\nInvestigative noir with Blues & Bullets\n\n\n\nGame design\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto\n\n\n\nCall of Duty\n\n\n\nFIFA\n\n\n\nBattlefield\n\n\n\nAssassin's Creed\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nRetail\n\n\n\nGentle persuasion\n\n\n\nYou should check out our podcast .\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\nPreviews\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nForum\n\n\n\nPC\n\n\n\nXbox One\n\n\n\nXbox 360\n\n\n\nPS4\n\n\n\nPS3\n\n\n\nWii U\n\n\n\n3DS\n\n\n\nPS Vita\n\n\n\niPhone\n\n\n\niPad\n\n\n\nWebsite designed by Philip Morton and hosted by WebFaction .\n\n\n\n© Thunderbolt 2000-2018.
