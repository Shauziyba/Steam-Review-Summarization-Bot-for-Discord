 == character progression and classes == 



as in the original game , players are able to improve their characters , referred to as guardians , by gaining experience points ( exp ) — when a set number of experience points are accumulated , the player ' s character will "" level up "" and gain improved statistics which further enhance performance in battle . milestones , including the "" main scenario "" milestones , are specific tasks given to the player by non - player characters ( npcs ) which reward items and exp . completing main scenario milestones progresses the overarching plot of the game .



destiny 2 features the same three character classes as the original destiny . each class has their own specific upgrades , perks , special abilities , and three sub - classes that allow players to finely tune their individual characters to provide a different play style . the three classes are warlock , hunter , and titan . after choosing a class , players select one of three species for their character : human , awoken ( bluish - gray - skinned descendants of humans ) , or exo ( humanoid machines ) . they can then customize their character , such as changing its gender or skin color . a character ' s species is cosmetic and does not affect gameplay . players can create two more characters to have a character of each class .



hunters continue to have access to the solar - based "" gunslinger "" sub - class from the original game and the void - based "" nightstalker "" sub - class from the original ' s the taken king expansion , both with gameplay changes . the hunter ' s new sub - class for destiny 2 is the arc - based "" arcstrider "" , replacing the "" bladedancer "" sub - class of the original . arcstrider ' s super , "" arc staff "" , focuses on an electrified staff and a large amount of rapid mobility . forsaken adds three new supers for each of the hunter sub - classes : "" blade barrage "" for gunslingers , focusing on throwing a volley of flaming knives ; "" spectral blades "" for nightstalkers , allowing players to see through walls and attack with void daggers ; and "" whirling guard "" for arcstriders , which allows players to block projectiles by spinning their arc staff . warlocks continue to have access to the void - based "" voidwalker "" sub - class from the original game and the arc - based "" stormcaller "" sub - class from the original ' s the taken king expansion , both with several changes . the warlock ' s new sub - class for destiny 2 is the solar - based "" dawnblade "" with a super called "" daybreak "" , replacing the "" sunsinger "" sub - class of the original . the daybreak super allows the player to make solar light blades to strike enemies from mid - air . forsaken gives warlocks three new supers : "" nova warp "" for voidwalkers , allowing players to warp around the battlefield and unleash a void explosion ; "" chaos reach "" for stormcallers , which unleashes a beam of arc energy which can be turned off at any time to conserve super energy ; and "" well of radiance "" for dawnblades , allowing players to create a healing and empowering aura for players to stand in . titans continue to have access to the arc - based "" striker "" sub - class from the original game and the solar - based "" sunbreaker "" from the original ' s the taken king expansion , both with significant gameplay changes . the titan ' s new sub - class for destiny 2 is the void - based "" sentinel "" , replacing the "" defender "" sub - class of the original , although the sentinel sub - class can create the defender ' s ward of dawn shielding bubble if this option is selected . sentinel ' s super , "" sentinel shield "" , allows the player to summon a shield that can block enemy fire and be used offensively ( similar to captain america ' s shield ) . forsaken will add three new supers for titans : "" thundercrash "" for strikers , allowing players to launch into the air and slam onto the ground ; "" burning maul "" for sunbreakers , which players wield a large hammer than can unleash flaming tornadoes ; and "" banner shield "" for sentinels , which unleashes a protective barrier that allows other players to shoot through . upon reaching the character exp level cap ( level 20 at launch , expanded to 50 ) , character progression shifts to improving their "" power "" level ( formerly "" light "" level ) by acquiring new and better equipment . this equipment can be gained through a variety of sources , including "" strikes "" , raids , and in - game events . the three weapon classes and five pieces of armor each have a power level ; a character ' s power level is the average of that gear . a higher character level allows for better equipment with higher power levels to be equipped . a higher power level improves damage output and defense . the highest obtainable power level at launch was 305 and is expanded to 600 . weapons and armor were reorganized in destiny 2 . in the original game , weapons were divided as primary , special , and heavy weapons . at launch , the weapons were categorized as kinetic , energy , and power weapons . primary weapons and some special weapons in the original - such as hand cannons and sidearms - are classified as kinetic and energy weapons . those without an elemental damage type go in the kinetic weapons slot while those with an elemental damage type ( arc , solar , or void ) go in the energy weapons slot . power weapons include the heavy weapons and the more powerful special weapons from the first game , such as shotguns and sniper rifles , as well as new weapon types , such as the grenade launcher . as of forsaken , the weapons system was overhauled , with many power weapons , such as most shotguns , single - shot grenade launchers , and most sniper rifles , being reorganized into kinetic and energy weapons slots . with armor , the name of the stats have been changed . instead of strength , intellect , and discipline , there are stats for resilience , recovery , and mobility . also for armor , the helmet , gauntlets , chest , legs , and class item slots have remained unchanged , but the artifacts slot has been replaced with one for a player ' s clan banners .



 == player versus environment ( pve ) == 



like the original game , player versus environment game types make up the majority of the game . areas to explore include earth ' s european dead zone ( which was only represented by pvp maps in the original ) , saturn ' s moon titan , jupiter ' s moon io , and the centaur planet nessus . the curse of osiris expansion adds mercury as an explorable area , while the warmind expansion adds mars . forsaken adds two new explorable areas in the reef : the tangled shore and the dreaming city , the latter being the mysterious homeland of the awoken race and an end - game area that is accessible after completing the campaign of forsaken . there is also a new social space in the european dead zone called "" the farm "" , as the main portion of the tower of the original was destroyed at the start of destiny 2 ' s campaign . however , a lower , undamaged portion of the tower becomes the main social space post - campaign . like the original , there are patrol missions and public events , but emphasis has been placed more on exploration of the worlds , including towns that players can visit and friendly npcs who can be found in - game and will give side - quests . new missions were added called "" adventures "" , which allow players to explore the area and go on a treasure hunt - like journey to dungeon - like areas . some adventures culminate in what is called a lost sector , which are somewhat hidden areas in worlds that lead players to a boss that yields rewards upon its defeat . lost sectors can be found and accessed without doing an adventure . starting with the curse of osiris expansion , heroic adventures were added , which are harder versions of adventures and they rotate each week . a map has also been added to the game , which shows the locations of the npcs , adventures , heroic adventures , region chests , and lost sectors . the maps of these new areas are much larger than those in the original destiny , with one being described as twice as large as any area of the original . players no longer have to leave a planet and go to orbit to travel to another location ; they can now do so immediately from their current in - game location . another new activity has been added called flashpoints , which is a weekly milestone that takes place on one of the eight locations and rotates each week . players complete public events , loot lost sectors and complete heroic adventures to earn high level rewards . similar to the original game , players can pledge their allegiance to one of three factions — dead orbit , future war cult , or new monarchy . in destiny 2 , however , the factions now compete against each other in the faction rally , which is a periodic event that lasts for one week . faction points are earned by doing various activities . the faction with the most points at the end of the week earns a high level reward for 1 , 000 glimmer ( in - game currency ) . the losing factions can also gain the reward , but must pay 50 , 000 glimmer for their faction ' s item . once a player has completed the main story and has reached the level cap ( currently 50 ) , they unlock access to different types of end - game content . these activities include nightfall strikes ( a weekly featured strike with modifiers and high level rewards ; as of the forsaken expansion , players can choose one of three featured strikes ) , a strike playlist with modifiers , a daily heroic story playlist , the "" leviathan "" and "" last wish "" raids , the "" eater of worlds "" and "" spire of stars "" raid lairs , and the "" escalation protocol "" and "" blind well "" horde activities on mars and the dreaming city , respectively , among other pvp activities . a harder difficulty mode called "" prestige "" is available for the raids and raid lairs , with modifiers . these end - game activities reward players with powerful gear upon successful completion to increase their power level .



 == player versus player ( pvp ) == 



like the original , player versus player combat exists in what is called the crucible with lord shaxx returning as its npc . the original destiny ' s crucible featured six - versus - six and three - versus - three game modes , as well as a limited time two - versus - two mode . at launch , all game modes were four - versus - four as bungie shifted their focus to smaller teams for competitive multiplayer and better map design , but quickplay modes eventually became six - versus - six . like the original , player statistics such as weapon power and defense are balanced between players in crucible game modes . the in - game hud was updated so that players can see if an enemy has their super charged or has power ammo . players currently do not have the option to select a single game mode to play . excluding trials of the nine and iron banner modes , crucible features two options , quickplay and competitive . quickplay rotates between three game modes from the original destiny that were modified for the new player count : clash , control , and supremacy ; supremacy was eventually moved to its own playlist in an update . competitive rotates between destiny 2 ' s two new modes : countdown and survival , as well as four - versus - four versions of control and clash . "" countdown "" , a best - of - ten rounds mode , is "" an asymmetric objective mode where players have to plant a bomb in the enemy base and then defend it until it explodes . "" one team attempts to plant bombs at designated locations , while the other team defends those locations to prevent bombs from being planted . if the opposing team plants a bomb , they must defend it until it explodes , while the other team attempts to defuse it . if the original defending team kills all players on the offensive team , the round is over , similar to the ' search and destroy ' game modes from other first - person shooters . in "" survival "" , a best - of - seven rounds mode , a team has a certain number of lives that is shared across that team . if a player dies and their team ' s total lives is at zero , they cannot be revived for the remainder of the round . trials of osiris from the original game was replaced by trials of the nine . like trials of osiris , trials of the nine begins on fridays and ends with the weekly reset on tuesdays . the game mode for this new trials , however , has changed ; instead of using the elimination mode of the original , trials of the nine rotates each week between destiny 2 ' s two new game modes , countdown and survival . only one map is featured for trials ' four - day duration , but the map also rotates weekly . player ' s gear is locked during trials , meaning they cannot change it for the duration of a match . unlike trials of osiris , players can gain access to the trials of the nine ' s social space called the spire , located in unknown space , for completing a match of trials and earning trials tokens . there , players will meet an npc called the emissary of the nine , who will exchange tokens for gear . gaining three , five , and seven wins on the score card , respectively , gains access to the upper tiers of the social space with greater rewards at each tier . going flawless with seven wins allows admittance into an exclusive area with even greater rewards . three losses resets the score card . to access trials of the nine , players must have completed the campaign , completed lord shaxx ' s "" call to arms "" milestone , and have a power level of at least 260 . the periodic competitive iron banner pvp mode of the original game , which disabled balancing of player ' s gear , also returned for the sequel . destiny 2 ' s iron banner , however , does not disable balancing , with bungie stating that "" your fighting abilities , not your power levels , will decide the outcome "" . this was changed following the release of forsaken , with balancing becoming disabled like the original game . like the original , iron banner lasts for one week and features milestones to complete daily . players must have completed the campaign and be level 20 to access iron banner , which features the returning lord saladin from the original game as its npc . a new pvp mode that was added in the forsaken expansion is called gambit , a best - of - three rounds mode that combines both pve and pvp , featuring the drifter as its npc . a 24 - hour free trial of the mode was made available to all players on september 1 , 2018 , three days prior to the launch of forsaken . two teams of four players compete against each other by defeating pve enemies . enemies , when defeated , drop motes which players can pick up and deposit in a bank in the center of the arena . depositing 5 , 10 or 15 motes send small , medium or large enemy blockers , respectively , to the opposing team ' s arena and locks their bank ; the opposing team must defeat the blockers in order to reactivate their bank . every 25 motes deposited opens a portal where one team member can invade the other team ' s arena . defeating members of the opposing team drops any motes that they are carrying . after depositing a certain amount of motes , a boss will spawn in the middle of the arena ; if a team member is defeated by an invading member of the opposing team , the boss regains health . the first team that defeats their boss wins the round ."
